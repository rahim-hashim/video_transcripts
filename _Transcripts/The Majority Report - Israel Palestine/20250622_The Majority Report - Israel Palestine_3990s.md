# Recession Coming Next Week? | David Dayen | TMR
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY)
*  David day in the executive editor of the American prospect. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=0.0s)]
*  David your cameras right where my. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=5.4s)]
*  And I'm going to be there. Hey what's up. Welcome. This is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=8.6s)]
*  this your first night first time in so I've been in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=15.3s)]
*  Syria. First time you've been sitting in that seat. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, there you go. So there's a first time for everything [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=20.6s)]
*  and we coordinated today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  It's a casual Friday and it's always casual Friday as what [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=27.5s)]
*  I was just told in the open. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=32.9s)]
*  There you go for me it is but in terms of the way that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=34.8s)]
*  this is dressed up Friday for me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=37.2s)]
*  It really is and we've we've sort of crossed paths. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=39.0s)]
*  Let's get right into this because we've got a lot to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=43.5s)]
*  talk about obviously. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=46.7s)]
*  Was there ever a busier time in the news. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=49.0s)]
*  I mean my goodness. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=51.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's there's a lot going on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=53.1s)]
*  I mean, I remember the days when you would do the news [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=55.9s)]
*  briefs for fire dog Lake that was like a like a different [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=59.3s)]
*  life many many many moons ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=62.9s)]
*  But we never had anything with like these many sort of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=67.2s)]
*  competing stories simultaneously. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=71.6s)]
*  Well, one thing I said or saw said this week was that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=73.5s)]
*  the Democratic Party it was in the midst of forgetting [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=78.4s)]
*  the lessons of the Iraq War and the global financial [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=80.9s)]
*  crisis in the same week, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=84.2s)]
*  So, you know compressing that time along with everything [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=87.3s)]
*  else that's going on obviously is is quite stunning and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=91.3s)]
*  we're going to talk about that genius act and we're going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  to be talking about obviously Democrats or at least [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=97.3s)]
*  Democratic leadership and maybe even just broadly speaking [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=100.6s)]
*  Democrats response to the potential for imminent war [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=107.7s)]
*  But first let's get a sense of what the timing is of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=109.0s)]
*  what the and in Iraq we had the FU which was the Friedman [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=113.9s)]
*  unit right that was six months when everything was going [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=120.5s)]
*  to become clear at any given point. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=123.7s)]
*  We next six months are crucial. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  Lurching Tom Friedman New York Times columnist that was [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=127.9s)]
*  his is ever-present and it literally went on for about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=131.3s)]
*  five years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=135.3s)]
*  He would say at periodic times the next six months in Iraq [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=136.3s)]
*  are crucial and the amazing thing too about it is you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=140.0s)]
*  would think if it's just five years that would be only 10 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=142.2s)]
*  Friedman units. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=147.0s)]
*  That's right, but they overlapped many times right every [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=148.1s)]
*  couple months every couple of months. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  He reset another six months. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  So there could have been something like 25 or 30 FU's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  during the course of that Iraq War. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=159.7s)]
*  Donald Trump has something a little bit more Donald Trump [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=163.1s)]
*  has sped up the it's more like what my contractor tells me. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=167.1s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=170.89999999999998s)]
*  We're going to finish your your your kitchen in two weeks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=171.8s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=176.4s)]
*  We're going to have it done completely in two weeks and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=177.6s)]
*  you're still eating off of paper plates three months later. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=180.7s)]
*  Yeah, here is Caroline. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=184.8s)]
*  Is it Caroline? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=188.1s)]
*  Caroline Levitt at the White House briefing room or press [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=189.0s)]
*  briefing yesterday regarding the ongoing situation in Iran. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=194.7s)]
*  I know there has been a lot of speculation amongst all of you [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  in the media regarding the president's decision-making and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  whether or not the United States will be directly involved in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  light of that news. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=208.5s)]
*  I have a message directly from the president and I quote based [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=209.4s)]
*  on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=213.5s)]
*  that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=217.1s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=220.5s)]
*  two weeks. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=225.2s)]
*  today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=227.7s)]
*  There's about 45 different qualifiers in that right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  I you know, concept of a plan. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=234.4s)]
*  There's a concept of a plan there and we have heard the the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=237.6s)]
*  use of two weeks many times by Donald Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  In fact, here is a here is a compilation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  There it is. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=251.0s)]
*  That was doing this Daily Show style. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=251.6s)]
*  Yeah, who was put who put this together? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=254.0s)]
*  We've we found it somewhere online. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=256.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  This is a maybe it's Blue Georgia that did this compilation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=259.8s)]
*  of of Donald Trump and his leaning on two weeks. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=263.6s)]
*  In your mind is Ukraine doing enough to get this? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=273.6s)]
*  I'd rather tell you in about two weeks from now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=277.5s)]
*  Do you still believe that Putin actually wants to end the war? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  I can't tell you that but I'll let you know in about two weeks. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=283.5s)]
*  I think you're going to find some very interesting items [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=286.5s)]
*  coming to the forefront over the next two weeks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=289.2s)]
*  We've got the plan largely completed and we'll be filing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=292.6s)]
*  over the next two or three weeks. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=296.5s)]
*  We're going to be having a news conference in about two weeks. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=297.9s)]
*  I will make that decision. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=300.1s)]
*  I would say over the next two weeks and I'll be making a big [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=301.7s)]
*  decision on the Paris Accord over the next two weeks at some [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=305.5s)]
*  point in the next two weeks or three weeks. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=310.1s)]
*  I'm going to be setting the deal over the next two three weeks [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=313.3s)]
*  but about two weeks within two weeks in two weeks in two weeks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=316.0s)]
*  You'll be hearing about it a lot more in the next two weeks. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=320.9s)]
*  Maybe in a hundred years from now maybe in two weeks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=323.5s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go there within [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=326.8s)]
*  the next two weeks. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=330.0s)]
*  It's it's a stalling tactic and more often than not people [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=332.9s)]
*  forget that he had said two weeks and it gets reset but there [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=336.3s)]
*  are in this instance. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=340.6s)]
*  There is a lot of movement in terms of naval activity and in [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  terms of Air Force activity getting set up. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=350.0s)]
*  I would imagine Marines to getting set up so that in the event [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=354.1s)]
*  that there is a strike protecting the many many bases [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=357.6s)]
*  military assets commercial assets that the United States [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=367.1s)]
*  has around the world. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=370.70000000000005s)]
*  That's that's what he could be setting up for. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean the I mean, I think also, you know Trump certainly [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  believes in what was known under Nixon as the madman strategy, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=379.6s)]
*  right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  You have to believe that I'm so crazy that I'm going to drop [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=385.6s)]
*  a bunker Buster bomb a nuclear bomb, whatever it is on you so [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=389.8s)]
*  that you'll come to the table and negotiate and so, you know, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=394.8s)]
*  there's a bit of gunboat diplomacy here where he's he's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=397.6s)]
*  setting up the guns and he wants you to think that he's crazy [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=400.3s)]
*  enough to do it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think that's certainly part of this the irony is of course [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=404.6s)]
*  that they were in the middle of negotiations when Israel but [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=409.2s)]
*  I'm so it's not it's unclear to me what it is like I have not [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  heard what the well and also an articulation what the roadblock [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=418.6s)]
*  was in coming to I don't know that there was one because it [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=422.6s)]
*  was well, that's my point is like what is the but it's clear [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  what happened is that Israel kind of jumped the gun. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=430.0s)]
*  They didn't they don't want this negotiation to happen at all. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=432.8s)]
*  And so they started bombing and Trump saw his buddies on [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=436.1s)]
*  frogs news put a lot of neocons on saying isn't this great [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  and thought hey, I want to take credit for that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=443.3s)]
*  So maybe I'll get involved and so, you know, I don't know that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=445.0s)]
*  it was I don't think the sequence was there's an impasse [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=449.1s)]
*  and therefore I'm going to start bombing the sequence was [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=453.6s)]
*  we're negotiating Israel disrupts the negotiation and Trump [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=456.9s)]
*  who has the brain of a Nat like move to Israel side and then [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=461.7s)]
*  but what is the ask if the theory is it's the madman theory. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=467.2s)]
*  I'm using this madman tactic as a way of attempting to why I [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=471.8s)]
*  think there were some impasse not full impasses, but maybe [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=477.7s)]
*  things that were holding up the negotiation and one is I [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=483.4s)]
*  think enriching the uranium on Iranian soil. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=485.9s)]
*  I think that was one of the things that the US wanted that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=490.3s)]
*  Iran was, you know, not willing to give up. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=494.5s)]
*  So, I mean, I certainly there are points within the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=497.7s)]
*  negotiation wasn't over and so having the most leverage in [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=500.5s)]
*  negotiation if you believe that that this is what this does [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=504.70000000000005s)]
*  to Trump, you know means that if you if you start threatening [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=508.0s)]
*  then maybe you get a better deal. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=513.4s)]
*  What also strikes me is the idea. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=517.9s)]
*  I mean, you know people have compared this obviously to the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=521.4s)]
*  Iraq invasion. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=525.1s)]
*  And what strikes me is that in you recall this I'm sure it [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=528.6s)]
*  was a two-year project. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=534.1s)]
*  I mean literally maybe a year and a half from December of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=536.4s)]
*  2001 to February March March, I guess ultimately of 2003 right [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=543.5s)]
*  and the machinations to build support for invading Iraq which [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=551.4s)]
*  had nothing to do with 9-eleven. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=558.0s)]
*  You know, there were Dick Cheney's leaking through Scooter [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=560.8s)]
*  Libby to the New York Times and then going back and citing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=566.0s)]
*  the New York Times on television to build the this support you [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  had Colin Powell essentially destroy his credibility for, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=573.9s)]
*  you know, really the rest of his career. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=579.8s)]
*  He spent trying to make up for this going up in lying up and [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=582.0999999999999s)]
*  holding a vial of anthrax at the UN. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=586.0s)]
*  Condi Rice talking you don't want the smoking gun to be a [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=590.1s)]
*  mushroom cloud. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=595.9s)]
*  And you know, you had Thomas Friedman going out there talking [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=599.0s)]
*  about how we were going to bring free. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=603.9s)]
*  I mean they liberal hawks, you know, they were building [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=605.7s)]
*  bipartisan support yet Kenneth Pollock case for war and you [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=608.5s)]
*  know, there was all this other discussion. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=613.1s)]
*  But I think I think you have to see this is almost cumulative [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=615.0s)]
*  right because you know part of that was how David from David [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=617.8s)]
*  from our friend now, right? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=621.8s)]
*  David from writing. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=623.1s)]
*  I'm glad a State of the Union address calling a bit talking [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=624.6s)]
*  about an axis of evil and that axis of evil included Iran [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=629.8s)]
*  included North Korea rocker on North and Iran and so all of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=634.5s)]
*  this sort of built-in suppositions that animated the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=640.0s)]
*  war with Iraq are still active particularly around we have [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=644.2s)]
*  to stop. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=650.3000000000001s)]
*  It's an existential threat of Iran gets a nuclear weapon that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=650.9000000000001s)]
*  is an unstated premise that has has gone through the last 20 [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=654.5s)]
*  years. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=660.9000000000001s)]
*  So when this flares up again, you can just pick that talking [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=661.2s)]
*  point right off the top of the top of the pile. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  The difference is is that the entire it seems us intelligence [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=669.4000000000001s)]
*  apparatus like across whatever it is the 18 agencies have said [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=674.1s)]
*  they have no nuclear weapon program and haven't since 2003 [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=679.7s)]
*  right and and and so it it seems like it would be a hard sell. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=685.0s)]
*  And but it also feels like it's completely almost irrelevant [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=693.0s)]
*  put up this poll. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=698.2s)]
*  You can see Democrats, independents, Republicans. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=699.7s)]
*  Most of this is do you think the US military should get involved [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=708.3000000000001s)]
*  in the conflict between Israel and Iran? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=711.7s)]
*  There is no party. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=714.6s)]
*  No demographic that is a full. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=716.5s)]
*  Yes beyond 23 points for Republicans and 15 for Democrats [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=722.2s)]
*  and 11 for independents. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=726.1s)]
*  And then overwhelming majorities for the answer being no and [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=729.3000000000001s)]
*  yet it doesn't seem like it mean will make a difference per se. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=735.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it certainly will tell it certainly doesn't make a difference [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=742.4000000000001s)]
*  on the Republican side and we shouldn't let them off the hook [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=745.5s)]
*  for that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=747.6s)]
*  Massey Tom Massey the congressman Libertarian congressman from [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=749.2s)]
*  Kentucky has a war powers resolution to say that that only [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=754.2s)]
*  Congress can determine, you know, whether or not the US goes to [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=759.6s)]
*  war and no Republicans assigned on zero. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=762.7s)]
*  So the the realignment the Republican realignment is one guy [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=766.7s)]
*  on this issue and then on the Democratic side you have that's [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=771.1s)]
*  a hand almost like not a realignment. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=774.9000000000001s)]
*  It's not and on the Democratic side. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=776.9000000000001s)]
*  You have a few dozen who have said both in the House and the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=780.0s)]

*  the party that's certainly not what you're seeing among Democrats. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=796.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to talk about that because you and Ryan Grim from [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=801.6s)]
*  DropSite News and a couple other folks that you both work with [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=806.1s)]
*  did some great reporting on the dynamic that exists in Congress [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=812.0s)]
*  right now in terms of whether they're getting out there and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=817.2s)]
*  articulating and a anti-Iran war essentially [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=823.3000000000001s)]

*  Jeffries have been completely absent in terms of pressing the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=838.2s)]

*  Where are Schumer and Jeffries? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=865.8s)]
*  Trump might take the US to war. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=870.8s)]
*  Where are Schumer and Jeffries? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=872.0s)]
*  Well, we sort of know where they are. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=873.5s)]
*  And we actually know explicitly now because Jeffries as we were [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=876.0s)]
*  going live here Jeffries released a new statement on developments [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  in the Middle East is what he calls it and it starts off with [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=885.4s)]
*  the boilerplate that you hear from a lot of members of Congress [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=889.4s)]
*  particularly, you know supporters of Israel. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=894.0s)]
*  Iran is a sworn enemy of the US can never be permitted to become [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=897.4s)]
*  a nuclear capable power. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=901.4s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself against escalating Iranian [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=902.8s)]
*  aggression and our commitment to Israel security remains iron-clad. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=907.0s)]
*  Now he goes on to say that the authority to declare war belongs [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=911.7s)]
*  solely to the US Congress and that Trump should refrain from [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=915.5s)]
*  engaging in military action without the explicit approval of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=920.3s)]
*  the House and that aggressive diplomacy resulting in an agreement [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=924.6999999999999s)]
*  that permanently halts Iran's nuclear aspirations is the most [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=930.8s)]
*  appropriate course of action at this time. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  That is a statement that came out literally at around noon today, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=937.0s)]
*  but you see how the sequencing is of it that it starts with [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=941.5999999999999s)]
*  Everything that Israel kind of wants you to know about this [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=945.6s)]
*  situation that Iran must never have a nuclear weapon and that [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=949.9s)]
*  the US is steadfast in its alignment its stance with Israel [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=954.6s)]
*  and then it gets into sort of, you know, the process stuff. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=959.6s)]
*  But what it sounds to me like is that, you know, there is this [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=963.5s)]
*  That the Congress should be the one to authorize war with Iran, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=970.7s)]
*  not the president and it seems like Jeffries would be fully willing [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=977.5s)]
*  to do that as long as he has the opportunity as long as he has [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=981.6s)]
*  the opportunity to vote for it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=986.1s)]
*  We should also say and there's a couple of things that in that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=988.2s)]
*  statement that I find sort of fascinating one being Israel has [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=990.5s)]
*  the right to defend itself against escalating Iranian aggression. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=997.1s)]
*  It is so hard to wrap my head around that like how is escalating [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1004.9s)]
*  Iranian aggression defined here when Israel attacked them presumably [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1010.0s)]
*  preemptively but according to them, but of course it was not [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1016.7s)]
*  preemptively because there's been zero evidence that they were [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1020.2s)]
*  preempting anything at all. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1024.6s)]
*  I mean, and well, I mean the idea that Iran must never have a [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1028.1s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1031.8999999999999s)]
*  If anything, this is encouraging Iran to get a nuclear weapon [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1034.3s)]
*  something that that our own intelligence agencies have been saying [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1040.0s)]
*  they don't seem to be terribly interested in doing it. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1044.1s)]
*  The interesting corollary to Trump saying I'll make this decision [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1046.6999999999998s)]
*  in two weeks is Benjamin yet and Yahoo saying that Iran is three [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1052.0s)]
*  months away from delivering a nuclear weapon starting in the early [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1055.9s)]
*  90s. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1059.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1060.3s)]
*  He said for 30 years Iran has been a few weeks or a few months [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1060.7s)]
*  away from having a nuclear weapon and so you can define escalating [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1065.0s)]
*  aggression as their alleged activities towards granting getting [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1069.9s)]
*  a nuclear weapon which they've apparently been doing for 30 years. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1075.4s)]
*  There's not very good at it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1078.3s)]
*  They're going to get there but it's it's monkeys on keyboards apparently [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1079.8999999999999s)]
*  ever in Iran. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1083.6999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, you have to believe the kind of mania that Netanyahu [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1084.8999999999999s)]
*  has about Iran's activities in order to believe that there is any [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1091.8999999999999s)]
*  escalating aggression and can we talk about Chuck Schumer? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1096.5s)]
*  It couldn't have been more than two weeks ago. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1100.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, putting out a video. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1103.3s)]
*  I mean of all the issues that the Democrats should be expending [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1105.8999999999999s)]
*  their energies on putting out a video complaining that Trump was [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1109.8999999999999s)]
*  too close to a deal with Iran. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1115.8s)]
*  What kind of bull is this? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1118.3s)]
*  And that it involved a side deal and no side deals. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1120.0s)]
*  Yeah, no side deals. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1127.3s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1129.8s)]
*  I mean. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1131.8s)]
*  We will win. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1132.9s)]
*  I didn't know you're going to go full Schumer there. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1134.6000000000001s)]
*  I believe me. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1136.9s)]
*  I'm going full Schumer. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1138.1000000000001s)]
*  This is just it is borderline insane and you guys at the prospect [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1141.7s)]
*  with DropSight did some amazing reporting here on what APAC has [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1150.3000000000002s)]
*  been involved in over the past, I guess couple of weeks. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1157.5s)]
*  Well, really since the first bombs were falling in Tehran. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1161.8s)]
*  No side deals. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1166.9s)]
*  So since that time APAC which is, you know, the large political [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1168.8s)]
*  action committee, they really got to work immediately contacting [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1174.0s)]
*  members of Congress and telling them you have to put out a [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1178.2s)]
*  statement that says that you stand with Israel that, you know, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1182.6000000000001s)]
*  Iran must never have all the things kind of that that Jeffrey [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1188.8s)]
*  said in his preamble. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1192.1000000000001s)]
*  Iran must never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1193.4s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself against escalating aggression [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1195.4s)]
*  and we stand with Israel. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1199.6000000000001s)]
*  Those are kind of the talking points that Iran wanted members [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1201.2s)]
*  of Congress to get out and my sources tell me that they were [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1204.7s)]
*  bombarding members of Congress with these messages, particularly [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1210.1000000000001s)]
*  Democrats and one of them got a hundred calls from a pack saying [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1213.8999999999999s)]
*  you have to put out a message. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1220.2s)]
*  You have to put out a message. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1221.3s)]
*  You have to put out a message. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1222.3999999999999s)]
*  So what is it when when when when a pack calls? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1223.3999999999999s)]
*  A member of Congress a hundred times what like is that like is [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1227.8999999999999s)]
*  that on their personal cell phone like is it is it a text like [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1232.5s)]
*  now how does that it could be any number of things. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1236.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I think on the cell phone. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1238.8999999999999s)]
*  I think text of members, you know, maybe there's chief of staff [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  maybe to people in their office their legislative director, but [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  giving the overwhelming sensation and it might not be from [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1249.3999999999999s)]
*  the same person. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1252.3s)]
*  It might be from allies. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1253.2s)]
*  It might be from donors who are alive with a pack but this [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1254.7s)]
*  overwhelming sense that you have to do this. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1257.8s)]
*  You have to do this. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1259.8999999999999s)]
*  And so, you know when I heard about that we put a bunch of [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1260.8999999999999s)]
*  people to work and said, all right, let's go to every House [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1265.8999999999999s)]
*  Democrat. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1269.2s)]
*  Let's look at their website. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1270.1s)]
*  Let's look at their social media. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1271.6s)]
*  Did they do this did did they align themselves with a pack and [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1273.2s)]
*  Israel by saying, you know by using these talking points and [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1279.9s)]
*  what we found was that 28 members of Congress House Democrats [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1283.7s)]
*  in particular issued statements exactly saying I stand with [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1291.1s)]
*  Israel. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1295.9s)]
*  That's an incredible 20 incidents 28 that they would use [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1296.3s)]
*  those exact same talking points at that exact time those [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1299.4s)]
*  exact words another 35 expressed unequivocal support for Israel [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1302.7s)]
*  without using those magic words stand with Israel, but but [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1308.1000000000001s)]
*  giving the same sentiment and then another 16 expressed what [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1311.3000000000002s)]
*  I would call softer support with Israel. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1316.8000000000002s)]
*  Maybe not the same inflammatory language. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1318.9s)]
*  Maybe not exactly the same talking points, but giving the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1320.8000000000002s)]
*  sense that they stand with Israel. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1324.3000000000002s)]
*  So that's that's almost a hundred members of the House [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1325.5s)]
*  caucus and was within a few days sometimes with by the next [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1327.9s)]
*  day the day after the bombing started that was a patch basically [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  having a metric to say see the Democrats stand with us. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1338.0s)]
*  They stand with Israel. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1342.0s)]
*  There's another way of expressing that in it seems to me. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1344.5s)]
*  It's like well, there's some side deals are okay. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  That's crazy side deals and the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1354.4s)]
*  Side deals, man. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1358.5s)]
*  I mean, they're they're they we're talking about Iranian ones. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1359.2s)]
*  So and I think I think there are two things to say here number [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1365.1000000000001s)]
*  one. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1368.5s)]
*  This is a pack wanting to maintain their dominance in the [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1369.6000000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1372.9s)]
*  One of the things they did on the member statements that did [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1373.8000000000002s)]
*  not follow their talking points that that blame Trump for his [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  failure of diplomacy or that said that you know, the Congress [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1383.8s)]
*  is the one who determines whether or not the US goes to [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1388.1s)]
*  war or whatever that that you know, a pack would put out a [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1390.1s)]
*  statement in response to any any of those statements that fell [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1394.8s)]
*  short of those, you know, their expectations basically saying [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1398.7s)]
*  consistent pattern J Street in Dorsey's issue anti-Israel [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1402.6s)]
*  statements J Street is the pro-Israel pro-peace organization [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1406.2s)]
*  and they are jockeying for power with J. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1411.5s)]
*  They don't want J Street to get too much of a foothold in the [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1415.1999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1417.6s)]
*  And so a pack not only wants a bunch of statements they can [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1419.0s)]
*  point to and say see they're following our lead here, but [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1422.8s)]
*  they also want to cut off the idea that there would be any [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1426.3s)]
*  support for J Street within the Democratic Party. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1429.3s)]
*  I mean, I think this is I think on some level that classic [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1432.1999999999998s)]

*  makes it out about 40 feet or whatever it is and is still [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1443.3s)]
*  running and doesn't realize there's no road there anymore. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  And I think we are I don't know if it's a year or two away [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1450.6s)]
*  maybe less maybe more of that happening in the Democratic [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1454.3999999999999s)]
*  Party and a lot of I think there's going to be a lot. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1458.8999999999999s)]
*  I think that's going to end up being a lot more difficult for [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1462.3999999999999s)]
*  Democrats to be able to sort of kowtow to a pack regardless [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1467.0s)]
*  of how much money they bring in down the road and especially [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1471.2s)]
*  if if an actual strike happens and it's as catastrophic as [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1476.0s)]
*  we think and because you know. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1479.8s)]
*  The this way it's almost guaranteed. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1483.0s)]
*  It seems to me that you the if the United States explicitly [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1485.8s)]
*  attacks Iran because frankly, you know, it's I think it's [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1492.6s)]
*  very hard to imagine that us has not been involved in these [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1497.1s)]
*  attacks in some fashion or another, but they have enough [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1499.8s)]
*  deniability that Iran can also deny to itself that the US is [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1503.3s)]
*  involved but in the event that there is an explicit involvement [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1508.5s)]
*  by the US it seems to me there's no way to avoid at least [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1513.5s)]
*  significantly more con you know involvement and I don't know [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1519.5s)]
*  what that looks like. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1523.6s)]
*  I can't imagine it involves, you know any type of ground [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1524.6999999999998s)]
*  invasion that would be absurd but the idea of a protracted [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1527.1999999999998s)]
*  like, you know bombing and then you know some form of like [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1532.8999999999999s)]
*  international terrorism seems to be, you know, I would imagine [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1539.6999999999998s)]
*  is on the table if the United States are getting involved in [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1547.6999999999998s)]
*  that and you know who knows what they're but there's a lot [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1550.1999999999998s)]
*  you were there in 2002 when the majority of Democratic senators [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1554.5s)]
*  and I believe a substantial number of House members House [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1562.8s)]
*  Democrats gave President Bush the authority to go into Iraq [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1566.3s)]
*  and then the next year in those presidential primary races you [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1572.0s)]
*  had Howard Dean come out very early and said what I want to [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1578.0s)]
*  know is that was the speech. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1581.8999999999999s)]
*  It was the why I want to know is speech. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1584.5s)]
*  It was at the California Democratic Party Convention. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1586.1s)]
*  He said what I want to know is why are the Democrats the ones [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1588.7s)]
*  who are cheerleading for this war in Iraq? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1592.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1595.3s)]
*  Why why why is our party collaborating with Republicans [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1595.7s)]
*  and that that really I think set the stage for about 15 years [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1600.2s)]
*  or 20 years of a sea change among at least a substantial [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1604.1s)]
*  faction of the Democratic Party. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1609.2s)]
*  And of course in 2008 who wins the Democratic nomination someone [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1610.9s)]
*  who was early out in front as against the war of Iraq. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1615.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah as a state senator at the end of the day you are going [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1619.7s)]
*  to look back at what you did here as a Democrat in elected [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1624.8000000000002s)]
*  office in Washington and if you kind of oppose this rush to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1629.3000000000002s)]
*  war you're going to find that the public really supports you [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1635.8000000000002s)]
*  and you're you're you're going to look pretty good for a long [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1639.8999999999999s)]
*  time. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1643.0s)]
*  And if you were in favor of it, you're going to find yourself [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1643.7s)]
*  having to explain yourself for the next summer beers. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1647.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting if we have time we should touch on [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1649.8s)]
*  the New York mayorality race because I know you guys are doing [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1654.1s)]
*  some real coverage actually with Whitney Wimbush is coming [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1657.6s)]
*  out with a piece and she of course writes for our AM quickie [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1662.6s)]
*  as well as and now she's our new staff writer doing a great [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1665.2s)]
*  job. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1667.5s)]
*  And yes, she's been focused on the right. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1668.0s)]
*  I mean it's it's Geo TV weekend here. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1669.8000000000002s)]
*  Yes, what what's what do you think is going to happen? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1672.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, wait, we'll get to that in a moment because I want to [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1674.9s)]
*  talk about the the big bill. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1677.1000000000001s)]
*  But I do think the interesting thing we should also say about [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1678.6000000000001s)]
*  the invasion of Iraq is that starting as early as the Clinton [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1681.5s)]
*  administration there was that similar buildup in terms of [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1686.8000000000002s)]
*  providing all of the sort of like sales pitches in whatnot [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1691.4s)]
*  that you would need to invade Iraq but even but but it took [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1695.5s)]
*  the Bush administration, you know 14 months to do it in this [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1699.9s)]
*  instance. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1703.7s)]
*  I think like, you know, we have now been trained at like, oh [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1704.6s)]
*  the idea of the US unilaterally doing this with Iran and you [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1707.0s)]
*  know. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1712.4s)]
*  And we I haven't seen I mean, we're not having large anti-war [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1714.3s)]
*  protests at this point like, you know, in the way that we did [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1719.6s)]
*  with her. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1722.3s)]
*  I mean it took months for that stuff to happen last time this [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1722.5s)]
*  could happen so quickly that you know, we're already involved [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1725.8s)]
*  before we know it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1728.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's where you started this that it was a year [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1730.3s)]
*  and a half like like buildup buildup sales a real sales [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1733.5s)]
*  pitch effort and here it's just sort of a given. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1737.4s)]
*  Oh, we're going to bomb Iran. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1739.7s)]
*  Yeah, and yeah, well we shall see in the meantime. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1741.1s)]
*  There's also like another bomb essentially and it is winding [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1746.0s)]
*  its way through the Senate this reconciliation bill now and [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1751.2s)]
*  you have a piece out just I think yesterday about what it's [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1756.4s)]
*  just going to do to not just to Medicaid. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1760.1000000000001s)]
*  And never I don't even know if you touch on Medicare in there [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1764.6000000000001s)]
*  because of the sequestration that could potentially follow [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1766.8s)]
*  from it. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1769.7s)]
*  They're actually but a couple things with like here, but yeah, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1770.1000000000001s)]
*  the entire sort of like medical system. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1774.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be like I don't know if there's ever [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1779.0s)]
*  been a single bill that I remember at least in the 20 years [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1782.2s)]
*  that I've been doing this that has such dramatic implications [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1786.9s)]
*  for daily life for so many millions of Americans in a negative [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1794.6s)]
*  way. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1800.3s)]
*  It's going to affect every American at some level and as [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1800.9s)]
*  you've talked about the fact that we're in this this news [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1805.3999999999999s)]
*  vortex going on right now where we have immigration stuff and [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1809.6s)]
*  protests and and and this Iran situation with Israel. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1813.5s)]
*  It's not getting a lot of attention. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1818.6s)]
*  No, it's hard to get traction on it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1820.1s)]
*  We're doing a daily or almost daily newsletter called Trump's [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1821.8s)]
*  beautiful disaster because you know bills called the big [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1826.5s)]
*  beautiful bill. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1829.1s)]
*  So we went back to the 90s with 311 reference beautiful [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1831.5s)]
*  disaster song by a band. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1835.2s)]
*  There my but anyway, so and you know, we're covering it because [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1837.6000000000001s)]
*  because of this impact but it's been hard to break through and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1845.0s)]
*  I don't think people realize the extent to which this will have [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1850.0s)]
*  such a massive amount of disruption particularly in the [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1855.5s)]
*  health system. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1861.6000000000001s)]
*  So right now the situation is that a number of rural hospitals [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1862.3s)]
*  in particular are struggling to survive. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1868.0s)]
*  There is a report that says one-third of all rural hospitals [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1870.6s)]
*  and that's about 700 hospitals across the country are at risk [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1874.3s)]
*  of closure right now. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1879.1s)]
*  And if if you take a trillion dollars out of the health care [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1881.5s)]
*  system, which is kind of what this will do mainly by cutting [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1885.1s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1889.2s)]
*  That's primary thing and moving 11 million people off the [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1889.8s)]
*  Medicaid rules. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1893.7s)]
*  You're going to get a situation where suddenly the budgets of [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1895.8s)]
*  these rural hospitals will just go into the toilet. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1900.2s)]
*  I mean Medicaid is often the biggest line item in these [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1903.0s)]
*  budgets. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1906.8s)]
*  You're talking about a program that has 73 million people [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1907.2s)]
*  revenue now for revenue and you know, I mean some hospitals [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1909.9s)]
*  complain about low reimbursement rates in Medicaid, but there's [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1914.3s)]
*  There are programs that boost that that are also being attacked [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1917.5s)]
*  in this bill. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1921.9s)]
*  There's this program where the federal government will kick [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1922.5s)]
*  in extra money so that doctors will accept Medicaid and [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1925.5s)]
*  hospitals will accept Medicaid and that was cut in the Senate [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1929.4s)]
*  bill. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1933.4s)]
*  That is the provider tax, right? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1933.8s)]
*  It's not quite the provider tax is a different thing called [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1935.6000000000001s)]
*  state-directed payments, but those have been attacked in the [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1938.4s)]
*  Senate bill. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1941.9s)]
*  Don't those provider taxes pay for those state-directed payments? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1942.4s)]
*  No, the state-directed payments come from the federal government. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1947.2s)]
*  The provider tax is a separate thing that is a way for states [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1950.8s)]
*  to get more resources in Medicaid and what happens is the [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1954.6000000000001s)]
*  state taxes a hospital. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1959.0s)]
*  Let's say the state taxes a hospital $100, but what they [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1960.9s)]
*  say is also will reimburse you more through our Medicaid [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1964.0s)]
*  program by $100. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1967.1000000000001s)]
*  So the hospital is held harmless. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1969.6000000000001s)]
*  They're paying a tax, but they're getting the money back. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1971.3s)]
*  But when you add when you increase those rates and the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1973.7s)]
*  state pays $100, Medicaid is a federal state program. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1978.9s)]
*  So the federal government is kicking in some of that money. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1983.0s)]
*  So by doing this circulation, it's a way to get the federal [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1985.6000000000001s)]
*  government to pay a little bit more. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1990.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1991.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1991.8000000000002s)]
*  And what they're and the state-directed payments are supplements [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1992.2s)]
*  on top of that. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1995.8000000000002s)]
*  So so there's two things going on here, right? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=1997.6000000000001s)]
*  And both of those are being cut by this the Senate bill in [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2000.5s)]
*  particular. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2005.8s)]
*  There are other cuts in the house being more egregious. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2007.3s)]
*  It's more House bill, which is sort of shocking. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2010.3s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2012.8s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2013.8s)]
*  And so what does this mean? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2014.7s)]
*  There are hundreds of rural hospitals that are likely to [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2017.0s)]
*  have to close because of what happens in this bill. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2021.0s)]
*  And what does it mean when a hospital closes there are sick [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2025.9s)]
*  people in the hospital. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2028.9s)]
*  That have to be moved and if you're talking about a rural [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2030.4s)]
*  hospital, it's probably have to be moved an hour two hours [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2033.2s)]
*  three hours away and that could be life-threatening in and [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2038.2s)]
*  of itself. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2042.6000000000001s)]
*  The second part if you have a city a rural town and they lose [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2043.9s)]
*  their hospital. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2049.2000000000003s)]
*  It's an anchor for the community. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2050.5s)]
*  These are often the biggest employers right in that community. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2051.9s)]
*  You could obliterate an entire town by losing their rural [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2055.9s)]
*  hospital. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2059.0s)]
*  And then three for patients now might the nearest hospital to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2060.0s)]
*  where I live is three hours away. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2065.6s)]
*  If you have a heart attack, you have an emergency situation. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2067.2s)]
*  You might not be able to get to the hospital in time. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2070.7999999999997s)]
*  If you have a loved one that has to stay in a in a hospital [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2073.4s)]
*  somewhere else, you might have to pay to like go to a hotel [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2077.7999999999997s)]
*  so you can see your loved one and help them through a time [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2081.9s)]
*  when they're sick. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2085.2999999999997s)]
*  There are real burdens for patients. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2086.6s)]
*  And then think about the burden on the remaining hospitals. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2089.5s)]
*  So all of a sudden they're getting patients from a larger [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2093.3999999999996s)]
*  area. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2097.1s)]
*  But we and yeah, if you cut Medicaid doesn't that mean [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2098.2s)]
*  that those 11 million people who lose they get healthy and [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2101.8999999999996s)]
*  never have to go to the hospital right isn't that the [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2106.5s)]
*  theory actually what happens is those 11 million people no [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2109.0s)]
*  longer have coverage, but if they're sick, they're still [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2111.8999999999996s)]
*  going to go to the hospital and we have a law in this country [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2115.0s)]
*  that says if you are in an emergency and you go to in the [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2118.3s)]
*  emergency room that you have to get you have to get treated [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2121.9s)]
*  and that is called uncompensated care. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2125.6000000000004s)]
*  So if that person can't afford it because you know, they [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2128.6000000000004s)]
*  they don't have to be on Medicaid and they don't have [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2132.0s)]
*  health insurance. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2134.3s)]
*  They're going to basically go and get treatment without [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2136.0s)]
*  getting paid and that's a burden on the hospitals and then [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2141.3s)]
*  it ends up being a cost that is picked up by insurance and [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2145.6s)]
*  private insurance and by essentially the public dole more [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2150.5s)]
*  by the hospitals, right because the hospitals are the one [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2154.0s)]
*  giving the treatment they pass getting paid they pass that [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2156.7s)]
*  they asked for higher payments, but they they might not be [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2159.8999999999996s)]
*  able to wrangle higher payments out of the insurance companies [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2162.5s)]
*  and the other part of this is that more people are going to [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2165.2999999999997s)]
*  be coming in whether they're insured or uninsured. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2168.8999999999996s)]
*  They're going to be coming into that hospital hospitals are [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2171.7s)]
*  already understaffed. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2174.2s)]
*  They already need more physicians. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2175.7999999999997s)]
*  They already need more nurses. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2177.4s)]
*  If you had a week wait time to see a doctor before maybe it's [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2180.2s)]
*  two weeks now and the the health care system is very [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2183.6s)]
*  interdependent. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2187.7s)]
*  If you have something go down in one side of it. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2188.6s)]
*  The other side so they can come it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2192.0s)]
*  I mean we you know, we saw how supplies had to be moved [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2194.1s)]
*  within the hospital system. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2198.1s)]
*  If you have shut down a bunch of public hospitals like [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2199.7s)]
*  Andrew Corma happened to have in the run-up before covid [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2201.9s)]
*  there are hospitals get overrun in terms of the burden and [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2208.7000000000003s)]
*  in costs and whatnot. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2212.3s)]
*  And so this is going to have [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2213.9s)]
*  win in we should say that [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2215.7000000000003s)]
*  as as little attention as it is gotten relative to the [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2218.6s)]
*  implications of this look at the polling on this. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2221.9s)]
*  Let's play this clip from Harry Anton on is that his name [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2225.8s)]
*  Harry and yeah on [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2230.2s)]
*  on CNN. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2233.2s)]
*  He's never seen polling on legislation look worse. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2235.2999999999997s)]
*  But it's it's a soft intensity though, right because people [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2239.5s)]
*  don't really know about it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2243.3999999999996s)]
*  People don't know about it is clip number. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2244.6s)]
*  We have this. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2248.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2251.2999999999997s)]
*  And of course there's other elements of of this bill and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2254.8999999999996s)]
*  but this is one of this is the sort of the with the biggest [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2259.4s)]
*  chunk of money in terms of cuts are coming from that's right. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2262.6s)]
*  Where is support for this mega bill, you know, I'm really [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2266.4s)]
*  really surprised when I look at polling data. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2271.0s)]
*  I look at it every day, but the amount of disapproval for [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2273.1s)]
*  this bill. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2276.2s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2276.8s)]
*  My you know, you mentioned the KFF Paul. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2277.6s)]
*  We're talking about 29 points underwater on the net favorable [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2280.9s)]
*  rating, but that matches the Quinnipiac University poll from [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2283.9s)]
*  last week when it was 26 points underwater. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2286.8s)]
*  Oh my God, you need Greg Luganis to get that far underwater. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2290.5s)]
*  And I mean we're talking about a negative 41 net favorability [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2293.6000000000004s)]
*  rating among independents in the center of the electorate. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2297.0s)]
*  You rarely ever see pieces of legislation or proposed pieces [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2299.8s)]
*  of legislation as unpopular as this but here you see it in [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2303.2000000000003s)]
*  two polls 26 points underwater and 29 points underwater. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2306.4s)]
*  No good x3 x3 read all about it. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2309.9s)]
*  Mr. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2312.3s)]
*  I know it's 26 points underwater. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2312.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean did this guy fight in World War two. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2315.2s)]
*  I don't see any one of the doughboys. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2318.6s)]
*  But I mean, this is pretty stunning, but also does not seem [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2322.5s)]
*  to have I mean, what are the prospects? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2328.1s)]
*  Well, let's first talk about the the birdbath stuff because [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2332.1s)]
*  there's a lot of stuff in this bill that came from the house [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2337.2s)]
*  that goes into Senate. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2340.1s)]
*  It's a reconciliation process, which means they only need 50 [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2341.2s)]
*  plus one to pass. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2347.5s)]
*  It is not subject to a filibuster. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2348.7s)]
*  However, there's a set of rules named after Robert bird. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2350.7999999999997s)]
*  A now long deceased former Democratic and former Dixie [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2357.7999999999997s)]
*  Craddock. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2362.9s)]
*  Senator from West Virginia and tell people about those those [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  bird rules and the process in which it gets it goes through [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2370.4s)]
*  what they call the birdbath. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2374.1s)]
*  So this is a budget reconciliation bill, right? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2375.2000000000003s)]
*  So in order to qualify for that special status where it gets [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2378.1s)]
*  it get it can be passed by 50 votes. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2383.2000000000003s)]
*  Everything has to have a primary budgetary purpose and it's [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2385.6s)]
*  not just that it has to have a budgetary purpose because if [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2389.9s)]
*  you cut $10 here, then that has a budgetary purpose that has [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2393.4s)]
*  to be the primary reason why it's in the bill. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2397.1s)]
*  It cannot be a policy that is sort of masquerading as a budget [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2402.1s)]
*  item and because you know, once this rule was established [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2405.9s)]
*  senators got more clever about trying to reach their policy [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2410.2s)]
*  goals through budgetary means and so the the Senate sort of [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2414.1s)]
*  arbiter the parliamentarian famed parliamentarian is the one [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2419.3s)]
*  who decides nope that actually you're trying to do policy [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2424.2s)]
*  there and that doesn't qualify under the 50 vote standard. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2427.7s)]
*  So we're going to kick that part out of the and the parties the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2431.2s)]
*  two different parties basically go to the parliamentarian file [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2433.7999999999997s)]
*  almost like what would this is weird. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2436.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they should put these on television the the the Democrats [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2438.2999999999997s)]
*  in this case the Democrats say I raise a point of order about [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2442.6s)]
*  this part of the bill and I say that this actually has a policy [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2446.6s)]
*  purpose and not a budgetary purpose and then there's a debate [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2450.5s)]
*  between the Democratic staff and the Republican staff with [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2453.7s)]
*  the parliamentarian present and the parliamentarian eventually [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  makes a ruling and that ruling is that this either gets to [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2460.4s)]
*  stay in the bill or this has to go and we actually got last [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  night some some early answers on some of this stuff with three [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2468.5s)]
*  of the you know, every committee in the Senate right has a [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2474.4s)]
*  different part of the bill three committees that have lesser [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2478.2s)]
*  parts of the bill. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2481.2s)]
*  They they got rulings and the biggest thing is a yet another [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2483.1s)]
*  kind of survival from a near-death experience for the [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2489.2s)]
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2493.2999999999997s)]
*  So in the bill there the way that the CFPB is structured is [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2495.6s)]
*  that they get their money from the Federal Reserve. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2501.1s)]
*  They don't get their money from the budget. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2503.2999999999997s)]
*  So the question is well, how do we ding the CFPB if it's not [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2505.7s)]
*  budgetary that they're not on the budget. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2509.8s)]
*  So what they did was they said, okay, we're going to put a cap [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2512.6000000000004s)]
*  on how much money the Fed can give the CFPB and that cap will [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2515.9s)]
*  be the 0% of the feds available resources. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2520.1000000000004s)]
*  In other words, we're going to zero out the budget of the [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2524.3s)]
*  CFPB. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2526.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, the Democrats challenged this and said you're just trying [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2527.7000000000003s)]
*  to kill the CFPB. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2529.9s)]
*  You're not trying to save money for the budget because it [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2531.0s)]
*  doesn't save money for the budget not directly and the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2533.8s)]
*  parliamentarian agreed with the Democrats and they kicked that [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2536.8s)]
*  part out of the bill. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2540.0s)]
*  So the CFPB will still get its current compliment. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2541.5s)]
*  There is actually a cap on CFPB resources and it's like 8% of [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2545.2000000000003s)]
*  what the Fed has. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2551.5s)]
*  I forget the exact numbers like 600 billion dollars or something [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2552.2000000000003s)]
*  or I'm sorry, 600 million dollars. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2555.0s)]
*  But anyway, so that's out of the bill and to be clear Congress [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2558.4s)]
*  can pass whatever it wants to. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2564.7s)]
*  It's just about having the special rules special rules that [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2567.2s)]
*  allow you to avoid the filibuster. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2570.3999999999996s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2572.0s)]
*  And there are a couple there. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2572.5s)]
*  I mean a couple there there are tens of these provisions at [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2573.8999999999996s)]
*  least right within the so this is an example. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2578.7999999999997s)]
*  There was an artificial intelligence ban. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2582.6s)]
*  There's a whole array of there's another one that got thrown [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2586.0s)]
*  out last night, which was the Republicans tried to repeal the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2590.2999999999997s)]
*  cafe standards for cars, which is an emissions standard tailpipe [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2596.6s)]
*  emissions for cars and say, you know cars have to have an average [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2601.8999999999996s)]
*  miles per gallon of 35 by X year. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2606.6s)]
*  They tried to repeal that and say that would save money and the [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2611.2999999999997s)]
*  parliamentarian said no, that's you're trying to create policy [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2615.1s)]
*  and that were thrown out. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2617.7999999999997s)]
*  The parliamentarian was sidestepped essentially when they [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2619.3s)]
*  essentially use the the Congressional Review Act in a sort [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2623.6000000000004s)]
*  of a misappropriated way, but let's not think this is a key [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2630.9s)]
*  point, right? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2633.2000000000003s)]
*  Because this is the first time things have been kicked out of [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2634.0s)]
*  the bill and John Thune is the Senate majority leader has said [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2636.2000000000003s)]
*  we're going to abide by the parliamentarian. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2641.7000000000003s)]
*  However, as you just said, they sidestepped the parliamentarian [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2644.2000000000003s)]
*  in one previous week ago, just a few weeks ago on the also bill. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2648.6s)]
*  They also did it for this bill when they were doing the budget [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2652.4s)]
*  resolution and now we're going to get into real one. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2656.0s)]
*  This is getting into very wonky stuff, but this is very important [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2659.7999999999997s)]
*  because we're talking about the baseline right of how we approach [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2663.0s)]
*  the tax cuts that are set to expire right and before we get to [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2668.5s)]
*  that, let's let's explain this other dynamic that exists with [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2675.0s)]
*  the bird rule, which is it needs to be deficit neutral 10 years [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2678.8s)]
*  out from the from the bill, right? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2683.5s)]
*  Basically, it cannot create deficits after the 10-year budget [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2686.3s)]
*  window. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2690.6s)]
*  Everything has to pencil out after that first 10 years. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2691.3s)]
*  You can you can have it spend money or or you know be a deficit [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2695.2000000000003s)]
*  in those first 10 years, but after that it has to be neutral, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2701.1s)]
*  which is why very often what we get is tax cuts that will expire [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2704.1s)]
*  right in 10 years, which is which is what happened in the Trump [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2709.9s)]
*  tax cuts of 2017. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2715.4s)]
*  The Trump tax cuts of 2017 actually expire at the end of this [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2717.7999999999997s)]
*  year and that was to make it look cheaper and also to part pencil [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2721.2999999999997s)]
*  out the budget neutrality outside the budget window and but when [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2726.5s)]
*  we talk about baseline, right even though these tax cuts must [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2731.9s)]
*  expire right so there's a current you have their very existence. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2736.9s)]
*  They could not exist if they if they weren't to expire at the [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2742.6s)]
*  end of this year. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2745.6s)]
*  However, there's some so the way it goes is there are two baselines [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2747.1s)]
*  you could use. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2751.4s)]
*  There's a current law baseline and the current policy baseline. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2752.0s)]
*  The current law baseline is what is the law say and the law says [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2755.5s)]
*  that these tax cuts expire in 2025 and therefore if you extend them [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2758.9s)]
*  it will cost the amount of the tax cuts in 2026 and 27 and 28 [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2763.7000000000003s)]
*  and 29 and so on if you use the current policy baseline the current [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2769.5s)]
*  policy is these tax cuts are in place. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2773.6000000000004s)]
*  So if they just stay in place that doesn't cost any money because [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2776.0s)]
*  it's just the same budget baseline as we have this year and this [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2780.4s)]
*  is a really key point because of the rules of not just the rules [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2785.4s)]
*  of budget risk reconciliation, but also what it looks like to [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2790.6s)]
*  the public does it look like these things cost 3 trillion dollars [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2794.2000000000003s)]
*  or does it look like it's the difference between that and the [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2798.6s)]
*  bill looking like it saves money over the next 10 years, right. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2801.9s)]
*  So the the Senate is really really interested in doing a current [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2806.0s)]
*  policy baseline the Republicans the Republicans. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2812.4s)]
*  And the Democrats have said well that violates any standard because [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2815.4s)]
*  you could just pass a reconciliation bill saying Medicare for all, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2821.3s)]
*  but we're only doing it for one year and then the next year pass [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2826.0s)]
*  a reconciliation bill that says Medicare for all permanently and [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2829.8s)]
*  that doesn't cost any money because it's current policy, right? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2833.1s)]
*  So is that really what you want to go for Republicans? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2838.1s)]
*  So when Senate Republicans came up against this on the budget [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2841.9s)]
*  resolution, which kind of sets the terms for the reconciliation [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2847.5s)]
*  bill, they said well, we don't need to ask the parliamentarian [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2851.3s)]
*  about that and they just ignored the parliamentarian didn't even [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2854.5s)]
*  ask her and they left it up to Lindsey Graham who is the left [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2857.5s)]
*  it up to the budget chair who is Lindsey Graham and he said yeah, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2861.3s)]
*  sure. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2864.1s)]
*  We'll do current policy baseline. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2864.5s)]
*  Now we're in a position with the bill itself where Democrats are [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2866.4s)]
*  going to challenge that and they're going to have the same debate [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2871.0s)]
*  in front of the parliamentarian this time and I think you know, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2873.8s)]
*  I think some of these other things like CFPB or cafe rules [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2877.4s)]
*  Senate Republicans will maybe probably not pick a fight over [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2882.0s)]
*  that. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2885.7s)]
*  But if the parliamentarian says that the current policy baseline [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2886.3s)]
*  is out, this is the big this is that's the biggest fight. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2889.8s)]
*  That's the biggest fight and there may be a situation where [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2893.0s)]
*  they ignore the ruling of the chair which they have the ability [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2897.0s)]
*  to do and then there's food and promise they wouldn't do it [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2900.1s)]
*  promised but you know, that's we're going to see the rubber [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2903.0s)]
*  hit the road. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2906.7999999999997s)]
*  Once that's the big one. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2907.5s)]
*  I mean because like the AI regulations that could drop out [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2909.0s)]
*  that we already have people drop out. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2913.9s)]
*  I don't have a problem people in the house who already say I [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2915.4s)]
*  regret voting for the bill with that big tech is lobbying furiously [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2917.7s)]
*  for that because it would ban all state regulations of artificial [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2922.2999999999997s)]
*  intelligence for the next 10 years and that includes a whole [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2926.1s)]
*  host of products because AI is is in everything now suppose not [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2929.1s)]
*  that and not only that but it's defined very broadly in the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2933.5s)]
*  right bill. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2935.7s)]
*  So it could be, you know, real page uses an algorithm to decide, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2936.4s)]
*  you know make its recommendations on how landlords can jack up [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2940.9s)]
*  rents that could be considered AI and so states and cities [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2944.9s)]
*  cannot do regulations on real page. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2949.1s)]
*  It has a huge implication set of implications and so those [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2951.3s)]
*  smaller things they may drop out. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2956.1s)]
*  We're going to we're going to start seeing this in this stuff [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2957.6s)]
*  is so Byzantine that you know outside of like a couple of [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2960.2s)]
*  small podcasts. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2963.9s)]
*  Frankly people are not aware of this big one being though that [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2965.2s)]
*  what is the baseline what what are we going to determine the [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2970.7s)]
*  cuts in and you know the argument that I saw Stephen [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2973.6s)]
*  Miller make I think it was on some banning she knows on with [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2978.9s)]
*  Kudlow if you could believe it was you know, there's no reason [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2984.2s)]
*  to expect that taxes are going to be any different tomorrow [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2991.1s)]
*  than they were today, which of course is like what are you [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2993.4s)]
*  talking about this entire this entire bill this tax regime was [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=2996.5s)]
*  different than it was the day before you passed it that they [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3000.4s)]
*  if you extend this out you just extend this logic out there was [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3004.6s)]
*  a billboard on Fox News that said that this bill saved 8 [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3008.2999999999997s)]
*  trillion dollars. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3012.0s)]
*  And the way they got that is they said current policy baseline [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3013.7s)]
*  that's zero dollars, but also look at all the economic growth [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3017.0s)]
*  that this is going to spur if you extend the tax cut that's [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3022.3s)]
*  the last which cost zero dollars right. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3025.3s)]
*  They said oh that's 3 trillion dollars that's going to so so [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3028.3s)]
*  that saves the government or adds revenue of 3 trillion dollars [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3032.1s)]
*  the government and then they said but also look at all the [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3035.4s)]
*  money. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3037.9s)]
*  We're collecting from tariffs which isn't in the bill at all, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3038.1s)]
*  but they said that's another 3 trillion dollars and and so [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3041.4s)]
*  they put this thing together and it literally said that that [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3045.4s)]
*  this bill saves 8 trillion dollars. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3048.4s)]
*  I don't understand why they even bother to like to grab [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3050.8s)]
*  why not just put out a number and just instead of like trying [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3055.6000000000004s)]
*  to have to reverse engineer where you're getting these [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3059.7000000000003s)]
*  figures for them to literally just numbers floating in the [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3062.6000000000004s)]
*  air and they just shove them in there and they're meaningless. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3065.3s)]
*  It feels like we don't have a media broadly speaking that [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3068.6s)]
*  has the ability to push back on the sort of a completely fake [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3072.8s)]
*  narratives that exist. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3076.3s)]
*  All right, let's turn to one other thing that I know you've [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3078.5s)]
*  been following the genius act. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3081.1s)]
*  I feel like this is like you say within two weeks. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3083.9s)]
*  It feels like we made both unlearn the lessons of the Iraq [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3090.4s)]
*  war and of the financial crisis. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3093.8s)]

*  essentially the Clinton administration sign off on the [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3101.6000000000004s)]
*  repeal of Glass-Steagall, but almost I mean, I think close [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3104.6000000000004s)]
*  worse. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3108.5s)]
*  Yeah, it almost feels worse because it feels like this [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3109.4s)]
*  crypto stuff. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3114.3s)]

*  five years 10 years 15 years don't know when but look, I [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3131.2000000000003s)]

*  structure bill which would basically strip the SEC [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3263.5s)]
*  securities and Exchange Commission of regulation of a [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3267.4s)]
*  lot of digital coins and give it to the commodity futures [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3269.8s)]
*  trading Commission, which is smaller and also friendlier [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3273.8s)]
*  to crypto right. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3277.4s)]
*  So, you know, there's still work to be done and it remains [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3279.0s)]
*  to be seen but the Senate passed the genius act this week [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3281.7s)]
*  with I believe 18 Democrats that were in support along [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3284.7s)]
*  with pretty much every Republican and that of course is [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3289.3s)]
*  because I mean almost explicitly because of the enormous [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3292.6s)]
*  crypto money, but it feels like I mean broadly speaking what [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3297.4s)]
*  it feels like we have now is essentially like the problem [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3300.9s)]
*  we had with shadow banking except for it's really just [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3305.9s)]
*  creating a whole new class of banks. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3309.2999999999997s)]
*  But without any of the capital requirements essentially of [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3313.2s)]
*  actual banks and I guess presumably allowing for all [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3318.2s)]
*  sorts of other derivatives and financial products that would [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3324.1s)]
*  come out of it on the back end and could theoretically be [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3327.0s)]
*  traded like you could have secondary tertiary markets trading [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3330.6s)]
*  on the Walmart dollar, whatever they call it, you know, the [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3335.6s)]
*  the first of all, I'm so excited to have to go to every [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3339.6s)]
*  different place of business that I buy things at with a [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3343.2s)]
*  different kind of money. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3346.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's sort of like this. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3347.9s)]
*  It's like, you know, it is as if you know, I remember in [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3349.3s)]
*  college going to Jamaica for spring break, right? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3356.0s)]
*  There were riots in Kingston at that time. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3361.2000000000003s)]
*  So it was very very inexpensive, but the the the hotel [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3364.2000000000003s)]
*  we say that you couldn't buy anything with cash. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3368.6s)]
*  It all had to be these like plastic beads and you would [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3371.5s)]
*  buy all these plastics you wear it around your neck and then [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3374.6s)]
*  you would just pull it off to buy like, you know, one punch [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3377.1s)]
*  and then it's like it's a hop skip and a jump to workers [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3379.7s)]
*  at Walmart being paid in these of course in that and now [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3382.9s)]
*  it's like I couldn't take that anywhere else. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3386.1s)]
*  Yeah, and the real problem is is that these companies are [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3388.6s)]
*  so massive and they're dealing they have their own essentially [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3393.0s)]
*  economies. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3396.5s)]
*  It could be backed by nothing and could fall apart at any [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3398.4s)]
*  point because they could just what we've seen with the stable [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3401.5s)]
*  coins that exist now is that there was one point a couple [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3403.9s)]
*  of years ago where every single one of the major stable coins [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3407.5s)]
*  was under investigation by the federal government for precisely [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3410.7000000000003s)]
*  that reason not having enough disclosure of what they were [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3415.0s)]
*  actually backed by and you know, a lot of those investigations [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3419.3s)]
*  have been canceled out by the Trump administration, right? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3423.4s)]
*  Who's or whose private organization has its own stable [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3426.7000000000003s)]
*  coin USD one that's part of World Liberty Financial, which [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3430.4s)]
*  is part of the Trump organization and yet this level [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3433.9s)]
*  of corruption that we're seeing with Trump's forays into [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3437.8s)]
*  crypto did not move almost a single Democrat to head off [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3442.0s)]
*  this bill and then you had I think maybe the funniest part [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3447.3s)]
*  of this Adam Schiff the senator from California saying I am [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3450.9s)]
*  introducing a bill to block Donald Trump from introducing [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3456.2999999999997s)]
*  a stable coin and he did it after voting to pass the genius [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3461.5s)]
*  act. He did not make it a condition of his vote. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3466.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm really shocked to hear that. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3470.2999999999997s)]
*  So, I mean what will happen to vanilla banks at that point [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3472.6s)]
*  like what's the point of them that seems to me they'll just [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3477.5s)]
*  move their operations into like they'll just the bank will [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3480.2999999999997s)]
*  exist over here is this sort of some type of like side project [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3485.1s)]
*  and their main business would be to be the sort of like unfettered [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3489.2s)]
*  by regulation. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3493.7s)]
*  But one of the amazing things in my view is how community [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3494.6s)]
*  banks did exceedingly little to try to fight back against [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3499.6s)]
*  this bill. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3503.9s)]
*  There were some community bankers in a couple states, Texas, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3504.6s)]
*  Illinois that actually oppose the bill and worked, you know [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3507.5s)]
*  to lobby Congress against it, but the national group the [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3511.5s)]
*  independent Community Bankers Association did nothing on this. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3515.0s)]
*  Do you think they just didn't and weren't aware of the implications? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3518.8s)]
*  No, I think they were fully aware of the implications, but they [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3521.6s)]
*  took a dive and you know, often the national ICBA is aligned [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3525.5s)]
*  with the big banks and the big banks don't have a problem with [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3531.1s)]
*  this because they can you know use they can issue their own [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3534.1s)]
*  stable coins and use their big enough that they yeah, they [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3537.4s)]
*  can they're going to just do a rival play. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3540.4s)]
*  They can profit off of trading from this. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3542.6s)]
*  The the independent banks are really endangered species right [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3545.6s)]
*  now the community banks because of you know, what might happen [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3550.0s)]
*  if this bill passes crazy. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3554.6s)]
*  What's what's going to before I go? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3558.2s)]
*  What's your call? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3560.7s)]
*  What's your gut feel here on New York City Mayors race? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3561.5s)]
*  I am going to check the weather and tell you I just saw some [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3564.6s)]
*  I guess it was maybe over the past day or two. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3572.6s)]
*  The early voting numbers look great from Ron Donnie and that's [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3577.0s)]
*  because of where they're coming from because where they're [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3581.7999999999997s)]
*  coming from they're coming from Brooklyn and Manhattan his [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3583.9s)]
*  weakest borrows are like the Bronx and [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3588.0s)]
*  this is off the top of my head but in Brooklyn, it's like a [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3593.6s)]
*  hundred and thirty-two percent more. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3598.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3601.5s)]
*  All the businesses have Zoran posters. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3603.5s)]
*  It is it's crazy in Manhattan also a hundred thirty-two [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3606.0s)]
*  percent or something like that could just be pulling forward [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3610.7s)]
*  votes. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3613.6s)]
*  You know, there's a finite amount that is correct, which is [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3614.7999999999997s)]
*  why I just checked the weather right on Monday. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3617.6s)]
*  It's going to be in the high 90s on Tuesday. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3621.1s)]
*  It's going to be 100 degrees at 2 p.m. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3624.6s)]
*  Yeah, and my sense is that if we look at enthusiasm banking [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3627.2s)]
*  those votes is important in banking those votes are important [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3638.1s)]
*  particularly for Cuomo, right because I do not have an older [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3641.0s)]
*  electorate that might not come out in a hundred degree. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3645.6s)]
*  Well, and I just think that the support for Cuomo is not as [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3648.0s)]
*  intense. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3652.5s)]
*  It may be larger, but it may not be but it's not as a deep [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3653.2999999999997s)]
*  and when you have an obstacle to voting. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3656.8s)]
*  This is the sort of the classic thing, right? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3659.3s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3662.0s)]
*  I mean, you know seeing that Marist poll that came out that [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3662.8s)]
*  had a kind of at a 10-point race met very much in line with [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3665.5s)]
*  Cuomo's internal polling. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3668.5s)]
*  It seems to me that there is a larger electorate for for Cuomo [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3671.5s)]
*  at the moment. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3674.9s)]
*  I think although that gap is shrinking. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3675.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that gap is shrinking but I also think that like look, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3677.5s)]
*  you know, I don't know how many of these voting places when [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3680.7000000000003s)]
*  there's a line if it's not out the door. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3684.2000000000003s)]
*  And I don't know how degree weather in a hundred degree [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3686.5s)]
*  weather, right, you know, I've met one Cuomo canvasser. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3688.9s)]
*  Just this is a completely anecdotal story. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3694.3s)]
*  I grab the hand to me the thing. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3698.1s)]
*  I walked like a half a block and I'm like, I wonder and I [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3701.5s)]
*  went back and I'm like, what is it you like about Cuomo and [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3704.4s)]
*  the guy was like, I like getting paid. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3707.1s)]
*  I like the check that he is every way. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3713.0s)]
*  And then so I went back up to where I was going and then walk [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3714.8s)]
*  back. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3717.7000000000003s)]
*  He was gone already one and one thing. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3717.9s)]
*  It's interesting is I just got to the area just yesterday, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3720.1000000000004s)]

*  It's not true. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3730.0s)]
*  Cuomo is pretty staggering. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3730.6000000000004s)]
*  In fact, Zoran today went to the City Board of Elections said [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3732.8s)]
*  you have to raise the cap because the super PAC money that [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3736.8s)]
*  Cuomo is getting is something like 24 million dollars. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3740.5s)]
*  So you have to allow me to spend more money above the cap [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3743.0s)]
*  because of all of these super PAC resources that are coming [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3746.4s)]
*  in. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3749.2s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder I wonder in a new in a in a primary, you know, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3749.3s)]
*  in 95 degree weather how much cable television ads impact [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3754.5s)]
*  the election. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3762.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't what about that globalizing into father controversy. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3764.2s)]
*  I just don't think that I just don't think that's going to be [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3768.4s)]
*  as I think that was already locked in. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3771.5s)]
*  You mean the people who are going to vote against Mondomi for [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3775.0s)]
*  that reason already were going to have already going to vote [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3777.5s)]
*  against them. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3780.3s)]
*  And if anything like, you know, so I think like the lander [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3780.9s)]
*  cross endorsement gives a permission structure for people [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3785.2s)]
*  who might have been on the on the fence. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3788.6s)]
*  I mean, I think it's really going to come down to going live [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3791.3s)]
*  on Tuesday. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3794.1s)]
*  Well, we go live every day at on election night. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3795.3s)]
*  Oh, that's a good idea. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3798.5s)]
*  I may I have your ideas. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3800.1s)]
*  I'm the one coming up with these things for you. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3803.0s)]
*  I mean, it's you know, it's I play softball on Tuesday night. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3805.2999999999997s)]
*  But maybe I don't want to block your softball, but maybe maybe [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3810.9s)]
*  I will do that live from my softball game. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3814.2999999999997s)]
*  There you go. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3817.6s)]
*  The dugout exactly checking Twitter for the the but I think [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3818.7999999999997s)]
*  it's really just a question of who turns out and I think [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3823.6s)]
*  that's a much harder as good as these these polls are. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3826.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3831.0s)]
*  And I think like in the Marist is I think is very reputable [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3831.7000000000003s)]
*  pollster. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3833.7000000000003s)]
*  I think it's very very difficult to assess who's going to come [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3834.9s)]
*  out. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3837.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3837.9s)]
*  You look at like the last primary like five people came [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3838.2000000000003s)]
*  out to vote for that in the Adam the Adams Garcia race. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3841.6s)]
*  Yes, this is going to have much higher turnout than that. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3846.9s)]
*  I mean, well, that's what I'm saying. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3849.8s)]
*  I think I'm more engaged. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3850.8s)]
*  I think it's going to be I think it's conceivable. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3851.8s)]
*  Could be 50% higher maybe more and there's also a lot more [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3854.6s)]
*  sophistication about ranked-choice voting that did not exist [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3861.6s)]
*  that time. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3865.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3866.4s)]
*  And so I think it's just right because that was the first one. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3866.7999999999997s)]
*  So you think like the the escalation in terms of knowledge [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3870.6s)]
*  and engagement from one to the first race to the second race [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3874.6s)]
*  is pretty exponential. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3877.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3878.4s)]
*  And so this is it's also interesting. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3879.1s)]
*  Matt's putting this up here. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3883.0s)]
*  Let's just go through this. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3884.3s)]
*  Bill de Blasio who I think never ever ever got enough credit [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3887.1000000000004s)]
*  for nor did he do himself any favors until he seemed like [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3893.6000000000004s)]
*  never to talk about it, right? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3897.9s)]
*  But this his universal pre-k which he fought tooth and nail [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3899.4s)]
*  with Cuomo over. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3904.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Cuomo had basically tried to put a poison [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3905.5s)]
*  pill in there would kill it at one point, but it was so amazingly [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3908.6000000000004s)]
*  popular and Cuomo got significantly weaker after just happenstance [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3911.6s)]
*  after this fight with Bill de Blasio. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3916.7s)]
*  The pre-k and 3k. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3921.1s)]
*  3k mean three-year-olds going. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3925.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3926.7999999999997s)]
*  It means the last two years prior to kindergarten, right? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3928.7999999999997s)]
*  Are universal are paid right and you know by the city essentially [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3933.9s)]
*  and it is huge. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3940.8s)]
*  It is so massive and I think we're not for covid. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3943.0s)]
*  We would see huge gains in in education achievement. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3948.5s)]
*  So right. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3954.5s)]
*  I don't know that's a we'll see Andrew Cuomo fought tooth and [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3956.4s)]
*  nail against that David day in I know you get to lunch. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0E8SHo9uY&t=3960.6s)]
