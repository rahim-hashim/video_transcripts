# Charlie Kirk Really Loves Being Humiliated By British People
**The Majority Report - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY)
*  Charlie Kirk, we played a clip of Charlie Kirk last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=0.0s)]
*  He visited Cambridge. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=3.5s)]
*  In the UK, I think there's some type of exchange program [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=7.04s)]
*  where you can have yourself humiliated by [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=10.34s)]
*  university students in Cambridge and Charlie signed up for it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=13.68s)]
*  I think they cover the cost of your flight, and that's probably why I did it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=17.98s)]
*  He wanted to see the English countryside. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=22.72s)]
*  And the only cost was that he would get repeatedly humiliated [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=27.380000000000003s)]
*  on the Internet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=32.72s)]
*  I think it's a new program Cambridge has trying to launch some of their students [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=33.42s)]
*  into the influencer category by letting them dunk repeatedly on sort of conservatives. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=36.72s)]
*  And so on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=41.1s)]
*  I can't remember what day it was last week. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=43.3s)]
*  We played. What was the name of the woman? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=45.8s)]
*  It was a Tilly at Blonde Praxis on TikTok. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  And she was exceptional. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  She really embarrassed Charlie Kirk. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=52.5s)]
*  Across the board in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=57.28s)]
*  Charlie Kirk's attempt to impose his [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  fundamentalist vision of how women should be essentially in the kitchen, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=64.92s)]
*  in in society. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=70.72s)]
*  Pregnant. And how would it make them happier? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=72.36s)]
*  It would make them happier. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=74.46000000000001s)]
*  He Charlie knows how to make all women happier. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=76.1s)]
*  He was using the smile to population ratio, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=79.7s)]
*  the very scientific formulation to compare us to nations in the continent of Africa. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=83.61999999999999s)]
*  And was sort of spiraling as he was trying to determine whether Rwanda was Muslim or not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  before he knew how to attack it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=93.0s)]
*  He is. He tried the Islamophobia, but she was a little too prepared. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Which one is this? Is this the. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=99.44s)]
*  OK, here is where Charlie wades into foreign policy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  with one of these Cambridge students. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=106.58s)]
*  Good evening, Mr. Kirk. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=113.6s)]
*  You've obviously devoted a lot of your life to electing, keeping in power [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump, and you did so partly because you said Trump would put Americans first [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=123.66s)]
*  and take them out of foreign conflicts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=127.6s)]
*  Should we see how that is going at the moment? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=129.24s)]
*  Currently, Trump has just accepted a 400 million dollar debt from Qatar, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=132.2s)]
*  which we're assured is perfectly above board. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  Billions in arms are going to Saudi Arabia, which they're using to bomb [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  and starve Yemeni children. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=141.84s)]
*  Not sure how that's in the interest of the United States, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=143.34s)]
*  but it might be in the interest of the five and a half billion dollar deal [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=145.5s)]
*  his failed sons are receiving. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=149.38s)]
*  At the same time, this great president of peace has greenlit mass killings, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=151.18s)]
*  not just in Yemen, but in Gaza, where he greenlit an invasion [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  called Operation Gideon's Chariot with the express aim of wiping out [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=158.78s)]
*  the Gaza population. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=162.56s)]
*  You promised to put America first. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=164.06s)]
*  Haven't you and your ilk sold America out? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=165.6s)]
*  No. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=171.82s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you have great intellectual substance. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=172.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=175.82s)]
*  It's all the culture wars for you, isn't it? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=176.82s)]
*  The second someone actually tells you what you're doing, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=179.82s)]
*  would you just read? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=182.82s)]
*  Can you calm down a little bit? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=183.82s)]
*  Like, just a little bit. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=184.82s)]
*  You're pounding the table, you're all over the place. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=185.82s)]
*  No. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=188.82s)]
*  You want me to go piece by piece, or would you like me to talk slower? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=189.82s)]
*  I think you can... [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=193.82s)]
*  Number one. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=194.82s)]
*  I'm not going to say that you're going to be the first to talk about it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=195.82s)]
*  I'm going to say he said no and put the mic down. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=198.82s)]
*  Like, this is exactly no. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=203.82s)]
*  This is this is listen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=205.82s)]
*  Charlie Kirk has been on the road and all he's been doing is been doing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=207.82s)]
*  these these type of like back and forth with with college students. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=212.82s)]
*  Now, the college students here in Cambridge are prepared. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=217.82s)]
*  They're not like showing up on the quad and realizing like, hey, man, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=222.82s)]
*  Charlie Kirk is down there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=227.82s)]
*  Let's go question him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=228.82s)]
*  I got lunch at one thirty. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=229.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, understand. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=231.82s)]
*  And I know this from my my performance days. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=233.82s)]
*  If you if you're on the road as a comedian, your crowd work improves. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=235.82s)]
*  So Charlie immediately has to go to this type of a crowd work now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=242.82s)]
*  because he's embarrassed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=249.82s)]
*  He's not prepared for this level of actually substantive exchange. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=253.82s)]
*  And I will tell you, like, if you have been through, if you're going through [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=258.82s)]
*  like a tour, you know, let's say you're doing a book tour and you're talking [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=264.82s)]
*  about your book, I mean, we, you know, we have people come through here all the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=268.82s)]
*  time when they are practiced. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=271.82s)]
*  They are much smoother. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=273.82s)]
*  They have all these answers that are sort of like, you know, somewhat formulaic. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=274.82s)]
*  They're prepared to answer them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=279.82s)]
*  And it shows. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=281.82s)]
*  And Kirk is perfectly sort of like situated to look at you bouncing around. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=284.82s)]
*  You're too excited. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=292.82s)]
*  You're getting too emotional. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=293.82s)]
*  He's this is what Tim Pool also fell back. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=294.82s)]
*  He's stalling. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=297.82s)]
*  He's stalling because he's not ready to answer the question. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=298.82s)]
*  And also, you're the one with the emotional response who went if like to an ad hominem [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=301.82s)]
*  or not maybe an ad hominem, but you were. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=306.82s)]
*  You're jumping around. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=308.82s)]
*  You're banging on the table. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=309.82s)]
*  He's moving. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=310.82s)]
*  He doesn't have a ready. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=311.82s)]
*  He's ready made response. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=312.82s)]
*  And I want to make it clear. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=313.82s)]
*  I am perfectly in favor of mocking people and of mocking people to their face. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=314.82s)]
*  The problem that Charlie has here is that he has no substance. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=321.82s)]
*  So it's all sort of like smack talk, but no ability to shoot the jumper over the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=325.82s)]
*  defender or to take it into the hoop. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=331.82s)]
*  And he knows that he's all frosty. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=333.82s)]
*  No cake. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=336.82s)]
*  The problem he has here is that like even the conservatives in this audience, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=337.82s)]
*  they're anticipating Charlie being able to deliver the goods. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=343.82s)]
*  And Charlie's not able to do that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=347.82s)]
*  And time and time again, we've seen that there it's just not going over in the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=348.82s)]
*  same way. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=353.82s)]
*  But good. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=354.82s)]
*  Donald Trump is convening a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=355.82s)]
*  Joe Biden gave them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=357.82s)]
*  Well, isn't it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=358.82s)]
*  Can you not interrupt me? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=359.82s)]
*  I allowed you to talk uninterrupted. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=360.82s)]
*  You're famous for not interrupting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=362.82s)]
*  I haven't interrupted a single person here today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=365.82s)]
*  Can I speak uninterrupted actually? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=367.82s)]
*  He is convening a peace deal between Russia, Ukraine. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=369.82s)]
*  I believe we will see an end to that war. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=372.82s)]
*  I will tell you, I also think we're going to see an end to that war. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=374.82s)]
*  Because nothing can last forever. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=383.82s)]
*  But we're going to stop that so far. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=385.82s)]
*  Charlie, it doesn't seem to be working very well. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=389.82s)]
*  Good. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=392.82s)]
*  A peace deal between Russia, Ukraine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=393.82s)]
*  I believe we will see an end to that war. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=395.82s)]
*  Number two, he's actually talking to Iran and discouraging Israel to strike the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=397.82s)]
*  interior of Iran and has stopped many international. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=401.82s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=405.82s)]
*  Now, despite the fact that Donald Trump said on day one he was going to end the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=406.82s)]
*  Ukraine-Russia war, that was, you know, obviously hyperbole. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=411.82s)]
*  And it's very well maybe that he is able to stop the war, but he has shown no [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=418.82s)]
*  ability to do so any more than Joe Biden had an ability to do so. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=424.82s)]
*  In terms of Iran, it is true that he very well may come to forge a deal that is [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=428.82s)]
*  maybe as good as the one that he unilaterally killed eight years ago. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=437.82s)]
*  What did Charlie Kirk think about Obama's Iran deal? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=442.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=444.82s)]
*  The thing is, is that they were never making this argument at that time. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=445.82s)]
*  But now that Donald Trump wants to be the dealmaker, they have to fit their [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=448.82s)]
*  arguments to his sensibilities. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=452.82s)]
*  The entire Republican Party has been foaming at the mouth for war with Iran my [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=454.82s)]
*  entire lifetime. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=459.82s)]
*  Also, they haven't signed a new deal yet. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=460.82s)]
*  I mean, it is. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=462.82s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=463.82s)]
*  And to be clear, this is like me touting the fact that I have saved multiple [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=464.82s)]
*  lives by not killing them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=469.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=471.82s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=472.82s)]
*  Number three, can you give him credit for ending the Indian-Pakistan war? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=473.82s)]
*  Both of them said he didn't do that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=478.82s)]
*  Well, hold on a second. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=480.82s)]
*  Let's go back. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=481.82s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=482.82s)]
*  Russia, Ukraine. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=483.82s)]
*  Can I speak now? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=484.82s)]
*  Yes, but the Indian-Pakistan thing, you've got to go deeper than that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=485.82s)]
*  Let's go in order. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=488.82s)]
*  Is a peace summit where the main person in question, Russia, doesn't show up, is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=490.82s)]
*  that a success, Mr. Kirk? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=495.82s)]
*  I'm not even sure. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=497.82s)]
*  Is that a success? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=499.82s)]
*  Well, again, these are ongoing negotiations and it's a lot better than when your [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=500.82s)]
*  prime minister, Boris Johnson, went alongside our secretary of state, Tony Blinken, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=505.82s)]
*  to Istanbul and unnecessarily blew up a potential Russian peace deal. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=509.82s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=513.8199999999999s)]
*  Which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead Ukrainians. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=514.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to think of what American politician supported Boris Johnson. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  Wasn't Donald Trump giving him a big endorsement? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he did. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  Am I mistaking that? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=527.8199999999999s)]
*  Also, Trump armed Ukraine. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=529.82s)]
*  The only problem he had with Ukraine was... [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=530.82s)]
*  They didn't screw over Joe Biden. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=532.82s)]
*  We could have made this much simpler. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=538.82s)]
*  ...one of the great unnecessary wars of the modern era. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=541.82s)]
*  Donald Trump believes in conversation and police boot through strength. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=544.82s)]
*  He has been president for well over 120 to 130 days and he has already ended a war [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=548.82s)]
*  between two nuclear conflicts of India-Pakistan. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=553.82s)]
*  He has secured our own US southern border while we were being invaded by foreign powers. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=556.82s)]
*  And thirdly, he is brokering a potential settlement with Iran that will prevent a major [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=560.82s)]
*  escalation in the Middle East. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=565.82s)]
*  And finally, it is very difficult, but I believe they'll get it done, that we'll [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=567.82s)]
*  finally see an end to the Russian-Ukrainian war. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=570.82s)]
*  No God. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=572.82s)]
*  I'm just going to disregard the enormous lies you just put out there about Russia and Ukraine. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=573.82s)]
*  But do you really think leverage negotiations work if you cut off all your leverage and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=578.82s)]
*  scream at one party in the Oval Office? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=582.82s)]
*  Don't you think that has just emboldened Russia? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=584.82s)]
*  Because look at the approach. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=586.82s)]
*  Putin thinks so much of your glorious president he can't even be asked to show up. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=587.82s)]
*  You have elected, or helped elect, somebody who is at best an idiot and at worst is deeply corrupt. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=591.82s)]
*  Okay, again, so Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call today. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=597.82s)]
*  You'll acknowledge that's a good thing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=600.82s)]
*  The pursuit of peace can sometimes be a winding road and it's a lot better than sending [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=602.82s)]
*  hundreds of billions in dollars further into the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=606.82s)]
*  something that tragically, both the UK government and the US government has been unnecessarily [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=610.82s)]
*  supporting for a couple of years. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=615.82s)]
*  President Trump wants to see a brokerage, an ending of this settlement. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=617.82s)]
*  I pray we can get it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=620.82s)]
*  It's very complicated because of the mess that Joe Biden left, which was an active kinetic [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=621.82s)]
*  war with a nuclear power sending American-made missiles into the interior of Russia. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=625.82s)]
*  So President Trump has already ended a war. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=630.82s)]
*  He's ended an invasion. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=632.82s)]
*  He's only 130 days into this. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=633.82s)]
*  And I believe, we do not know, at this point we are merely speculating, which I think we [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=635.82s)]
*  should not spend our time doing that, because eventually one of us will be right. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=638.82s)]
*  I believe we will be right and I believe we'll see an end to this war. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=642.82s)]
*  Can we just talk about a hundred billions worth of weapons? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=644.82s)]
*  Because you dodged my question on what was going on in the Middle East, where Trump has [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=646.82s)]
*  just signed enormous arms contracts with Saudi Arabia and with Qatar. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=650.82s)]
*  And I noticed you ignored the fact that this might have had anything to do with the blatant [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=655.82s)]
*  corruption going on through the Trump coin and going on through giving the very competent [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=660.82s)]
*  sons of Donald Trump billions of investment from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=665.82s)]
*  This is something that is directly embroiling Americans into conflict, but is importantly [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=669.82s)]
*  killing many innocent people. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=673.82s)]
*  Those nations have been known to terrorize innocent civilian populations. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=675.82s)]
*  So if you're coming to me and you're objecting to America selling weaponry, why are you [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=678.82s)]
*  defending, shilling for the Saudis? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=683.82s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=685.82s)]
*  One is sending weaponry. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=686.82s)]
*  One is purchasing. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=687.82s)]
*  Secondly, you do know that the biggest purchase that was announced... [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=688.82s)]
*  Oh, pause it for a second. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=690.82s)]
*  I got news for you. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=691.82s)]
*  You think that we're just giving Ukraine weapons like there isn't? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=694.82s)]
*  We're not. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=698.82s)]
*  We're not. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=699.82s)]
*  We aren't selling these weapons to Ukraine. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=700.82s)]
*  We're giving them money to buy from our own weapons manufacturers. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=703.82s)]
*  Self-dealing. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=709.82s)]
*  What is this? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=710.82s)]
*  What is that? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=711.82s)]
*  Like, what are we talking about? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=712.82s)]
*  How about Donald Trump reversing Biden's decision to halt the one thing that he did was say [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=713.82s)]
*  that Israel can't use 2,000 pound bombs on the 141 square foot, square mile Gaza strip [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=718.82s)]
*  killing children and families over and over again. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=725.82s)]
*  And almost immediately, Donald Trump reversed that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=728.82s)]
*  He's way more comfortable talking about Russia, Ukraine. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=731.82s)]
*  And I'll just say like Trump's approach of saying, I basically hate Ukraine and love Russia. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=733.82s)]
*  It hasn't really worked out the way that all of them have expected. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=738.82s)]
*  And Putin's just like, okay, I guess I don't need to do shit. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=741.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=743.82s)]
*  Well, airliner 737, a hundred billion dollars. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=744.82s)]
*  We've heard of Qatar Airways. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=747.82s)]
*  They purchase a hundred billion dollars of commercial airways. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=748.82s)]
*  You are right. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=751.82s)]
*  There were some weapons contracts. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=752.82s)]
*  But I guess the question is, would you rather have Saudi Arabia buy weapons from America [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=753.82s)]
*  or China rather than not have American weaponry? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=756.82s)]
*  That is so revealing. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=759.82s)]
*  That is so revealing. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=761.82s)]
*  We've talked about this over and over on the show about how our murderous, genocidal Middle [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=763.82s)]
*  East policy is much more about keeping China away from the Middle East than it is about [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=768.82s)]
*  even our footprint there because we have like this military footprint there and we're trying [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=775.82s)]
*  to and we're expanding that with Saudi Arabia and Qatar. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=780.82s)]
*  But he admitted it there. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=783.82s)]
*  Okay, we're helping commit genocide because we're using force while China is using soft [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=784.82s)]
*  power by say also China negotiated a negotiated or was it a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=789.82s)]
*  mediator between Iran and Saudi Arabia on Yemen and successfully much to the chagrin [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=798.82s)]
*  of the United States halted some of the worst of the starvation and horror in Yemen because [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=804.82s)]
*  of their talks with those two parties. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=810.82s)]
*  That's what they're concerned about. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=812.82s)]
*  So as China does that via negotiations or investment, the United States is trying to [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=813.82s)]
*  bomb everybody into oblivion and Charlie supporting that foreign policy while he's claiming it's [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=818.82s)]
*  anti-war because of great power rivalry. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=824.82s)]
*  I think for a second, okay, fine. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=827.82s)]
*  You mentioned Qatar. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=829.82s)]
*  You've been talking a lot about Hamas and the evils of the mess. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=830.82s)]
*  Can I ask you who's the main funder of mass? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=834.82s)]
*  Well, the Palisade. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=837.82s)]
*  Well, the West actually funds Hamas. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=839.82s)]
*  Which state? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=841.82s)]
*  Well, Iran funds. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=842.82s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=843.82s)]
*  Where are the Hamas leaders? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=844.82s)]
*  And also funds Hamas. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=845.82s)]
*  It is a combination of organizations. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=847.82s)]
*  100 million jet with the president United States. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=850.82s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=852.82s)]
*  First of all, it was not given to him personally. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=853.82s)]
*  I understand the optics optics of it, but it was not given to him personally. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=855.82s)]
*  It was given to the US government and under that standard, no US government should pause [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=858.82s)]
*  it for a second. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=862.82s)]
*  That is not my understanding. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=863.82s)]
*  It was on loan to the US government, but given to the Trump presidential library. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=865.82s)]
*  Got to load all these books up. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=870.82s)]
*  Yes, it's really just for the books and very well. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=873.82s)]
*  It's a lot of books. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=876.82s)]
*  We'll get to use it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=877.82s)]
*  It's a library. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=878.82s)]
*  My family will be able to use the Trump presidential library. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=879.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=883.82s)]
*  But a library in the sky. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=884.82s)]
*  A library in the sky. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=886.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=887.82s)]
*  Listen, just coincidence that while I'm president, the US government will get to use it. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=888.82s)]
*  And then while I'm not president, my library will get to use it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=892.82s)]
*  I think when I'm in government, the government can have it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=896.82s)]
*  It's from any foreign countries whatsoever. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=899.82s)]
*  It's not given to him personally and not a violation of the... [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=902.82s)]
*  Why is he trying to transfer it to his personal library? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=905.82s)]
*  He is. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=908.82s)]
*  Actually, okay. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=909.82s)]
*  He's sent out this. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=910.82s)]
*  We're lying. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=911.82s)]
*  I keep on going. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=912.82s)]
*  Way too in the weeds. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=913.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=914.82s)]
*  So under that fundamental moral principle then, can you acknowledge though that President [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=915.82s)]
*  Trump is getting more done in a less period of time than any president we've seen while [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=921.0600000000001s)]
*  our prior president did not even know what year he got elected? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=925.38s)]
*  Do you understand the contrast here? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=929.82s)]
*  What about him again? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=930.82s)]
*  I'm not a defender of Biden. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=931.82s)]
*  No, I'm not saying...President Trump is far better than the predecessor. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=932.82s)]
*  You have to defend the person you spent millions to. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=935.82s)]
*  I would just say Trump's mental fitness is not...it's pretty early in the administration [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=937.82s)]
*  to put all your eggs in that particular basket. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=941.82s)]
*  I would say so, but of course you see that Kirk has to change the subject. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=942.82s)]
*  You're getting too weedy when you talk about the details of actually where that plane was [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=947.82s)]
*  going. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=955.82s)]
*  Let's not get too specific here. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=956.82s)]
*  Let's keep... [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=957.82s)]
*  Anyway, Hunter Biden's laptop. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=958.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=959.82s)]
*  What about him, yeah? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=960.82s)]
*  ...even know what year he got elected. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=961.82s)]
*  Do you understand the contrast here? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=963.82s)]
*  What about him again? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=964.82s)]
*  I'm not a defender of Biden. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=965.82s)]
*  No, I'm not saying...President Trump is far better than the predecessor. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=966.82s)]
*  You have to defend the person you spent millions to. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=969.82s)]
*  I will defend every day of someone who ends an invasion. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=971.82s)]
*  That's all you do is... [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=974.82s)]
*  Brings down the price of oil. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=975.82s)]
*  The invasion being immigrants to this country. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=976.82s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=978.82s)]
*  Who is revitalizing the American economy, who is brokering peace, who stopped the potential [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=979.82s)]
*  nuclear war, who is bringing Iran to the table and bringing Russia to the table. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=984.82s)]
*  Someone who does not want armed conflicts with the greatest powers of our time. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=988.82s)]
*  I will defend that endlessly. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=992.82s)]
*  You are living in a fantasy world of your own creation. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=994.82s)]
*  So it's quite hard to engage with that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=998.82s)]
*  You can say that, but then disprove it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1000.82s)]
*  But let's check on how Trump is doing in terms of diplomacy. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1001.82s)]
*  Look, with the war in the Middle East, do you think it was a defensible decision to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1004.82s)]
*  tell the Israelis you wanted Trump-Gaza to agree for Israel to invade the Gaza Strip [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1009.82s)]
*  and to continue to murder thousands of innocent children and civilians in a pointless war? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1014.82s)]
*  Is that in America's interest? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1019.82s)]
*  Is that in humanity's interest? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1020.82s)]
*  Well, first of all, you should know something about Trump. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1021.82s)]
*  There's something, he's realized what Trump over the last 10 years. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1022.82s)]
*  He is quite the social media user and uses hyperbolic language at times. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1027.8200000000002s)]
*  In the conflict of Israel versus Hamas, who's the good guy? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1032.8200000000002s)]
*  I believe both Hamas and the Israeli government are evil, but I think also that there is no [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1036.8200000000002s)]
*  justification for the murder and mutilation of thousands of innocent people and children. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1041.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, let's hear him out. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1048.82s)]
*  There is no justification, Mr. Trump, for invading hospitals, for bombing innocent populations [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1051.82s)]
*  and dragging out a war which is damaging Israel and the West. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1058.82s)]
*  You've made that point, but it's not a point, it's a moral truth, isn't it? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1061.82s)]
*  It was also a moral truth that the war started because 1,300 Jews were killed and 200 were [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1065.82s)]
*  taken hostage. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1069.82s)]
*  And when you declare war on Israel, expect a firestorm in reaction. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1070.82s)]
*  Let me finish, I let you talk. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1074.82s)]
*  Israel is the holiest day of the calendar year besides Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1076.82s)]
*  the 50 year anniversary of the Six Day War. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1081.82s)]
*  On Shabbat, Hamas invaded Israel. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1084.82s)]
*  That's the holiest day in Israel? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1087.82s)]
*  It's the 50 year of... [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1089.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1091.82s)]
*  I didn't realize that that was a holy day. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1092.82s)]
*  I did not learn that in Hebrew school. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1095.82s)]
*  Oh, you didn't learn about the holy Six Day War day? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1098.82s)]
*  No, I mean, I learned about the Six Day War, but I didn't realize that was a holy day. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1100.82s)]
*  It's biblical. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1105.82s)]
*  Well, perhaps it is for Charlie because what's his religion? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1106.82s)]
*  I don't know if he subscribes to the idea that the end times are coming if more and [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1109.82s)]
*  more Jews go to Israel, but the more conflict that is in that region, the more that the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1113.82s)]
*  evangelicals get their biblical prophecy of most of the Jews burning up so that Jesus [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1118.82s)]
*  comes back. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1123.82s)]
*  You can see Kirk, though, now is like, is attempting to get morally righteous. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1124.82s)]
*  Now he understands, like, this is the way that he salvages to the extent that there [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1128.82s)]
*  are any Americans who are going to watch this. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1132.82s)]
*  This is the way he salvages it, at least for his own audience, is to wrap himself in the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1135.82s)]
*  cloak of it being something to do with anti-Semitism. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1141.82s)]
*  And they clipped this themselves, yeah. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1145.82s)]
*  Oh, did they? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1147.82s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1148.82s)]
*  That would explain it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1149.82s)]
*  All right, let's go on to another one because he, I mean, it's quite clear he was... [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1151.82s)]
*  Let's just get through this so I can see the response. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1155.82s)]
*  ... taken hostage. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1157.82s)]
*  And when you declare war on Israel, expect a firestorm in reaction. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1158.82s)]
*  Let me finish, I let you talk. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1163.82s)]
*  America first! [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1164.82s)]
*  Firestorm! [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1165.82s)]
*  It's the holiest day of the calendar year besides Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1166.82s)]
*  50-year anniversary of the Six-Day War. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1171.82s)]
*  On Shabbat, the most invaded Israel, deciding to go recklessly to music concerts, to homes, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1173.82s)]
*  to kibbutz, and taking 200-plus hostages. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1180.82s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1182.82s)]
*  In one of the most cloistered urban environments on the planet, two million people live in [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1184.82s)]
*  a place where it's impossible to wage war. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1188.82s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1190.82s)]
*  Oh, they found a way. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1191.82s)]
*  Where they wear civilian clothing, they violate every tenet of the Geneva Convention, and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1192.82s)]
*  the IDF, when they do something right, they get no credit. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1195.82s)]
*  When they do life-saving surgeries of a Gazan child, they get no credit. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1198.82s)]
*  When they drive leaflets, drop leaflets, they get no credit. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1201.82s)]
*  But when they happen to bomb a place where they are operating their military from, which [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1203.82s)]
*  we now know, from third-party verified sources, hundreds of Hamas military operations are [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1207.82s)]
*  in mosques, schools, and hospitals. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1212.82s)]
*  I'm sorry, the country where they were living in relative peace on October 6, that all of [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1214.82s)]
*  a sudden we had a war, and Hamas started the war. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1219.82s)]
*  And I don't see people that were really upset about the two million Germans that were killed [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1221.82s)]
*  in World War II, civilians. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1225.82s)]
*  A tragic truth of war is that civilians die. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1226.82s)]
*  I don't like it, and you don't like it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1229.82s)]
*  And they brought it upon themselves. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1231.82s)]
*  The only operation at M.T. to blame is the leadership of Hamas, not the Israeli government, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1233.82s)]
*  for fighting this defensive war after they were invaded. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1237.82s)]
*  I am no defender of the terrible pogrom that was launched against Jews on that day. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1240.82s)]
*  But the justification for the death of innocents cannot be an infinite cycle of bloodlust. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1248.82s)]
*  It cannot be killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians with a war with no end [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1253.82s)]
*  in sight, people who are not complicit in those atrocities. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1258.82s)]
*  It cannot be bombing hospitals which children use. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1261.82s)]
*  It cannot be bombing hospitals in which cancer patients are dying and starving in there. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1264.82s)]
*  The deaths that have been inflicted, nobody knows the true toll, but somewhere between [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1269.82s)]
*  50 and 100,000 people lie dead under the rubble. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1273.82s)]
*  And what is left for Gaza except for to continue to suffer under Hamas? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1277.82s)]
*  Because it turns out Netanyahu's political strategy has not worked. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1281.82s)]
*  I like this guy, but I wish that he responded to the reasoning that Charlie Kirk used, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1285.82s)]
*  which was that Gaza is so densely populated. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1294.82s)]
*  Why is it so densely populated? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1298.82s)]
*  Why does Hamas have to conduct its military operations in, again, that 141 square mile strip of land? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1300.82s)]
*  It's because Israel controls their borders, land and sea. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1310.82s)]
*  They have no air force, they have no airport, they have no passports in many instances. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1313.82s)]
*  If you leave the Gaza Strip, it's very difficult to get back and maybe see the rest of your family. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1318.82s)]
*  Israel won't let you back in. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1322.82s)]
*  It's because it's an open air concentration camp. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1324.82s)]
*  That's why they're conducting their military operations within the boundaries of the concentration camp that they live in. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1327.82s)]
*  The permanent refugee camp, yep. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1336.82s)]
*  Half of the population prior to the genocide was children, in part because of the circulating death [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1338.82s)]
*  that Israel would engender and create in that area. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1345.82s)]
*  And because they would do operations every single year called mowing the lawn, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1351.82s)]
*  where they would try to undercut Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip by bombing people indiscriminately prior to this. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1357.82s)]
*  So the idea that they were living in relative peace is a completely false notion. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1364.82s)]
*  So I like that guy. He did a lot of great stuff there, but I feel like that could have been stronger. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1368.82s)]
*  I want to make a point, and we have another clip on this, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1372.82s)]
*  but when Charlie Kirk says who are the good guys and who are the bad guys there, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1374.82s)]
*  there's this clip of Jake Tapper saying that students are seeing things only in terms of oppressor and oppressed. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1378.82s)]
*  And it's actually projection by Zionists, because I have an answer for where Hamas, the bad things from Hamas and Zionists come from. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1384.82s)]
*  It's from a settler colonial structure that inevitably produces this sort of hatred. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1391.82s)]
*  It's what produces feelings towards Native Americans in this country. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1394.82s)]
*  It is the structure. It has nothing to do with these religions. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1399.82s)]
*  These holy books have been around for thousands of years that haven't changed. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1401.82s)]
*  What changes these nationalisms? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1404.82s)]
*  And I just think it's ridiculous how infantile that gets when it's like who's the good guys, who's the bad guys that I'm not in a Marvel movie right now. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1406.82s)]
*  Well, they are when they perceive a certain kind of like Western or white. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1415.82s)]
*  Who's white, who's black? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1421.82s)]
*  That's what it is. Who's the savage and who is the Western first world, sophisticated society? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1422.82s)]
*  It's just clash of civilizations that they're grafting onto this. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1431.82s)]
*  Let's look at Jake Tapper. Was he on Bill Maher? He's on Bill Maher's show. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1436.82s)]
*  And go ahead, please. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1445.82s)]
*  It has to do with an academic theology of oppressor and oppressed. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1447.82s)]
*  Pause it for a second. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1453.82s)]
*  Did he just say an academic theology? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1455.82s)]
*  Of oppressor and oppressed? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1460.82s)]
*  Is he like an academic theology? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1462.82s)]
*  I think he's trying to say they're trying to undermine their thinking by saying it's a religion. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1468.82s)]
*  It's something like that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1475.82s)]
*  It's like culture. It's like, you know, when the kids wear their hats backwards or their pants saggy, it's like it's a trend that they accurately. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1476.82s)]
*  It's like a cult, he's saying. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1486.82s)]
*  Yeah, that they accurately recognize power in the world. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1488.82s)]
*  Okay, an academic theology. Go ahead. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1492.82s)]
*  It has to do with an academic theology of oppressor and oppressed. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1496.82s)]
*  If you only look at the world as oppressor versus oppressed, you then have to choose in a conflict, this group is the oppressor, this group is the oppressed. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1503.82s)]
*  It's also why, for example, there have been conflicts on other college campuses where gay students have protested things that are going on in Muslim countries having to do with the LGBTQ community in those countries. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1511.82s)]
*  And the gay students are made to be the oppressor because a lot of them are white. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1526.82s)]
*  And that's also what's going on when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1529.82s)]
*  I'm saying that Israelis are being made to be the oppressors because they're white in this instance. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1535.82s)]
*  It has nothing to do with the complete total asymmetry in the power of these two groups of people. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1542.82s)]
*  One being controlled by the other, one having all the weapons, one having all the resources, one having all the food, one having control of the electricity and the water. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1554.82s)]
*  It's just because the Israelis are white, according to Jake Tapper. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1566.82s)]
*  And that's what these pink, this is how he's dismissing the pink haired college kids. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1572.82s)]
*  I am curious if someone has an example of a Hamas leader or a Palestinian leader saying something equivalent to what Ehud Barak said in 1998, which is when he said, if I was a Palestinian at the right age and at some stage I would have entered the terror organizations and have fought from there. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1577.82s)]
*  And later certainly have tried to influence from within the political system. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1600.82s)]
*  But this is good for Jake because we really don't have enough of this in media. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1605.82s)]
*  We don't have enough of representation of the perspective that the Israelis are the victims. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1609.82s)]
*  This is Jake Tapper doing his Jerry Seinfeld. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1618.82s)]
*  The college students don't like my gay king joke anymore. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1620.82s)]
*  It's crazy, hopes us there. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1623.82s)]
*  And that's also what's going on when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1625.82s)]
*  The Israelis are made to be the oppressor, the Palestinians the oppressed, and on and on and on. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1641.82s)]
*  And that's part of what's going on at Harvard, that theology, that way of looking at the world. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1645.82s)]
*  First off, it's also I don't know why he keeps calling it theology. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1651.82s)]
*  But has this always been the case? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1656.82s)]
*  Has this always been the case that college students have always have college students always been taking this position? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1659.82s)]
*  Because I don't think it was the case 40 years ago. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1670.82s)]
*  I don't think it was the case 50 years ago. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1673.82s)]
*  I don't think it was the case even maybe even 30 years ago. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1677.82s)]
*  Somehow this theology evolved. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1681.82s)]
*  It's as if like God died or something and came back. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1686.82s)]
*  Or maybe it became clear what the dynamic is. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1690.82s)]
*  Can you imagine if he made this argument about like say South Africa? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1696.82s)]
*  The white South Africans are made to be the oppressors. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1701.82s)]
*  I can guarantee you absolutely did. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1705.82s)]
*  And the black South Africans the oppressed. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1707.82s)]
*  And then he made some sort of point about the lacking culture of black South Africans. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1709.82s)]
*  Maybe he would make a point about say crime rates or something like that to say how there's a hypocrisy involved there. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1716.82s)]
*  But you hear the race. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1723.82s)]
*  He went to the right show to make an Islamophobic racist argument. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1726.82s)]
*  This is when I remember watching Bill Maher's show and when I realized this was not the show for me was his rampant Islamophobia. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1730.82s)]
*  When I was getting interested in atheism and you saw how him and Sam Harris and that whole movement, they were atheists. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1739.82s)]
*  But they were also like somehow Zionists at the same time because they felt that the Israeli culture or Western society was more advanced. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1746.82s)]
*  And thus for you should be more sympathetic to that. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1755.82s)]
*  Islam was the mother load of bad ideas. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1758.82s)]
*  They used to my favorite thing about Sam Harris is is that when he first started doing his tours around that time, they were all at Temple Brotherhood and Sisterhood sponsored tours. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1760.82s)]
*  Which is amazing for a guy who's basically whose argument is there's a problem with religion unless it's there's a problem with religion, but there's really a problem with one specific arena where we got to start. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1777.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1789.82s)]
*  And so he also cites this example that I have not seen evidence for. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1790.82s)]
*  These gay students that are against Iran or whatever. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1796.82s)]
*  Where are the gay students? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1799.82s)]
*  Yeah, protesting. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1800.82s)]
*  I perhaps it's true. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1802.82s)]
*  Perhaps there's a lot of coverage of this that I haven't seen these gay students protesting these savages in the Middle East for their oppression of women. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1804.82s)]
*  I am really sick of feminism being used for imperialist racist ends, especially from the mouth of somebody like Jake Tapper, who has consistently supported the genocide of Palestinians that included disproportionately women who were being slaughtered by this. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1812.82s)]
*  The usage of Western chauvinism to say that because there are fundamentalist Islamic religions in the area that are yes repressive of women, that that is a justification to dehumanize them or say that they are evil or that the Palestinian liberation cause should be broadly smeared. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1831.82s)]
*  It is about like using wealth and capitalism as a way to dehumanize a population that has been the whole region bombed by my country with my tax dollars for decades and decades and decades. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1849.82s)]
*  And many of those Islamic fundamentalist governments were propped up by our government because we thought that they were more easily controllable, including to this day. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1864.82s)]
*  They're doing deals with Qatar. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1874.82s)]
*  They're doing deals with Mohammed bin Salman, not a democratic leader, as we talk about democracy, who also oppresses women. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1876.82s)]
*  They're doing deals with CC, with leaders across the region to shape the region in their own vision. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1883.82s)]
*  And the idea that Tapper can sit there and say that there's their hypocrisy in terms of protesting what's going on there because they like white women have it better here. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1889.82s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrBwdrdVxY&t=1901.82s)]
