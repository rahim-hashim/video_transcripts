# America went four years without a president with his full faculties
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8)
*  Also, breaking tonight, a major policy win for the White House, and more importantly, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=0.0s)]
*  hard-working Americans in the service industry. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=5.0s)]
*  The U.S. Senate—get this—they just unanimously passed Donald Trump's No Tax on Tips Act. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=8.52s)]
*  Why did they ever think of it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=15.32s)]
*  They stand for the working men and women they used to. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=16.72s)]
*  Anyway, as per usual, this was a calculated political move by Democrats, who are just [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=20.0s)]
*  pretending to be supportive of tax cuts. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=25.72s)]
*  They only want piecemeal votes while really attempting to block the president's big, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  beautiful tax package that includes several other tax cuts, including no tax on overtime [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=33.68s)]
*  or Social Security, and, of course, the extension of the Trump tax cuts to make them permanent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=39.12s)]
*  from 2018. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=44.8s)]
*  If that bill passes, America will have the largest tax cut in history. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=46.4s)]
*  If Democrats ultimately get their way, taxes on all Americans who currently pay income [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  taxes will go way up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=56.94s)]
*  It will be the largest tax increase in American history. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=59.1s)]
*  Everyone's paycheck will go down. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=62.3s)]
*  That is why President Trump's big, beautiful tax bill is so imperative and important. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=64.46s)]
*  We're counting on the House tomorrow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=69.46s)]
*  But we begin with the last three favorite words, threat to democracy, and, well, their [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=71.62s)]
*  other favorite words, cheap fake videos, that were all too real. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=77.18s)]
*  Now, we've all heard Democrats and the legacy media mob use these words over and over and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=81.82s)]
*  over again to attack Donald Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  But as it turns out, it was all projection. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=89.7s)]
*  Now even fake news CNN, even MSDNC are admitting that Joe Biden was not fit to serve for four [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  long years, and everyone on the left willfully and purposely propped up a mentally, cognitively [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=100.69999999999999s)]
*  incompetent politician suffering from a steep decline. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=108.22s)]
*  Tonight, there is no debate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=112.42s)]
*  There never was. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=114.22s)]
*  America went four years without a president that had his full faculties, and Democrats, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=115.98s)]
*  they were ready to make it eight years before responding to polls and then quickly making [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=122.14s)]
*  a bait and switch and installing Kamala Harris to run in Joey's place without any kind of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=127.7s)]
*  democratic process at all whatsoever. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=133.78s)]
*  In other words, that was a threat to democracy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=136.26s)]
*  A president in a cognitive decline is a massive national security threat. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  But the Democrats and the legacy media mob, of course, hating Trump is always their number [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=144.66s)]
*  one top priority. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=149.5s)]
*  And to top that off, we are now suddenly learning that Biden, sadly, we pray for him and his [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=151.1s)]
*  family, they have been diagnosed, he's been diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=156.14s)]
*  that apparently is metastasized to his bones. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=160.78s)]
*  Most medical experts believe this likely took up to 10 years to get this bad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=164.26s)]
*  But we're supposed to believe that Biden's cancer went totally, completely, utterly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=169.38s)]
*  unnoticed during his time as president, despite the round the clock, world class medical care. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=174.34s)]
*  I saw it for my own eyes in the Middle East last week. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=180.46s)]
*  Any president has the best medical care at his disposal at all times as it should be. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=183.62s)]
*  A Biden spokesperson telling Fox News that his last known PSA cancer screening test was 2014? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=190.14s)]
*  Every man I know gets one every year. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  It's part of a blood test. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=201.7s)]
*  It's a simple test. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=203.22s)]
*  It's not a difficult test. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=204.66s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=205.94s)]
*  And of course, this leaves us with a lot of important questions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=207.38s)]
*  First and foremost, why would we believe anything the Bidens, the media or Democrats tell us? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=210.5s)]
*  And here's something really important that must be answered. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=216.82s)]
*  Did Joe Biden know or understand anything that he was signing into law? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=220.26s)]
*  Was he even aware that AutoPen was being used? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=224.82s)]
*  If the answer is no, are any of Biden's enacted laws and pardons, executive orders, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=228.26s)]
*  are they actually valid? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=234.02s)]
*  Now, earlier today, this is what President Trump had to say. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=235.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=238.1s)]
*  We're going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=239.7s)]
*  Who signed legislation opening our border? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=243.54s)]
*  I don't think he knew. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=246.02s)]
*  I said there's nobody that didn't want an open border. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=247.22s)]
*  And now I find out that it wasn't me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=250.9s)]
*  He AutoPen did. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=253.3s)]
*  Who was operating the AutoPen? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=255.06s)]
*  This is a very serious thing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=257.06s)]
*  We had a president that didn't sign anything. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=258.26s)]
*  He AutoPen almost everything. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=260.58s)]
*  He opened the borders of the United States of America. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=262.34s)]
*  And I kept saying, who would do such a thing, allowing criminals to border from all over [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=265.7s)]
*  the world, not just South America, all over the world? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=271.3s)]
*  Naturally, Democrats to the left, they don't want us to think about any of that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=274.98s)]
*  Instead, well, there are three political strategies, Democrats and they're, of course, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=278.42s)]
*  the extension of their press offices that media are using to gaslight all of you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=283.54s)]
*  So be on the lookout for the following tactics. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=289.38s)]
*  First, some simply want the American people to forget about the last four years. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  Let's just move forward. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=296.74s)]
*  Shall we take a look? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=298.1s)]
*  You said in June of last year, in my meetings with President Biden, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=300.42s)]
*  I found to be commanding the president, building influence to make progress on key priorities. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=304.26s)]
*  But in that same month, Biden Academy did not even recognize George O'Rourke, a fundraiser. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=309.86s)]
*  Were you being strayed with the American public? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=315.38s)]
*  Look, we're just looking forward. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=317.38s)]
*  We lied to you the whole time, but we're just looking forward. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=320.9s)]
*  Why admit to the truth? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=323.3s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=324.74s)]
*  Who cares that we propped up a president and name only while Americans suffered and suffered greatly? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=325.7s)]
*  We have known terrorists and rapists and murderers, cartel members, gang members. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=332.34s)]
*  As a result of that, the next tactic is a little more dishonest. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=336.34s)]
*  So, of course, it's the favorite of the so-called journalists in the media. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=340.02s)]
*  As our friend, liberal Joe says, liberal Joe Scarborough demonstrated, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=345.38s)]
*  some on the left are still pretending they won't open their eyes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=349.94s)]
*  They are pretending that there were no signs of Joe Biden's cognitive decline, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  which we chronicled before the 2020 election and almost every night in between. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=358.42s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  Looking back at that, do you say, well, it was misleading to say, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=364.66s)]
*  best Biden ever without caveating it and say, except on the days when he's not the best Biden ever. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=368.26s)]
*  Well, but I never saw those days personally. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, you did. You did because you saw him address a dead congresswoman [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=377.22s)]
*  and you saw him in South Carolina. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=380.1s)]
*  There were plenty of days in public when he was not the best Biden ever. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  He stumbled and he stumbled and he stumbled and bumbled around, Mark. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=386.26000000000005s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he he certainly did. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=390.02000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump did. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  Other politicians did. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  Those are some of the clips bad. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=394.74s)]
*  Yeah, they certainly they certainly are bad. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  Put in the proper context, I'm just not going to freak out and melt down on one or two clips here or there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  No, not one or two. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=406.82000000000005s)]
*  There's like one or two a day. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  Ah hummada hummada hummada. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=408.98s)]
*  Great job, Mark Halprid. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=410.26s)]
*  Liberal Joe, nobody believes you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=412.1s)]
*  You can quit the act. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=414.1s)]
*  Which brings us to our third political tactic, and that is the left that they're using to cover their tracks over on fake news CNN. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=415.54s)]
*  Fake Jake Tapper. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=423.46000000000004s)]
*  He's even now looking to profit from this political gaslighting. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=424.82s)]
*  In fact, Tapper is out with some brand new book detailing the shocking discovery that President Joe Biden was a cognitive mess and that the White House went to great lengths to conceal the truth. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=428.98s)]
*  So are we ever going to believe fake Jake was just totally blind, dumb and ignorant for four years? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=440.9s)]
*  I don't believe. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_zIxAtzIw8&t=448.58s)]
