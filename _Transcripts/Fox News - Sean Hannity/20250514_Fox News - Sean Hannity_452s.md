# They will steal your socks without taking off your shoes: John Kennedy
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g)
*  Now, as you just heard me discuss with President Trump, this has been a major week for his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=0.0s)]
*  administration as the president is racking up win after win for America, kind of what [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=7.36s)]
*  he said on the campaign trail on Monday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=12.24s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order slashing your drug prices in the U.S., most [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=14.68s)]
*  favored nation status, also a major trade breakthrough with China. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=19.72s)]
*  He also helped bring home the last American hostage being held by Hamas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=23.84s)]
*  And now the president, here he is in the Middle East where we are negotiating major investments [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=28.4s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=33.699999999999996s)]
*  All right, joining us now to discuss all this week's news, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=34.699999999999996s)]
*  is with us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=39.2s)]
*  Senator, two things really struck me today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=40.2s)]
*  As I watched the president and I thought it was deep and I thought it was profound, and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=44.12s)]
*  if he can achieve it, it would be beyond historic. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  And that was saying to the Saudis, join the Abraham Accords and also sending a very loud [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=54.0s)]
*  message again to Iran that you can have peace if you want it, but you're not going to be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  a nuclear state. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=65.8s)]
*  He's been very, very clear there's no ambiguity. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=66.8s)]
*  Reaction? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=69.56s)]
*  Well, I think Iran to me is obviously the most important issue. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=70.56s)]
*  the AYATOLA to have a nuclear weapon is unthinkable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=80.84s)]
*  If he gets a nuclear weapon, there's going to be a war in the Middle East. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=85.4s)]
*  And it won't be because we started it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=90.48s)]
*  It won't be because Iran started it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=92.4s)]
*  Israel will jump on. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=94.84s)]
*  They'll bomb Iran immediately. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  The president has to be very firm with Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  And he has to agree, in my judgment, to no nuclear power whatsoever, not military and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=104.36s)]
*  not civilian. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=113.76s)]
*  And he has to make it very clear. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=114.76s)]
*  We can do this the easy way, the hard way. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=117.1s)]
*  We want to reach an agreement with Iran. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=119.4s)]
*  If they give up their nuclear capabilities, we will take the sanctions off. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=122.08s)]
*  If not, we reserve the right to hit them so hard they'll cough up bones. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=127.48s)]
*  And that's just the way it is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=132.96s)]
*  Joe Biden couldn't pull that off with Donald Trump can. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=135.32000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you, Senator, because when you were last on the program, we were talking [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  about trade and tariffs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=145.12s)]
*  And what you said on this program is you hope that the president is able to get one deal [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  after another after another. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=154.44s)]
*  Great Britain, I don't think, really surprised everybody, but it was a good deal for the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=157.56s)]
*  U.S. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  The many years that friend and foe alike has kind of taken advantage of us, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=161.76s)]
*  So we have an opportunity here to really get things right, which I think is critical. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  And then China. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=173.0s)]
*  What do you make of that deal? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=175.12s)]
*  And what message do you think it sends to the rest of the world? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=176.92s)]
*  And Scott Besson said 130 countries are lined up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=180.16s)]
*  Well, I think it's obvious. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  that your parents drank, you see that it was a big victory, not just for President Trump, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=188.6s)]
*  but for America. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=194.12s)]
*  Before the president did what he did, China's tariffs on the United States were a little [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=195.84s)]
*  over 20 percent on average. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=201.76s)]
*  Now they're 10. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=203.88s)]
*  Our tariffs on China were a little over 20. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  Now they're 30. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  That's, what, a 20-point swing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, I've listened all day to some of my Democratic colleagues say that, well, we didn't get anything [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=212.32s)]
*  for it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=219.88s)]
*  You know, if you believe that, I'm not saying you're the dumbest person in the world, but [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=223.0s)]
*  you better hope the dumbest person in the world doesn't die. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  It was a clear victory. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=230.72s)]
*  The other point I would make, I think Trump understands how to deal with China. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=234.0s)]
*  Look, the Chinese, not the people of China, I'm speaking about the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=240.36s)]
*  they're thieves. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  They steal with both hands. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  They will steal your socks without taking off your shoes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=251.12s)]
*  That's how they've gotten rich. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=255.72s)]
*  We let them into the World Trade Organization on December 11th of 2001. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=258.0s)]
*  They started cheating December 12th. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=263.92s)]
*  Trump was the first president, he did this in the first term, to ever stand up to China [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=268.44s)]
*  and say, stop the stealing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  And now he's doubled down, and it's working. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=276.52s)]
*  We still got a long way to go. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  China cheats in other ways besides tariffs, with quotas and subsidies and stealing intellectual [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=282.08s)]
*  property, but this is a hell of a good start. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, so much other news. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=297.32s)]
*  I mean, drug prices for Americans will go down 30 to 80 percent. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=299.92s)]
*  Hopefully Putin and Zelensky can have a good meeting. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=304.36s)]
*  I understand the Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be a big part of that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=307.04s)]
*  Then you can look at the role that maybe they played in lowering the tensions between India [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=312.4s)]
*  and Pakistan. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=316.44s)]
*  And the thing that maybe infuriated me the most is, and we'll be in Qatar tomorrow night [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=318.08s)]
*  broadcasting, is the issue of the plane. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=322.28s)]
*  Our largest military base here in the Middle East happens to be in Qatar. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=326.0s)]
*  You know how much the Qataris have spent since 2003 on our military base? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  Over $8 billion. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  I didn't hear anybody complain about the $8 billion that they invested or the military [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  technology that we give them that helps secure their nation, just like here in Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=346.0s)]
*  So I just think it's part of an overall, you have to look at big pictures sometimes, don't [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=353.36s)]
*  you, when it comes to the issue of the plane? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=358.76s)]
*  Well, I think most Americans understand what's going on with the Democratic Party. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=361.52s)]
*  They're on their back foot. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=369.52s)]
*  And they're trying to, their leader is Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=371.68s)]
*  And she, years ago, she took a left, a sharp left and kept driving. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=378.12s)]
*  And she's moving their party to the left. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=384.18s)]
*  And she's losing the American people. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=386.36s)]
*  And the president keeps hitting them with one blow after another. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=389.2s)]
*  So the plane business is just one among a number of straws that my Democratic colleagues [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=393.12s)]
*  are grasping at. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  Them saying, well, the deal with China makes no difference. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=402.96s)]
*  You know, that's patently absurd. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=408.68s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=411.16s)]
*  But that's all they have, Sean. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=412.16s)]
*  I always knew that China would need access to our markets. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=416.32s)]
*  I think it will be mutually beneficial and long term. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=420.36s)]
*  And America standing up for itself and not being taken advantage of and abused is actually [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=425.04s)]
*  refreshing because that's been institutionalized for 60 years. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=429.72s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, we love having you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=433.56s)]
*  It's only like 4.30 something in the morning here, but we appreciate you being with us. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=436.16s)]
*  Anywhere else. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLlIU8G_5g&t=449.92s)]
