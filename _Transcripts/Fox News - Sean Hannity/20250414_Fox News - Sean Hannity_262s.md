# 'DEFUND ACROSS THE BOARD': Higher education has 'lost its way,' congresswoman argues
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c)
*  Now, earlier today, Harvard announced that it will defy President Trump's order to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=0.0s)]
*  cut DEI programs and expel pro-Hamas protesters, putting the school's federal funding at [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  risk. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=9.92s)]
*  Sadly, this is not the first time schools like Harvard sided with, let's see, a designated [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=10.92s)]
*  terror organization like Hamas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  You might recall. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=18.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=19.36s)]
*  At MIT, does calling for the genocide of Jews violate MIT's code of conduct or rules regarding [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=20.36s)]
*  bullying and harassment? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=27.38s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=28.38s)]
*  If targeted individuals not making public statements. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  If it is directed and severe or pervasive, it is harassment. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=33.46s)]
*  So the answer is yes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=37.26s)]
*  It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=39.26s)]
*  Anti-Semitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct that amounts to bullying, harassment, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=51.42s)]
*  So the answer is yes, that calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard code of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=56.86s)]
*  conduct, correct? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=62.9s)]
*  Again, it depends on the context. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=64.9s)]
*  It does not depend on the context. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  The answer is yes and this is why you should resign. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  These are unacceptable answers across the board. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=73.86s)]
*  All right, here with reaction New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=76.7s)]
*  You have gotten the same answer if it had to do with transgender or LGBTQ plus or race [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=82.5s)]
*  issue. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=89.14s)]
*  I tend to think not, Congresswoman. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=90.14s)]
*  Of course not, Sean. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=93.02s)]
*  And think about that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=94.4s)]
*  That hearing occurred during the Biden administration and what did we see from Joe Biden? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=95.44s)]
*  Zero action to protect Jewish students on campuses and to hold these universities accountable. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=100.3s)]
*  Two of those three university presidents were forced to resign and there was an additional [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=105.82s)]
*  from other universities that were forced to resign. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=110.56s)]
*  But President Trump correctly made the correct decision to defund these institutions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=112.56s)]
*  If you look at what they required for Harvard, it was protection of Jewish students. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=118.0s)]
*  It is making sure that we are getting rid of DEI, which by definition is anti-Semitic. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=122.4s)]
*  And instead, Harvard is acting more entitled than ever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=127.68s)]
*  President Trump made the direct and correct decision to defund to the tune of over $2 [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=131.84s)]
*  These higher ed institutions that have fundamentally lost their way, U.S. taxpayer dollars should [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=137.36s)]
*  never be propping up anti-Semitism and the vast majority of the American people support [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  President Trump and support the work that we are doing in Congress to hold these higher [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  ed institutions accountable. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, if as a country we want to help kids get through a local community college that's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  relatively inexpensive or maybe a trade school. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  I think American taxpayers would be far more accepting of that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=165.16s)]
*  Why should one taxpayer dollar go to these elite institutions and so-called institutions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  of education when they have billions and billions and billions of dollars in endowments? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=176.6s)]
*  Why don't they pay for their own scholarships? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=184.44s)]
*  Why are they relying on hardworking carpenters and nurses and brick layers and everybody [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=187.0s)]
*  in between landscapers to pay for somebody's Harvard education? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=194.68s)]
*  You are spot on, Sean, and the vast majority of the American people do not want to prop [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=199.72s)]
*  up these institutions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=203.84s)]
*  I myself am a first generation college graduate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=204.84s)]
*  I graduated from Harvard. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=208.12s)]
*  That's clearly not the achievement. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=209.56s)]
*  The achievement is maintaining my common sense and my conservatism and my strong values with [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=210.68s)]
*  which I was raised in and strong moral leadership. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=215.04s)]
*  There is so much opportunity across this country for the next generation, whether it's in the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=218.44s)]
*  workforce, whether it's in this manufacturing renaissance that is going to happen under [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  President Donald J. Trump, whether it's community colleges or trade schools vocational programs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=226.84s)]
*  That is a pathway to success. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=232.52s)]
*  Higher education has fundamentally lost its way and it's increasingly out of touch and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=234.6s)]
*  the tuition rates go higher and higher. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=238.96s)]
*  So we need to defund across the board. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=240.72s)]
*  And President Trump is rightly holding these schools accountable. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=243.08s)]
*  All right, Congresswoman, great job as always. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=246.08s)]
*  We do appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vsfd5tQSo5c&t=249.04000000000002s)]
