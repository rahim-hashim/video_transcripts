# Rick Perry: Weâ€™re praying for a miracle
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw)
*  We're praying for a miracle out there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=4.1s)]
*  That there's still some people alive. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  But we know that every day that goes by, that's probably not the case. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=7.82s)]
*  And we're in a major recovery effort now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=11.14s)]
*  And I mean, I've got a number of close dear friends that are there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=15.5s)]
*  Marcus and Morgan Latrell are both there on the ground in Kerrville looking for these [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=23.74s)]
*  children. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, just the common decency that our parents taught us about an event like [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=32.74s)]
*  this, to lift these people up in prayer, to give every bit of support that we can, find [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=40.94s)]
*  the ways that you can help this community instead of taking the cheap political shots. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=48.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=55.78s)]
*  I mean, I got to agree with you, Charlie. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=56.78s)]
*  This may be a new low. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=58.739999999999995s)]
*  I've been struck by how it's almost like this has sort of reminded us of what a small community [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=61.86s)]
*  the whole country is, because I'm sort of surprised by just running into people here [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=69.06s)]
*  in New York City on the street or family members that I know from Texas. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=73.3s)]
*  It seems like everybody you run into knows somebody who is directly affected by this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=78.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=83.69999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=84.69999999999999s)]
*  These camps were, you know, they were populated by people all across the state, Houston, Dallas, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  massive amounts of families who had children there at those camps. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=91.78s)]
*  And then there were just a lot of people there on the 4th of July weekend to go, you know, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=96.02s)]
*  enjoy the beauty of the Guadalupe River, hunt Texas and Ingram, Kerrville, places that just [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=101.46s)]
*  you know, bring great joy to people just to be in those and to have this extraordinary [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=109.34s)]
*  event. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=118.54s)]
*  I mean, this may be a once in a lifetime event and we see those from time to time. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=119.54s)]
*  And to try to start, you know, pointing fingers at this, there's plenty of time to look at [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=126.14s)]
*  this to come up with, you know, how can we do it better? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  Every major disaster that I dealt with as the governor, we sat down afterwards, after [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  we took care of the people, after we did the rescue, after we did the evacuations, and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=140.42s)]
*  then we analyzed it and said, how could we do this better? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=145.18s)]
*  And every time we found ways to do it better. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=148.22s)]
*  And that's what I would beg the people on the left who want to criticize Donald Trump [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  or criticize Republicans or, you know, find whatever the issue is that they want to go [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=157.9s)]
*  put their finger on and rush to that and make political points. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=162.52s)]
*  Do you think that- [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=166.12s)]
*  Please for all. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=167.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=170.12s)]
*  Do you think there were things that could have been done better? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=171.12s)]
*  Because obviously some of the, you know, the warnings, the first warnings came more than [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=173.72s)]
*  12 hours before the first floods arrived. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=177.28s)]
*  Maybe there was a breakdown. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=181.6s)]
*  It's, you know, obviously those, you know, the camps didn't know about it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=182.6s)]
*  Is there anything that you can think of that could have, should have been done better? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=189.52s)]
*  You know, second guessing is pretty easy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=194.52s)]
*  As we've always said, you know, sitting on the sidelines and, you know, telling the coach [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=196.8s)]
*  how to run the game and what have you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=200.8s)]
*  When we get to where we have perfection, understanding how Mother Nature is going to perform, then [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=204.0s)]
*  we can have this conversation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  My instinct is that they had plenty of people at the National Weather Service in San Antonio [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  people in San Antonio, Texas and the people that were there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=219.4s)]
*  You know, they looked at this, they thought it was going to be a seven, eight inch rain. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=223.52s)]
*  It turned out to be in some places 12 to 15 inches that we know about. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  And that type of nature's fury is just, you know, it's unbelievable and the damage that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  it can do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=242.0s)]
*  And there'll be plenty of time to, you know, second guess this later on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=243.36s)]
*  Right now, these people need our prayers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=246.96s)]
*  They need our support, whether you're treasure or whatever it is that you can give to the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=250.32s)]
*  people in central Texas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=255.16s)]
*  And there's going to be an extraordinary, you know, mental health effort here going [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=258.16s)]
*  on as we go forward. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=263.04s)]
*  So there's just, there's a lot of work to be done. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=265.04s)]
*  Let's come together as a country and quit this finger pointing for a little bit of time [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=269.36s)]
*  anyway, and help these families deal with this issue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=275.32s)]
*  Well Governor Perry, thank you so much for joining us and God bless you and the people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=279.68s)]
*  of your great state. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwnCubNMTiw&t=283.08s)]
