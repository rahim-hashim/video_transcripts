# Trump team ‘working OVERTIME’ to stop this ‘ticking time bomb,’ says Hannity
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight we start with this Fox News alert. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=2.04s)]
*  Moments ago, President Trump issuing a full and partial or partial travel ban from 19 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=3.84s)]
*  countries, including Yemen, Iran and Somalia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  We have full details straight ahead. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=13.3s)]
*  But tonight, buckle up, we've got a busy show. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=14.84s)]
*  In moments, the deputy director of the FBI, our friend Dan Bongino, he will join us with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=17.72s)]
*  an exclusive look into the absolute unmitigated mess that Joe Biden left this country in when [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=23.02s)]
*  he left office. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=29.88s)]
*  We have known terrorists. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=31.12s)]
*  We have Iranian assassination squads. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=32.42s)]
*  We have rapists. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=34.5s)]
*  We have murderers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=35.72s)]
*  We have cartel members. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=36.72s)]
*  We have gang members, drug dealers, all in this country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=37.88s)]
*  We all need answers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=41.76s)]
*  Cash Patel, Dan Bongino, Attorney General Pam Bondi, they apparently not only inherited [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=43.44s)]
*  a difficult job, but far worse than any of us knew, apparently. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=49.64s)]
*  We'll get the details tonight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=53.4s)]
*  Progress, thankfully, is being made. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=55.0s)]
*  We'll have more on that straight ahead. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=57.0s)]
*  Plus, Senator Kennedy has a message for the far left law professor that went before his [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=58.44s)]
*  committee. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=64.84s)]
*  And you say they're evil members of the United States Supreme Court? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=65.84s)]
*  Gag me with a spoon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=70.08s)]
*  We got that full exchange coming up and huge news from Karine Jean-Pierre. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  She's leaving the Democratic Party in an apparent PR stunt to sell her book. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=79.36s)]
*  It's not working if you look on Amazon. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=83.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=85.56s)]
*  The number one question they ask me is, Karine, how do we get out of this? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=86.92s)]
*  How do we protect our democracy? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  How do we protect vulnerable communities among us? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  What do we do next? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=95.88s)]
*  Because we don't have answers here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=97.84s)]
*  That's what they ask me. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=99.76s)]
*  And this is my answer. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  Now if her book is anything like her time as Biden's very own Baghdad Bob, well, it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=104.36s)]
*  will be poorly written and probably full of lies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=109.08s)]
*  But we begin with a much more important matter and important news tonight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=112.08s)]
*  That is the weaponized, politicized Justice Department that President Trump inherited. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=115.86s)]
*  A country that is not safe and secure. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=120.77999999999999s)]
*  A defense department that needs massive reform in the elimination of woke and the next generation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=123.13999999999999s)]
*  of weaponry. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=128.42s)]
*  But under Biden, the DOJ, the FBI became an enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  The red flags were everywhere. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=135.14s)]
*  And now it is up to Cash Patel, Dan Bongino, Pam Bondi to get to the bottom of what is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=137.26s)]
*  a massively long list of corruption. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=142.54s)]
*  This includes the unprecedented witch hunts against Donald Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=145.18s)]
*  The raid of his home. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  They didn't raid Hillary's home. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=150.18s)]
*  They didn't raid Joe's home. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=151.5s)]
*  FISA abuse with the dirty Russian disinformation dossier. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=153.02s)]
*  The national security probe into angry parents at school board meetings. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=157.06s)]
*  The targeting of traditional Catholics who are labeled as domestic terrorists by Joe [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=161.06s)]
*  Biden's FBI. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  And let's not forget about the obsessive and heavy handed January 6th prosecutors, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=167.5s)]
*  including some who just walked in and walked out of the Capitol building, apparently. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=173.3s)]
*  The same people, by the way, on the left, they ignored 574 riots. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=178.14s)]
*  They said it was the summer of love in the summer of 2020. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=183.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris, those rioters won't stop. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=186.74s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=188.82s)]
*  And by the way, we won't stop supporting them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=190.14s)]
*  We had two dozen dead. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=192.4s)]
*  We had a thousand cops injured and billions in property damage. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=194.22s)]
*  No investigation, no outrage. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=198.2s)]
*  Equally disturbing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=200.3s)]
*  The lack of prosecutions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=201.3s)]
*  Light sentences for violent rioters on the left. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=203.06s)]
*  They have all this videotape they could have used to find them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=206.94s)]
*  They're on video burning places down, throwing rocks at cops and bricks and bottles and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=209.78s)]
*  Molotov cocktails, including extremists that were dressed up like terrorists, openly threatening [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=214.5s)]
*  Jewish people and wrecking college campuses. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=220.84s)]
*  And while the Biden administration proudly labeled so-called right wing extremism as [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=224.06s)]
*  the existential and biggest threat to democracy in America, left-wing extremists, they went [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=228.64s)]
*  unchecked, including the illegal immigrant terrorists who were lighting Jewish people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  on fire as we watched this weekend in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=240.27999999999997s)]
*  As we have predicted on this show, the ultra lax enforcement of our immigration laws under [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  Biden is a ticking time bomb. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=249.64s)]
*  I keep saying it's not if, it's when, but I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=251.72s)]
*  I'm not wrong. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  The new leadership of the FBI, they are working overtime to locate and arrest terrorists, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=256.48s)]
*  rapists, murderers, cartel members, gang members. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=263.0s)]
*  In fact, so far, look at this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  The FBI has spent over one million manpower hours investigating, apprehending criminal [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=268.84s)]
*  aliens since Donald Trump took office, especially those involved in the drug trade, human trafficking. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=275.24s)]
*  Now, here's what they inherited. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=280.6s)]
*  Let me go through it slowly. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=282.48s)]
*  We have in our country, in your country, known terrorists, we don't know where they are. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=284.02s)]
*  Cartel members, we don't know where they are. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=289.74s)]
*  And by the way, Iranian assassination squads, and we don't know how to find them yet, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  either. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=297.58s)]
*  And gang members and murderers and rapists, other violent criminals and drug dealers, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=298.58s)]
*  cartel members, all in our country right now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=303.97999999999996s)]
*  I know there are also other very important issues. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=306.46s)]
*  The president, Cash Patel, Pam Bondi, Pam Bongino, they promised to get to the bottom [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=309.62s)]
*  of all of it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=314.64s)]
*  The Epstein files, RFK, JFK, MLK files. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=315.66s)]
*  Every one of these things is important. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=320.18s)]
*  I personally want answers. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=321.74s)]
*  We have been promised they would be forthcoming, and I believe they will be. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=323.94s)]
*  But the first priority has got to be national security. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=328.1s)]
*  The crisis left behind by Joe Biden, the most preventable national security disaster in [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=331.94s)]
*  our history. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=337.56s)]
*  We are seeing the results. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=339.0s)]
*  Murder is way down in almost every major city in the U.S. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=340.26s)]
*  The border is almost 100% secure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=343.72s)]
*  As you can see, the new leadership of the FBI does not have an easy job. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=346.2s)]
*  Again, they inherited an absolute, unmitigated disaster. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=350.48s)]
*  And to make matters worse, navigating the hyperpartisan anti-Trump bureau, that is no [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=353.44s)]
*  easy task. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=358.24s)]
*  You cannot get it anywhere else. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XBB2LeG8VE&t=368.56s)]
