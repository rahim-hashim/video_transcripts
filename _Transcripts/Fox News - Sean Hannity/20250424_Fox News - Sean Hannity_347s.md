*  This is what Democrats and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez now [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=148.6s)]
*  now believe and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=153.72s)]
*  a charitable [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=155.76s)]
*  Interpretation for this kind of behavior does not exist and and the American people look at it and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=159.12s)]
*  and they just want to jump out of a moving car and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=165.52s)]
*  And that's why Democrats are polling right up there with [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=169.6s)]
*  with scalp psoriasis [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=174.52s)]
*  in terms of the congresswoman [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=177.6s)]
*  Look I encourage her to run I [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=182.24s)]
*  Hope she I hope she does run I understand [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=185.44s)]
*  I listen to her speech. I understand her slogan is going to be change begins with a mustard seed [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  Which I think is interesting I guess if governor [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=199.16s)]
*  Pritzler runs he'll his slogan will be you can have a you can have a tummy and still be yummy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=204.6s)]
*  I don't I don't know. I just I just think with the congresswoman if you you scratch the surface you get [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=210.16s)]
*  More surface. I don't think she has the intellectual firepower to to run a campaign to be president [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=218.16s)]
*  But I hope she does [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting with Donald Trump [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=229.24s)]
*  I don't think the Democrats ever took the time or had the inclination or the even the ability or aptitude to understand Donald Trump [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=231.68s)]
*  And his appeal to the American people I think [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=238.04s)]
*  Authenticity wins elections and it wins hearts and minds and Donald Trump has that top the bottom. It's just authentic and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  This dark woke is is really interesting. You know Donald Trump took this lane called the common sense and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=248.52s)]
*  That meant that the Democrats being anti Trump had to go the opposite of everything that is common sense [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=255.6s)]
*  I mean, that's where I read it. I'm [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=261.92s)]
*  Am I wrong on that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  No, I think Trump beat Harris [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=267.44s)]
*  because Trump represented hope and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=271.12s)]
*  Harris represented more hurt [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=274.96s)]
*  But but I do think that what the American people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=278.32s)]
*  Trusted Trump most most on was the economy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=282.2s)]
*  Inflation I mean inflation was man-made and that man's name was Joe Biden and it gutted people like that like a fish [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=288.96s)]
*  And when moms and dads lie down to sleep at night Jason and can't they're they're worried about the economy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=296.36s)]
*  They're worried about the high prices. That's why we've got a pass the reconciliation bill [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=302.96s)]
*  Conciliation bill that's our plan to deal with with lowering these prices [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=308.2s)]
*  Now that is the key it is a team sport particularly in the house and it would be fascinated to see but [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=316.04s)]
*  That Trump agenda and that one big beautiful bill. We're counting on you and a whole lot of others to to make it happen [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=322.76s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, thank you for joining us. You're one of our favorites. We do appreciate it. Thank you for joining us tonight [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gxsa-ZaiUs&t=329.52s)]
