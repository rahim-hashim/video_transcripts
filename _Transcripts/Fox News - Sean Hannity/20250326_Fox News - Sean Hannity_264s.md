# Alina Habba: It is unbelievable what is happening
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I)
*  Here now with more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=0.0s)]
*  She's just been named interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=1.24s)]
*  I do recall she once said that she wasn't going into the administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=4.64s)]
*  She was going back to private practice. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=8.76s)]
*  Congratulations, Alina Habab. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=11.44s)]
*  My Biden memory is not recollecting anything that you just said. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=15.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, Sean. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=18.64s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=19.64s)]
*  That's a cheap fake. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=20.64s)]
*  I think I said that I was going in. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=21.64s)]
*  I was going in. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=22.64s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=23.64s)]
*  I said I wasn't going in, and here I am. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=24.64s)]
*  But I'm so happy to be proud of it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=27.96s)]
*  Look, let's not forget something, Sean. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=29.8s)]
*  Judge Chuckin, who was the hardest, I would say, arguably, in Washington, D.C., on January [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=31.96s)]
*  6, people that were taken in and not given due process, also happened to—whoopsie!—get [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=38.16s)]
*  President Trump's case. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=43.32s)]
*  This is not a coincidence. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=45.6s)]
*  Judge Engorin, who had no business having the commercial division case against Letitia [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=47.28s)]
*  James and—Letitia James against us, frankly, all of a sudden—somehow, all of a sudden, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=52.2s)]
*  the rules don't apply. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=57.84s)]
*  He gets the civil division, and a commercial division case is in front of Judge Engorin. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=59.16s)]
*  Let's go through another one, the Hush Money case. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=64.44s)]
*  Statutory limitations pass. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=67.64s)]
*  All of a sudden, statute limitations don't matter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=68.64s)]
*  If you committed a crime, it doesn't matter. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=71.42s)]
*  We'll find the crime. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=72.92s)]
*  It's unbelievable what is happening, and that is really the sum of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=74.2s)]
*  You want to talk to me about Doge. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=78.5s)]
*  You want to talk to me about what's happening with this signal nonsense, where they're [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=80.12s)]
*  communicating high-level people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=84.36s)]
*  Maybe a mistake was made, but at the same time, I'll tell you one thing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  There was high-side communications that were proper, that were done correctly, and nobody [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=89.63999999999999s)]
*  here got hurt. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  A. B. They were allowed to do it because there was no classified information. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  But you know what this is, Sean? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=99.52s)]
*  It's the same thing we've been talking about for four years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  It's a hoax. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  It's a distraction. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  It's the same thing they did when they said Biden had no cognitive decline, absolute garbage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  And they're going to continue to do it in this administration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=111.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=113.28s)]
*  Because we're winning. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=114.28s)]
*  And we're successful. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=115.36s)]
*  And we're going to keep hitting hard for the American people. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=116.36s)]
*  Alina, let's talk about your new position, because crime is rampant. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=118.84s)]
*  And now you even have a town, Patterson, New Jersey, which I guess is the Palestine of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  America or whatever they labeled it, and a police officer that has removed the American [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=130.6s)]
*  flag and replaced it, according to one report, with the Palestinian flag. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=135.64s)]
*  Those issues you'll take up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=140.56s)]
*  And what about the issue of crime in some of these cities, in Camden and Patterson, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  elsewhere in New Jersey, way out of control? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=145.88s)]
*  What will change? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=148.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'll tell you what will change. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=149.88s)]
*  I got a portfolio on what we're handling there, and I'm getting read into some things. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=153.24s)]
*  And I will tell you one thing. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=157.74s)]
*  It's concerning to me that the state of New Jersey and the U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=158.74s)]
*  has less than a third of criminal cases open and all civil fraud cases against God knows [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=162.08s)]
*  who. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=169.36s)]
*  It's going to change because President Trump has made a mandate that was given by the American [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  people in an astounding vote on November 5th, and that is to keep American cities safe. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  As to Patterson, New Jersey, I'll tell you one thing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=179.4s)]
*  Patterson is not Palestine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=182.0s)]
*  And I will look into that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=183.88000000000002s)]
*  It has been brought to my attention. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  I've seen the videos of that officer wearing a Palestinian flag instead of an American [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  flag. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=190.08s)]
*  And if there's any directive to be anything anti-American, I will look into it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=191.08s)]
*  New Jersey has been neglected. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  New Jersey is rampant with crime. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  We are unfortunately home to cities like Newark, New Jersey, with MS-13. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=199.28s)]
*  We have immigrants who are being harbored in sanctuary cities that will no longer happen [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=205.6s)]
*  when I'm there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=209.24s)]
*  We have Camden, New Jersey. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=210.44s)]
*  I can go on and on and on, but I will tell you one thing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=212.08s)]
*  I am America first. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=214.88s)]
*  I am President Trump's agenda first. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=215.88s)]
*  And that is what America wants. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=218.68s)]
*  We don't want crime. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=220.32s)]
*  We want to be able to walk through Newark, walk through and not be afraid in Camden. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=221.52s)]
*  And that has not happened in the great state of New Jersey. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=225.96s)]
*  That is my hometown. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=228.2s)]
*  I am so excited to go in and be given this opportunity by President Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, he really, honestly, he gave me such a gift in this role. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=233.28s)]
*  And I'm ready. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=238.6s)]
*  And I'm going to fight like hell. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=239.6s)]
*  That I know. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=241.92s)]
*  The people of New Jersey are—buckle up, get ready. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=242.92s)]
*  And with the support of Pam Bondi, I know the two of you will be a great one-two punch. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=246.12s)]
*  She's the greatest. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  Alina, congrats. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YyBJLJ_V-I&t=253.96s)]
