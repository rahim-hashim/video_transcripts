# Karoline Leavitt: No other president had the courage to do this
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8)
*  Anyway, here now with reaction, we get our White House briefing with White House press [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=0.0s)]
*  secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=4.96s)]
*  Caroline, you're doing a great job. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=6.4s)]
*  I watch you every day, and I'm like, it's dazzling to watch. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  They don't know how to deal with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=12.72s)]
*  They haven't figured it out yet, and I don't think they're going to be able to figure it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=14.64s)]
*  out because they don't really have good arguments. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  And between you and the time the president gives the media mob, they can't be unhappy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=20.16s)]
*  with that because they never got any under Joe. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=25.66s)]
*  No, they're very happy with the transparency and the accessibility of President Trump in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=29.92s)]
*  this entire administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=35.2s)]
*  I was so proud to stand in the cabinet meeting yesterday, Sean, when the president invited [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=36.84s)]
*  the press into the meeting where he went around the table and instructed each and every one [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=42.56s)]
*  of his cabinet secretaries to provide an honest update about what they are doing at their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=47.92s)]
*  respective agencies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And every cabinet secretary is a rock star. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=54.86s)]
*  They are passionate about the issues they are leading on, and they are delivering on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=57.42s)]
*  exactly what President Trump called upon them to do. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=61.42s)]
*  There is so much good news flowing out of this administration every day. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=64.86s)]
*  It's definitely hard for the media to keep up with. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=69.18s)]
*  They don't know how to cover this administration. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=72.22s)]
*  They are grasping at straws. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=74.76s)]
*  And it's easy to talk to the press every day because President Trump is doing exactly what [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  he promised the American people he would do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  And there are wins after wins after wins every single week at this White House. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=83.7s)]
*  And we saw those wins this week, Sean, not just the cabinet meeting yesterday. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=88.16s)]
*  Look at the CPI report that came out yesterday as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=92.26s)]
*  Inflation is dropping, jobs report, jobs are up. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  The border is the most secure it has ever been in United States history based on the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=97.38s)]
*  sheer unprecedented record low number of illegal crossings. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=102.18s)]
*  This has all been done in 80 days because of this president. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  We had another U.S. citizen who returned home, who was detained in Russia after more than [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=109.78s)]
*  a year. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=114.74s)]
*  Did you know that the Trump administration has freed more than half of Americans from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=115.74s)]
*  around the world, have brought more than half of the number that Joe Biden brought home [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=119.86s)]
*  in four years? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has done it in 80 days. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=124.46s)]
*  We are moving, we are working, and we're working at Trump's speed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  And the president has put together just an incredible team that's working hard every [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  day to deliver on his promises to the American public. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=134.14s)]
*  But it's even more than that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=138.86s)]
*  We had a record jobs report, which nobody was predicting, inflation at its lowest level [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=139.86s)]
*  in a long, long time, years as a matter of fact. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=145.34s)]
*  The federal deficit we learned today that in March it tumbled to a five-year low. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  And then you add to that the 75-plus, maybe it's more by now, countries that as a result [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=157.22000000000003s)]
*  of the president saying it's either going to be free or fair trade or reciprocal tariffs, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=163.86s)]
*  they all want to come to the table. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  They all want to deal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  And I'm told that deal number one is close to being finished. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=174.82s)]
*  It is true. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=175.82s)]
*  We believe that there could be some several deals very soon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=178.46s)]
*  More than 75 countries have reached out to the administration. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=182.38s)]
*  More than 15 offers are on the table. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=186.18s)]
*  And the president's trade team and the president himself are working very hard to negotiate [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=188.94s)]
*  tailor-made trade deals with every country that has reached out. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=194.22s)]
*  No other president has had the courage to fully use the leverage of the United States [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=198.78s)]
*  of America, not just our economic might, but our military and national security might as well. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=204.06s)]
*  And, you know, I was asked an interesting question earlier this week by a reporter [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=210.62s)]
*  at Fake News CNN. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=214.46s)]
*  She said at the premise of her question, you know, Caroline, the whole world is on notice [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=215.82s)]
*  because of what President Trump is doing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=220.46s)]
*  And I said to her, that's exactly the point. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=222.06s)]
*  The world is on notice. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  The world is finally realizing that under this president, the United States of America [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=226.7s)]
*  is not going to be taken advantage of. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  This is a president who is going to put our country, our people and our needs first. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  And now the rest of the world is calling our administration. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=238.78s)]
*  The phones are ringing off the hook because they need the United States of America, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=242.06s)]
*  not just our economy and our market, but they need us to continue providing peace around [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  this world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=251.42s)]
*  And they know that they are indebted to us for the stability that we have provided in [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=252.14s)]
*  their own countries for decades. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=256.3s)]
*  And the president has made that very clear, that the American people are finally going [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=258.3s)]
*  to have the front seat at the table and thank God for it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=263.02s)]
*  You know, you're right, because it's been 50 or 60 years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=266.78s)]
*  The American people have been ripped off. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  They've really hurt our manufacturing in this country and even for vital products. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=273.26s)]
*  And I know maybe change for institutionalists and establishment people is a little bit [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=278.46s)]
*  difficult, but that's not how Donald Trump rolls. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=285.18s)]
*  He thinks out of the box. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=287.74s)]
*  He's a disruptor. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=289.18s)]
*  He's an iconoclast. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=290.14s)]
*  And it is a complete reset. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=291.82s)]
*  And the world better get used to it fast. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=294.14s)]
*  This is the new normal. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=296.14s)]
*  This is what America first looks like. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=297.74s)]
*  I'll give you the last word. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=299.58s)]
*  This is what Democrats and Republicans have been calling on presidents to do for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=302.78s)]
*  decades to reorder the global trading system in which the United States has been ripped [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=307.82s)]
*  off, in which our nation has been bankrupt with crippling deficits with nearly every [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=314.06s)]
*  single country on the planet. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=318.62s)]
*  Finally, President Trump is standing up and saying no more. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=320.38s)]
*  He has the courage to use the leverage of this great country to put our workers first. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=323.82s)]
*  And the American people and small business owners and CEOs on Wall Street and owners [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  on Main Street and manufacturing workers are going to be better off because of the economic [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=333.42s)]
*  agenda of this president. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=339.26s)]
*  And it's not just tariffs, Sean, it's tax cuts, too. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=340.62s)]
*  And those are coming because of President Trump's determination. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  The House passed the framework for the budget reconciliation process yesterday. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  We are moving towards some of the largest tax cuts in American history, coupled with [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=351.74s)]
*  massive deregulation, massive energy boom that's going to lead to even lowering, more [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=356.46000000000004s)]
*  lowering of prices in our great country. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=362.86s)]
*  Trust in President Trump. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=365.74s)]
*  It's an economic formula that works. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=367.1s)]
*  He did it in his first term and he's doing it again. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=369.18s)]
*  All right. That's our Hannity White House briefing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=374.38s)]
*  We always love having you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=376.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKewyq05sc8&t=377.18s)]
