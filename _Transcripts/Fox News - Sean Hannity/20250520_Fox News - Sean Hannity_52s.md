**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E)
*  I'd say, look, the president doesn't bluff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't bluff. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  I said the day after inauguration, when they started attacking ICE and Border Patrol and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  supporting sanctuary cities, I said, you can hate on ICE. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=7.54s)]
*  You can support sanctuary cities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=10.58s)]
*  You can turn a blind eye to ICE taking public safety threats off your streets. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=12.4s)]
*  But you can't cross that line. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=16.28s)]
*  Sean, I said that a thousand times. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=17.64s)]
*  You can't cross a line of impediment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=19.54s)]
*  You can't cross a line of knowingly harboring, concealing illegal alien from ICE. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=21.62s)]
*  You can't commit criminal trespass. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=26.1s)]
*  And you certainly can't put hands on an ICE officer or you will be prosecuted. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=29.16s)]
*  I said it a thousand times. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=34.12s)]
*  I meant it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=35.68s)]
*  President Trump means it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=36.68s)]
*  We already got two judges being prosecuted. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=37.68s)]
*  Now we got this councilwoman being prosecuted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=39.96s)]
*  It's the right thing to do because they broke the law. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=42.16s)]
*  They're not above the law either. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=44.64s)]
*  They say President Trump was above the law. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Either are they. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_fL_Hxw8E&t=47.96s)]
