# ‘NOT A MYSTERY’: Stephen Miller says Dems want illegal aliens to vote
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo)
*  Here with reaction the White House deputy chief of staff [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=0.0s)]
*  for policy advisor [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=3.6s)]
*  Stephen Miller is with us. So the claim is and Hillary made this claim and many others [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=5.8s)]
*  69 million married women won't be able to vote if they took on the name of their husband that they will [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  disenfranchise [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=18.8s)]
*  American voters and its voter suppression by the way, this is an [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=20.04s)]
*  8416 issue in terms of the polls voters want ID [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=25.0s)]
*  Signature verification chain of custody controls updated voter rolls [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=29.52s)]
*  They want partisan observers watching the voting all day the vote counting all night [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=33.6s)]
*  That brings integrity to the process and confidence and results. Why would you be against it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=38.92s)]
*  The only reason Sean you would be against any of that is if you wanted illegal aliens to vote and to vote in incredibly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=45.0s)]
*  large numbers [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  So let's just deal with all of this BS right now [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=55.36s)]
*  Every other country in the world of any note requires an ID to vote [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=59.36s)]
*  The notion that Democrats are pushing that married woman who by the way are a Republican voting demographic [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=64.04s)]
*  Cannot get ID could be one of the dumbest talking points [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=71.16s)]
*  I have heard in my entire life as you said the real ID the real ID act [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=74.64s)]
*  Creates an ID that you can get to the DMV that demonstrates you're a citizen [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Democrats want illegal aliens to vote [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=84.08s)]
*  It's why Joe Biden his administration gave millions we verified this now millions with an M of illegal aliens [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=86.0s)]
*  Social security numbers and once you have a social security number [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=92.72s)]
*  It is incredibly easy to vote to collect welfare to get free government benefits to participate in every aspect of American life [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  This isn't a mystery. They want [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  illegals to steal election Sean [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=107.36s)]
*  All right, Stephen what you're saying echoes exactly what Doge found [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=110.16s)]
*  Because not only did millions of illegal immigrants [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=114.44s)]
*  They were they aided and abetted into the country by Biden and Harris [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=118.56s)]
*  Then they get [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=123.24s)]
*  Let's see Social Security numbers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  That they obtain then they get voter ID many of them apparently voted according to Doge in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=127.72s)]
*  2024 and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=134.0s)]
*  Elon Musk is saying it may be the the biggest scandal of all time and it's not a loophole [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=135.44s)]
*  But quote a deliberate system [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  Non-citizens file for asylum get work authorization [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=144.76s)]
*  Then that automatically triggers the Social Security number and from there you get your driver's license [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=148.56s)]
*  And from there you get to vote or register to vote and it was by design. That's their that's their belief [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=154.56s)]
*  It is is absolutely by design. You've summarized it for your audience perfectly Sean [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=161.72s)]
*  This was not a loophole the body of the administration [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=167.2s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas devised a scheme [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=169.84s)]
*  to fly illegal aliens into the country and then to escort them in masks across the border by the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=176.16s)]
*  Millions and to give them something known as parole which gives them a work permit which gives them a social which gives them a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=181.84s)]
*  Social Security number which gives them access to the voting booth [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  This was the plan all along to get them here illegally so they can get free government benefits [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=192.0s)]
*  Get hooked to welfare and be able to participate in American elections [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=197.56s)]
*  This was an attack on democracy by the Democrat Party. It's the same attack that we see Sean [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=202.2s)]
*  When you have California a sanctuary state that is refusing to turn over even [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=208.84s)]
*  illegal alien criminals and gang members to ice so these are illegal aliens in California who have been arrested by [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=215.08s)]
*  California police by [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=222.77999999999997s)]
*  California law enforcement for serious crimes for crimes against children for felonies for crimes that threaten public safety and they are [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  Refusing to hand these criminal illegal aliens over to ice instead [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=232.38s)]
*  They're freeing them back into the cities to offend and offend again by any definition [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=236.05999999999997s)]
*  What California is doing is criminal. It is a violation of our laws [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=241.7s)]
*  It is one of the most heinous things that I have seen in my entire life in Washington [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=246.38s)]
*  But but think about this Stephen Miller you go down to the border and if you were to assist [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=252.54s)]
*  Known illegal immigrants and let's say transport them. Are you aiding in a betting law breaking? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=258.94s)]
*  Wouldn't you get arrested wouldn't I get arrested wouldn't anybody watching the show get arrested? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=265.06s)]
*  Yes, in fact you would do significant jail time particularly under the policies of this administration by the same by the same token if [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=270.9s)]
*  you as an American citizen [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=279.02s)]
*  Put say a child into the back of a truck and drive them across straight lines [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  You'll be prosecuted for child trafficking the Biden administration [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=285.74s)]
*  itself the actual government of the United States [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=289.58s)]
*  trafficked [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=293.78s)]
*  500,000 children into this country and help them to disappear [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=295.38s)]
*  That is criminal and to back to the point about sanctuary states and sanctuary cities. There are laws against harboring [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=299.5s)]
*  There are laws against evading authorities. There are laws against smuggling laws against concealing laws against obstructing justice [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=306.14s)]
*  President Trump as we speak is working on an executive order. They'll be issued in the very near future [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=313.46s)]
*  That will clamp down and crack down on sanctuary cities as never before [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  This is a cancer on our democracy the effort of the radical left to shield even the most violent illegal aliens from enforcement [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=325.22s)]
*  President Trump will be soon taking action. It'll be more robust and more aggressive than anything done in this area before [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=334.02s)]
*  Now that'll be transformational. It'll make our country more safe and secure our town safe and secure our city safe and secure [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, Stephen Miller. We appreciate you being with us. Thank you when we come back. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2O44cWpwo&t=348.29999999999995s)]
