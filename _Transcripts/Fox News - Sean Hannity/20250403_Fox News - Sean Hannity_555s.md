# ‘CHICKEN LITTLES’: Another predictable cycle of feigned moral outrage
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs)
*  And welcome to Hannity as we begin another busy news night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=0.0s)]
*  In just a moment we're going to bring you all the big developments from President Trump's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=3.44s)]
*  Liberation Day shakeup. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  We will also help educate, it's a public service, Democrats, a legacy media mob about the virtues [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=8.98s)]
*  of fair trade, the virtues of a little bit of courage and not living your life in total [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=15.16s)]
*  complete cowardice and fear. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=20.8s)]
*  And later, Senator Lindsey Graham, he's unveiling a bold new plan to move fast on the president's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=23.32s)]
*  economic agenda in Congress, including permanent tax cuts, no tax on tips, Social Security, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=29.76s)]
*  overtime, with or without Democratic support, without any input from the Senate Parliamentarian. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=35.6s)]
*  We'll explain, gets a little complicated, not too complicated. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=40.84s)]
*  Also tonight we're going to get a progress report from Bordersar, Tom Homan, who continues [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=44.44s)]
*  to outflank one far left activist judge after another. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=49.56s)]
*  And the great Stephen A. Smith is going to join us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  He's going to tell us why he's now growing weary and skeptical of Barack Obama. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=57.4s)]
*  And in our other news of the day segment, we have, well, NHL fights, Whoopi's resistance, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  and we'll tell you where to go to survive an alien invasion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=70.36s)]
*  I'm sure you've all been waiting for that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=73.56s)]
*  But we begin with another predictable cycle of feign moral outrage from the Democratic, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  radical left, the chicken littles of the left. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=81.32s)]
*  They're at it again for about the 500th time in a decade. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=84.56s)]
*  They tell us the world is coming to an end. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=88.52s)]
*  It's over. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=91.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's smoke, this time over President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=92.56s)]
*  Look, it's a choice between protecting American industry. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=96.8s)]
*  It's about saving you money. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=101.7s)]
*  It's about high paying career jobs for hardworking Americans all across the country versus allowing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=103.98s)]
*  the rest of the world to rip you off and restrict our products in their markets and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=110.32s)]
*  walk all over our workers and walk all over our country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  Democrats they've chosen the latter. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  This is particularly insane coming from a party that loves to use the phrase working [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=122.6s)]
*  folks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=127.8s)]
*  Remember not long ago, Democrats, they claim to care about the Rust Belt, American manufacturing, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  about union workers, about living wages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=134.28s)]
*  They're the minimum wage party. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  Maybe that's where they want everybody, on minimum wage. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=138.68s)]
*  Even Nancy Pelosi promoted tariffs as a critical tool to protect American industry against [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=141.68s)]
*  unfair practices of foreign countries. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=148.8s)]
*  Sounds like Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=151.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=152.98s)]
*  In terms of tariffs, I think it's interesting to note that the average US MFM tariff on [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=154.54s)]
*  Chinese goods coming into the United States is 2%. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Whereas the average Chinese MFM tariff on US goods going into China is 35%. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=163.72s)]
*  Is that reciprocal? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=170.72s)]
*  You have a serious threat not only to our relationship but to the industrialized world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=172.68s)]
*  And if there's one message that I want our colleagues to understand today and our constituents [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=177.84s)]
*  is that on this day, your member of Congress could have drawn the line to say to the President [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=183.0s)]
*  of the United States, do something about this US-China trade relationship that is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=188.72s)]
*  a job loser for the United States. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=192.96s)]
*  Wow, sound familiar? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=196.24s)]
*  She even used the word reciprocal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=198.14s)]
*  As a matter of fact, eight years before Pelosi made those remarks, Donald Trump was on with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=200.12s)]
*  Oprah Winfrey with a similar message. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=206.0s)]
*  The only difference is Pelosi changed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=209.04s)]
*  Trump did not. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=211.52s)]
*  We're a debtor nation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=212.52s)]
*  Something's going to happen over the next number of years with this country because [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=215.44s)]
*  you can't keep going on losing 200 billion and yet we let Japan come in and dump everything [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=217.86s)]
*  right into our markets. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=222.66s)]
*  It's not free trade. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=224.62s)]
*  If you ever go to Japan right now and try to sell something, forget about it, Oprah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=225.62s)]
*  Just forget about it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=229.26s)]
*  It's almost impossible. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=230.26s)]
*  They don't have laws against it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=231.26s)]
*  They just make it impossible. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=232.26s)]
*  They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, they knock the hell out of our [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=233.82s)]
*  companies and hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=237.22s)]
*  You can respect somebody that's beating the hell out of you but they are beating the hell [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=241.18s)]
*  out of this country. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=244.26s)]
*  In Kuwait, they live like kings. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=245.26s)]
*  The poorest person in Kuwait, they live like kings and yet they're not paying. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=246.94s)]
*  We make it possible for them to sell their oil. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  Why aren't they paying us 25% of what they're making? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=253.1s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=255.7s)]
*  Why doesn't Oprah, why didn't she support him? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=256.7s)]
*  Anyway, unlike Pelosi, President Trump still cares about American workers, the American [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=260.46s)]
*  industry, and a lot of industries are impacted by this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=265.3s)]
*  He meant what he said. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=268.96s)]
*  He campaigned on restoring free and fair trade and now he's fulfilling his commitment that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=270.26s)]
*  he made to all of you, the American people and on the other side of the aisle, Democrats [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=275.58000000000004s)]
*  are perfectly content to overlook unbalanced tariffs that effectively block American products [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=280.1s)]
*  abroad. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=286.26000000000005s)]
*  The Party of Compassion also seems to have no problem with Chinese sweatshops, other [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=287.26000000000005s)]
*  foreign businesses flooding our market with cheap goods, intellectual property theft and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  they do it year after year. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Killing off, high paying American jobs in the process. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=299.82000000000005s)]
*  It really does make you wonder, do the Democrats stand for anything other than biological [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=303.74s)]
*  men playing women's sports, open borders and unlimited government waste, fraud, abuse and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  corruption? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=313.98s)]
*  Oh and bingo cards when a president is speaking. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=314.98s)]
*  Just so we are clear, the world is not ending. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=318.7s)]
*  Instead, as we speak, dozens and dozens of countries are desperately trying to negotiate [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=322.06s)]
*  with the White House. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  They don't want Donald Trump's tariffs. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=330.26s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=333.38s)]
*  Most of them will give in and capitulate and he will win. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=334.46s)]
*  The playing field is now getting leveled. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=337.26s)]
*  A little messy in the beginning. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=339.14s)]
*  As Treasury Secretary Scott Bissen pointed out, Trump's reciprocal tariffs plan is a [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=341.1s)]
*  winning strategy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=346.06s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=347.34s)]
*  Everybody sit back, take a deep breath. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=349.42s)]
*  Don't immediately retaliate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  Let's see where this goes because if you retaliate, that's how we get escalation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  Remember that the history of trade is we are the deficit country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=358.58s)]
*  The deficit country has an advantage. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=367.14s)]
*  They are the surplus countries. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=369.52s)]
*  The surplus countries traditionally always lose any kind of a trade escalation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=371.26s)]
*  So as a student of economic history or a professor of economic history, I devise against it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  So amid all the hysteria on the left and in the media mob and the Democrats, there are [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=382.97999999999996s)]
*  two important points to remember. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=387.82s)]
*  One, as Bissen described, this plan is based on logic and leverage led by a president who [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=389.54s)]
*  is a natural born dealmaker. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=396.26s)]
*  Two, this is the land of the free, the home of the brave, where manifest destiny becomes [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=398.46s)]
*  reality for people. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=404.3s)]
*  This is the last place on earth where free thought, new innovative ideas are welcomed, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  rewarded where almost anything is possible with hard work, sound principles, a positive [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=412.34s)]
*  attitude. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=417.74s)]
*  And by the way, this perfectly describes President Trump. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=418.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=422.04s)]
*  I think it's going very well. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=423.04s)]
*  It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=425.04s)]
*  And it's a big thing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=429.04s)]
*  I said this would exactly be the way it is. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  We have six or seven trillion dollars coming into our country. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=434.48s)]
*  And we've never seen anything like it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=439.2s)]
*  The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=442.24s)]
*  And the rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzPQy8LxNKs&t=446.48s)]
