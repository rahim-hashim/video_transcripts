# Sean Hannity: This was a pointless political stunt
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU)
*  Allow me to introduce you to the new face of hypocrisy, hysteria, feigned moral outrage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=0.0s)]
*  inside the Democratic Party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  That would be Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=7.58s)]
*  Now, when Joe Biden allowed an estimated, what, 12-plus million unvetted illegal immigrants [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  to pour into our country, including known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=15.84s)]
*  gang members, Van Hollen did nothing, and he said nothing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=21.52s)]
*  In Maryland, a mother of five, Rachel Moran, was raped brutally, murdered brutally by [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=25.34s)]
*  an illegal immigrant from El Salvador on a Maryland hiking trail. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=30.66s)]
*  Van Hollen could only be bothered to release a shortwritten statement to a news outlet. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=35.7s)]
*  When 20-year-old Maryland woman Kayla Hamilton was raped and murdered in her own Maryland [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=40.94s)]
*  home by another illegal immigrant from El Salvador, Chris Van Hollen expressed zero [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=45.86s)]
*  public outrage. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=51.28s)]
*  But now that a citizen from El Salvador, not Maryland, who entered our country illegally [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=53.06s)]
*  and was accused of assaulting his own wife and accused of our own federal government [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  under two administrations of violent gang activity, now that this illegal immigrant [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=63.86s)]
*  has been deported back to his home, all of a sudden Chris Van Hollen is all up in arms. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  He has found his voice. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=76.26s)]
*  He is outraged. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=77.66s)]
*  In the past 48 hours, Van Hollen has rushed in front of every microphone, every camera [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=79.34s)]
*  he could find, giving one impassioned plea after another, vowing to rescue and bring [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=83.94s)]
*  back to America this illegal immigrant that got deported. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=89.7s)]
*  And today, Chris Van Hollen flew to El Salvador for the dumbest, most pointless political [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=94.5s)]
*  stunt in recent history. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=99.66s)]
*  We'll let you decide. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=101.42s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=102.78s)]
*  I'm here at the airport. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=103.78s)]
*  I'm about to board my flight for San Salvador. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  The goal of this mission is to let the Trump administration, to let the government of El [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=108.54s)]
*  Salvador know that we are going to keep fighting to bring Abrego Garcia home. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=113.22s)]
*  I just landed at the airport in San Salvador a little while ago. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  As I've said before, the goal of my visit is to talk to people here about the release [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=123.02s)]
*  of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=128.82s)]
*  And I won't stop trying. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=131.58s)]
*  And I can assure the president, the vice president, that I may be the first United States senator [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=133.5s)]
*  to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more and there will be more members [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=140.10000000000002s)]
*  of Congress coming. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=145.3s)]
*  I tend to doubt it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=147.3s)]
*  But by the way, if he does, if he is successful, maybe he can invite him to live with him. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=148.3s)]
*  It's no surprise Van Hollen left empty-handed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=152.5s)]
*  He couldn't even get a phone call with this illegal immigrant, much less secure his release [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=155.36s)]
*  from an El Salvador jail. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=159.74s)]
*  But Chris Van Hollen is still vowing to quote, bring him home. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=162.34s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  Now, Chris, he is, he is home. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  He is not a Maryland man like you and every other Democrat and everyone in the state-run [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=169.58s)]
*  legacy media mob is claiming. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=174.22s)]
*  He's not an American. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=176.62s)]
*  He's not your constituent. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=178.22s)]
*  He was not in our country legally, according to a report, John Solomon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=180.06s)]
*  He even admitted to police that he entered our country illegally. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=185.4s)]
*  In other words, you're a lawmaker, right? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=189.5s)]
*  Didn't follow our laws, didn't respect our borders or our sovereignty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=192.46s)]
*  He had no right to be here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=196.18s)]
*  And you know who should still be here safe and sound in your state of Maryland? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=198.54s)]
*  That would be Kayla Hamilton and Rachel Moran. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=204.82s)]
*  But you didn't lift a finger for Rachel or a family or anyone in your state or anyone [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=207.66s)]
*  in this country to protect them from the likes of those illegals that murdered them or are [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=212.26s)]
*  involved with them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=217.66s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen, well, couldn't be bothered with their safety and security. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=219.32s)]
*  To be honest, he's barely said anything at all about these two victims of illegal immigration. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=222.88s)]
*  He might not even know who they are. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=228.24s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen is a disgrace to the entire state of Maryland, frankly to the entire country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=229.92s)]
*  You know, this performative art is just a joke. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=236.0s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=239.82s)]
*  He's grandstanding. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=240.82s)]
*  It's frankly repulsive. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=241.82s)]
*  He should be ashamed of himself. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=243.2s)]
*  Better yet, maybe he should take some time and listen to Rachel Moran's mother and reevaluate [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=245.16s)]
*  his entire political career. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=250.64s)]
*  Here's what she said on our show last night. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=252.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=254.96s)]
*  Did you ever get a call from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Alejandro Mayorkas or your [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=255.96s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen, who made a big deal about he's going to go to El Salvador and bring [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=264.78s)]
*  home this one illegal from El Salvador, who Democrats are saying had no business being [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=272.5s)]
*  sent back to his home country? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=279.94s)]
*  Did they ever call you? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=281.66s)]
*  And what are your thoughts on your Senator going to bat for this illegal? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=283.42s)]
*  But did he ever say anything to you and your family about your loss to ever call you, ever [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=290.74s)]
*  take the time to be with you? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=295.12s)]
*  No, actually, I'm very angry. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=297.7s)]
*  I'm actually outraged, but I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=301.5s)]
*  He did not call our family. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=308.7s)]
*  He did not give condolences. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  There was no action on the Democratic Party in any way, from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=313.28s)]
*  Mayorkas, anyone here in Maryland, none of the senators, did anything to help search [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  for the murderer of my daughter. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=329.76s)]
*  Now, in case the senator did miss our show, only hours ago, Patty Morin had this to say [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=331.76s)]
*  at the White House briefing with Caroline Levitt, and Caroline will also join us later [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=338.76s)]
*  in the show. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  Why are we not protecting the American citizens? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  It's just common sense. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=351.08s)]
*  Why are we not protecting our children? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=352.36s)]
*  To have a senator from Maryland who didn't even acknowledge or barely acknowledged my [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=356.32s)]
*  daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  and now a grandbaby without a grandmother, so that he can use my taxpayer money to fly [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=373.32s)]
*  to El Salvador to bring back someone that's not even an American citizen. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=381.4s)]
*  Why does that person have more right than I do or my daughter or my grandchildren? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=388.4s)]
*  I don't understand this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  I've said it before. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  I will say it again. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayorkas, and everybody that stood by silently and didn't lift a finger [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  to secure our border, as far as I'm concerned, they all have blood on their hands. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, they did not have the courage to even call these families, Lake and Riley's [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=414.04s)]
*  family, they didn't have the courage to call Jocelyn Ungary's family or, you know, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=419.88s)]
*  in this case, Rachel Morin's mother. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  Why not? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  And why didn't they speak out about Biden's open borders? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=429.32s)]
*  Why didn't they seem to have even the slightest interest in honoring Rachel Morin or any of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  the other victims of illegal immigration? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=437.48s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen needs to sit down or shut up, or maybe he could just stay in El Salvador. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=439.8s)]
*  To be honest, Van Hollen should be thanking President Trump for doing something he himself [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=445.64s)]
*  never had the courage to do, protecting the people, the moms and dads, the sons and daughters [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  of children in Maryland and deporting illegal immigrants who never should be in our country [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  at all. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=462.52s)]
*  If they want to come in our country, come in, come in legally. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgcqyf8gbmU&t=463.52s)]
