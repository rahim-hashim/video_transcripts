# 'ULTIMATE NIGHTMARE': This is the 'most horrible thing' I've ever seen, Sen. Ted Cruz reveals
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=0.0s)]
*  Recovery efforts continue in central Texas [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=5.0s)]
*  after flash floods over the weekend left more than 100 dead, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=8.0s)]
*  with over 160 people still missing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=11.0s)]
*  But in typical, predictable left-wing fashion, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=14.0s)]
*  Democrats and their allies in the corrupt media mob [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=18.0s)]
*  wasted no time politicizing this latest tragedy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=21.0s)]
*  The left immediately blamed President Trump's budget cuts, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=26.0s)]
*  false, and Texas Senator Cruz, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=29.0s)]
*  who was on vacation with his family at the time of the flooding. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=32.0s)]
*  And he quickly returned to his home state of Texas [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=35.0s)]
*  and has been there to help. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=38.0s)]
*  Senator Cruz joins us now with more. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=40.0s)]
*  Senator Cruz, if you'd like to have a word about that, please do. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=43.0s)]
*  But I'm most interested in hearing an update on the floods [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=46.0s)]
*  and the recovery efforts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=50.0s)]
*  Well, Kellyanne, it's great to be with you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=53.0s)]
*  And I will say the state of Texas, we are grieving right now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=55.0s)]
*  Our hearts are broken. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=59.0s)]
*  What happened in the early hours of July 4th was truly devastating. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=61.0s)]
*  I spent all day on Monday in the Hill Country in central Texas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=65.0s)]
*  And the floods, in less than an hour, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=69.0s)]
*  the Guadalajara River rose more than 30 feet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=72.0s)]
*  It resulted in utter devastation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=75.0s)]
*  Today, the death count is at 119 people that were killed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=79.0s)]
*  There are over 165 people who are still missing, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=84.0s)]
*  and there may be more than that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=87.0s)]
*  And where the devastation was the greatest was a girls' camp, Camp Mystic. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=89.0s)]
*  Camp Mystic is 100 years old. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=94.0s)]
*  It was founded in 1926. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=96.0s)]
*  And to date, 27 girls and counselors were killed from the flooding. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=98.0s)]
*  I will tell you, on Monday I was at Camp Mystic. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=105.0s)]
*  I saw the devastation. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=108.0s)]
*  And it is the most horrible thing I've ever seen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=110.0s)]
*  Kellyanne, you know both our girls, Caroline and Katherine. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=115.0s)]
*  Both our girls went to camp in the Hill Country, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=119.0s)]
*  just a few miles away from Camp Mystic. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=122.0s)]
*  Just two weeks ago, a week before this happened, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=125.0s)]
*  my wife Heidi was there picking up our youngest daughter Katherine from camp. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=127.0s)]
*  I've got to say, the parents, the moms and dads in Texas [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=132.0s)]
*  who are grieving beyond that they dropped their little girl off at camp [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=137.0s)]
*  to have an amazing time, to be canoeing and swimming [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=142.0s)]
*  and doing horseback and archery, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=146.0s)]
*  and suddenly out of nowhere they're killed in a horrific flood. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=148.0s)]
*  It is, the pain is being felt all throughout Texas and all throughout the country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=152.0s)]
*  And every mom and dad, you're a mom, Kellyanne, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=158.0s)]
*  this is the ultimate nightmare. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=161.0s)]
*  And our state is hurting right now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=164.0s)]
*  Senator Cruz, I can hear and see the pain in this interview, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=167.0s)]
*  and we all share it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=171.0s)]
*  We are grieving with the state of Texas and for these families, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=172.0s)]
*  and also for those who are still missing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=175.0s)]
*  And I know the rescue and recovery efforts continue. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=178.0s)]
*  I don't understand the lack of compassion, the heartlessness, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=182.0s)]
*  the lack of any kind of dignity, love, thoughts, prayers, a dollar. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=186.0s)]
*  Lend a hand, donate something, contribute. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=191.0s)]
*  Show up and help from your colleagues on the other side of the aisle. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=193.0s)]
*  Yes, you're on vacation with your family, good for you, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=197.0s)]
*  because you worked tirelessly for weeks if not months on that big, beautiful bill. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=199.0s)]
*  And not a single one of the same Democrats now attacking you and President Trump [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=203.0s)]
*  dared vote for that bill. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=207.0s)]
*  That would help. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=209.0s)]
*  And so the lies have to stop, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=210.0s)]
*  but the sheer lack of compassion and heartlessness [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=212.0s)]
*  is something I just cannot abide, acknowledge and accept. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=215.0s)]
*  Well, look, there are certainly partisans who, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=220.0s)]
*  in the face of any natural disaster, they try to politicize it, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=222.0s)]
*  and they try to attack whether it's a hurricane, a tornado or a flood. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=225.0s)]
*  And so if a hurricane happens, there are people on the left that say, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=230.0s)]
*  the hurricane is Donald Trump's fault. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=233.0s)]
*  And so very quickly, people in the press and partisan Democrats [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=235.0s)]
*  tried to blame this flood on President Trump. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=240.0s)]
*  Those arguments were ridiculous. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=243.0s)]
*  I will say, with some credit to my colleagues in the Senate, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=244.0s)]
*  in the hours since this happened, I have had an enormous number of my colleagues [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=247.0s)]
*  in the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, reach out and say, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=252.0s)]
*  this is horrific, our hearts are breaking, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=255.0s)]
*  and anything we can do to help Texas, we're there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=257.0s)]
*  You know, as the flood was happening, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=261.0s)]
*  it happened at 3 and 4 in the morning on the 4th of July. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=263.0s)]
*  Within hours, I was on the phone with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=267.0s)]
*  I was on the phone with Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=270.0s)]
*  I was on the phone with Nim Kidd, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=273.0s)]
*  the head of Texas Emergency Management. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=274.0s)]
*  And then I called President Trump, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=277.0s)]
*  and I called President Trump at the time he was having dinner in the White House. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=279.0s)]
*  And I said, Mr. President, it's still early. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=282.0s)]
*  The facts are still not entirely clear, but this is bad. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=285.0s)]
*  It looks really, really bad. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=288.0s)]
*  I said there could be an enormous number of fatalities [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=289.0s)]
*  as we're getting the news reported in. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=293.0s)]
*  And I said, we need federal resources marshaled and marshaled fully. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=295.0s)]
*  And the president said, Ted, whatever Texas needs, the answer is yes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=300.0s)]
*  We are 100 percent there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=305.0s)]
*  And I got to tell you, look, as horrifying as this was, it was also inspirational. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=308.0s)]
*  Within hours, we had more than a dozen helicopters in the air, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=314.0s)]
*  Coast Guard, National Guard, Texas DPS. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=318.0s)]
*  They performed over 850 high water rescues. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=321.0s)]
*  When I was there on Monday, I went up with a Coast Guard helicopter. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=326.0s)]
*  I met with a Coast Guard swimmer, Scott Ruskin. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=329.0s)]
*  He is credited with 165 rescues. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=333.0s)]
*  They landed him at Camp Mystic on the highest spot there, a field. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=337.0s)]
*  There were more than 100 girls there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=343.0s)]
*  You had pelting rain, torrential rain. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=346.0s)]
*  He spent three and a half hours as they airlifted those girls off of the camp [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=349.0s)]
*  because the roads were all flooded. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=354.0s)]
*  They put about 15 girls in each helicopter. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=355.0s)]
*  And the girls were crying. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=358.0s)]
*  They were terrified. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=361.0s)]
*  Some of them, many of them were singing hymns. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=362.0s)]
*  This is a Christian camp. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=364.0s)]
*  And when I talked to Scott Ruskin, he told me he had just gotten off the phone [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=366.0s)]
*  with a mom and dad and a little girl who called him and they said, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=370.0s)]
*  you saved our daughter's life. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=374.0s)]
*  And they said that she was scared out of her mind. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=376.0s)]
*  And you calmed her. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=378.0s)]
*  You held her hands. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=379.0s)]
*  You put her on the helicopter. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=380.0s)]
*  You held her hand. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=382.0s)]
*  You said you're going to be all right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=383.0s)]
*  And Coast Guard swimmers, if you've ever encountered them, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=385.0s)]
*  they're kind of a mix of Navy SEALs and California surfers. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=389.0s)]
*  And like Scott Ruskin, he said to the press this week, he said, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=394.0s)]
*  I'm just a dude, which is a very Coast Guard swimmer thing to say. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=397.0s)]
*  But these guys are incredibly fit and courageous. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=401.0s)]
*  And I got to say he was moved to tears by the impact of the lives he was saving. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=406.0s)]
*  We were seeing that over and over and over again as Texans were helping Texans. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=413.0s)]
*  And we will come through this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=419.0s)]
*  My message is a message of hope that we are strong. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=421.0s)]
*  We are helping each other. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=424.0s)]
*  We will recover. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=426.0s)]
*  The parents are grieving. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl27mpxr_wM&t=427.0s)]
