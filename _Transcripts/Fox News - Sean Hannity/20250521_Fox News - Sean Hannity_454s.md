# We saw a president who couldn’t finish a sentence without taking a nap: Sen. Kennedy
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o)
*  Joining us now with reaction Louisiana senator John Kennedy is with us senator great to see you. How are you sir? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, thanks Sean [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  You know you one of my favorite interviews because you're you're down home [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  You kind of folksy and you make a lot of sense and I like common sense, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=11.88s)]
*  So I'm thinking maybe we're a lot alike [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=16.4s)]
*  Because I bet you had children and when your children did something wrong, which every kid is gonna do right, you know [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=20.52s)]
*  We roll with that but then when your kids say to you, you know [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=27.18s)]
*  They have chocolate cookie all over their face [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=32.22s)]
*  You told them not to eat the cookie and this cookie all over their face and they look in the eye and they said no [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  I did not eat the cookie [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=38.62s)]
*  I assume you're the kind of guy that gets more mad at the lie than you do with the actual act of eating the cookie [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=39.739999999999995s)]
*  Because that's how I am. I feel like this lie is far more serious because it was our national security and that is we had a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  compromised a cognitive cognitively [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=55.54s)]
*  Compromised president and now we're finding out they didn't give this guy a PSA [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=58.62s)]
*  What since 2014 the most basic test ever with the best medical care and that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=64.82s)]
*  Anybody would ever have in the country seriously. Can you explain this? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=72.22s)]
*  No [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=77.3s)]
*  No [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=78.62s)]
*  My biggest concern with all of this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=80.62s)]
*  Has to do with the with the the state of the media in America today shown [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=85.54s)]
*  And let me explain what I mean by that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=92.7s)]
*  I watched bits and pieces of the White House Correspondents Association dinner this year [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=95.9s)]
*  And I listened to speaker after speaker all Washington reporters [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  Defend [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=107.14s)]
*  freedom of the press [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=108.66s)]
*  And I kept thinking they wouldn't have to defend it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=110.66s)]
*  If they didn't work so hard to undermine it every day [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=115.06s)]
*  The American people saw what I saw what you saw for years [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=120.66s)]
*  With respect to President Biden and and I'm sorry President Biden is sick [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=124.9s)]
*  But we all saw the same thing for years. We saw a president [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=129.62s)]
*  Who couldn't finish a sentence without taking a nap? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=134.54s)]
*  We saw a president sure who an elderly man who talked like he was from outer space [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=138.94s)]
*  he [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=146.38s)]
*  He walked like he was underwater you could you could you could bake a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=148.38s)]
*  Thanksgiving turkey and the time it took him to walk across the stage [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=154.9s)]
*  90% of the American media not only never reported that but when [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=158.82000000000002s)]
*  Democrats and many Republicans raised the issue [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=166.18s)]
*  They pushed back [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=171.18s)]
*  They pushed back [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=173.18s)]
*  And this is just one more example [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=175.18s)]
*  of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=179.06s)]
*  So many members of our media squandering the trust of the American people there are other examples [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=181.94s)]
*  The Steele dossier the hunter Biden laptop [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=188.66s)]
*  I mean I could go on and on and on but that to me is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=192.18s)]
*  What makes me want to stick my head in an oven? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=197.58s)]
*  Today, I'm not going to go to the White House [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=202.46s)]
*  I'm going to go to the White House and I'm going to go to the White House and I'm going to go to the White House [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=205.74s)]
*  Today that the media is happy after mr. Tapper's books coming out the media is happy to report it [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=210.34s)]
*  But none of them have taken [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  Responsibility for not reporting what was so obvious to the American people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=219.38s)]
*  Hypocrisy never takes a vacation around here. I can tell you [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=225.82000000000002s)]
*  You know the senator we were showing videos of his cognitive decline [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  Long before the 2020 election and we showed it regularly [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  The I and and fake Jake Tapper's as we showed in fake news CNN. They were out there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=240.62s)]
*  I was being excoriated for at least a year and a half two years and beaten up and then it was called cheap fake videos [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=246.9s)]
*  As we just played and and I'm sitting here. You really have to be either [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=254.34s)]
*  ignorant or dumb or have a political agenda [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=261.06s)]
*  I [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=264.18s)]
*  Think they always had a political agenda and it was to stop Trump hate Trump Trump derangement syndrome [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=266.18s)]
*  That's the root of it to me. What is the root of it to you? I have heard one reporter [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  I think his name is Alex Thompson with Axios [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=279.66s)]
*  Stand up and say we should have done our job [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=284.74s)]
*  We should have reported what we saw [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=288.86s)]
*  Now many people in the media now are reporting on mr. Tapper's book [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=291.98s)]
*  But I haven't heard a single other than mr. Thompson a single member of the Washington Press Corps stand up and say [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=298.26000000000005s)]
*  Boy, we blew that and that's what I mean by squandering the American people's trust [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=307.42s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=314.42s)]
*  I [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=316.74s)]
*  Think that they thought I don't think they were in love with President Biden [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=317.74s)]
*  I think they thought that anything that hurt President Biden [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=321.3s)]
*  Would help the Republicans and would help President [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=326.62s)]
*  President Trump and it's this persistent [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=330.9s)]
*  This persistence in practicing advocacy journalism [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=336.7s)]
*  That is destroying freedom of the press and the First Amendment in America today [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  And there's just there's either no self-awareness among many among many members of the media or their line [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=347.7s)]
*  Because it's so obvious. I'm not asking them to take my side on everything [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=355.14s)]
*  I'm just asking them them meaning members of the media to be curious [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=360.78s)]
*  You know what they say? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=367.34s)]
*  I said after the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  November 5th election the state-run [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=373.5s)]
*  Legacy media mob is officially dead, but they don't know it yet. I think they're dead [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=376.38s)]
*  They have lied one too many times you mentioned Hunter Biden laptop you mentioned [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=382.02000000000004s)]
*  FISA you mentioned the dirty Russian dossier. They all knew that Joe was in cognitive decline [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=387.42s)]
*  They all lied they all covered up and the American people rightfully have determined. They're not trustworthy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=393.14000000000004s)]
*  You have to earn people's trust senator you do and one of the ways you earn it is you be honest with them [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=400.02s)]
*  They were never honest. I'll give you the last word [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=405.38s)]
*  well to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=408.26s)]
*  To gain respect you have to act [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=411.42s)]
*  Respectfully and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=415.9s)]
*  Responsibly and that to me is the story and all of this is it's not President Biden [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=417.94s)]
*  God bless him. I'm sorry. He's sick. It's not a book [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=424.34s)]
*  It's the trust of the American people that the media squandered [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=428.26s)]
*  They all knew senator and if they say they didn't know I don't believe them [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  Of course, I have my opinion. Of course. They know hey Sean Hannity here [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYJC58wzY8o&t=438.7s)]
