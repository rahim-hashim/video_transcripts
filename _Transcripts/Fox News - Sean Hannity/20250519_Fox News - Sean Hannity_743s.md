# Someone tell me who was in charge during Biden's presidency, because it wasn't Joe: Hannity
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight, FIRED former FBI Director Jim Comey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=0.0s)]
*  He is at it again after posting seashells seemingly calling for Donald Trump to be murdered [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=10.72s)]
*  or 8647 on Instagram. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=16.48s)]
*  Gee, he never thought what that might mean. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=19.52s)]
*  Anyway, Mr. Heyer honored James Comey, the coward that he is, ran to his favorite network, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=22.48s)]
*  the SDNC, to declare his righteousness, his innocence, and there were no heartfelt apologies, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=28.72s)]
*  no well wishes for the president, who was shot on stage only a few months ago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=34.8s)]
*  Instead, Comey was full of excuses and he actually tried to make the case that it's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=39.44s)]
*  not Donald Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=44.72s)]
*  No, he's the victim here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=45.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=47.88s)]
*  And we saw in the sand someone had arranged shells with numbers and Patrice, my wife, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=48.88s)]
*  said, why would someone put an address in the sand? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=54.6s)]
*  And I said, I don't know. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=56.88s)]
*  And we stood over it and I said, you know, I think it's some kind of political message. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=58.44s)]
*  And she said, you know, 86, when I was a server, she did a lot of work in restaurants, meant [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  to remove an item from the menu when you ran out of ingredients. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=66.8s)]
*  And I said, well, to me, as a kid, it always meant to leave a place, to ditch a place. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=69.64s)]
*  It's hard to have regret about something that even in hindsight looks to me to be totally [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=73.84s)]
*  innocent. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=78.32s)]
*  Sounds a little too cute by half, doesn't it, the head of the FBI? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=79.32s)]
*  He knows what 86 means, to be 86. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=83.36s)]
*  James Comey to me is a liar who from day one has tried to get Donald Trump one way or another. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=87.0s)]
*  He used Hillary's phony, dirty, Russian disinformation dossier, you might recall, to obtain secret [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  FISA warrants against the Trump campaign. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=99.55999999999999s)]
*  And spy on that and his transition team and the White House, he personally signed three [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=102.6s)]
*  out of four of them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=106.96s)]
*  He perpetuated the Russia hoax even when he knew it was a smear campaign orchestrated [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  by Democrats. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=114.16s)]
*  And according to reports, he was warned in 2016, in August, to be specific, not to use [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=115.76s)]
*  the political research, which now has totally been debunked. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=122.48s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it was only years later, under questioning from Senator Lindsey Graham, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=126.8s)]
*  that he finally admitted that knowing what he knows now, he never would have ever signed [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=132.16s)]
*  the warrants. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=137.44s)]
*  Wow, we knew it then. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=138.44s)]
*  He knew it then, too. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=139.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=141.2s)]
*  Think then what you know now about all the things that we've come to find. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=143.08s)]
*  Would you have still signed the warrant application against Carter Page in October, January and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=148.56s)]
*  April? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=153.4s)]
*  No, I would want a much more complete understanding of what we were— [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=154.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=159.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=160.24s)]
*  No, he wouldn't have. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=161.24s)]
*  And by the way, that Carter Page, that was a backdoor to all things Trump world. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=162.88s)]
*  Actually, it's what he knew then. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=167.08s)]
*  That's what matters. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=170.2s)]
*  Under his repulsive so-called leadership of the FBI, he transformed what was the world's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=171.88s)]
*  premier law enforcement agency into nothing more than an arm of the Democratic Party and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=176.76s)]
*  became from day one the leader of the Trump Derangement Syndrome Deep State. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=182.12s)]
*  And now he wants to sell a book, wants to get rich, while casually calling for what? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=187.38s)]
*  Putting out an Instagram post, 8647? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=193.12s)]
*  That sounds like somebody wanting the assassination of a sitting U.S. president. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=196.56s)]
*  And then let him act like—I have no idea what that means. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  I think it's political in nature. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=204.08s)]
*  Oh, let's act dumb. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=205.84s)]
*  It's time for Comey to be held accountable. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=207.52s)]
*  Now, we'll have much more on this straight ahead tonight, but first we do begin with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=209.8s)]
*  terrible news. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=213.56s)]
*  Joe Biden, the former president, has now been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  Sadly, this has metastasized to his bones. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  Of course, everybody should pray for him, wish him well. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  is a horrific disease, and no one deserves to go through this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=228.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, Biden's cancer is aggressive, with a Gleason score of 9, which is almost [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=233.4s)]
*  unheard of, according to close friends, medical doctors that I know. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=239.88s)]
*  And according to most physicians, this type of prostate cancer, it takes years to get [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=244.44s)]
*  to this point. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  Even over at MSDNC, one-time Biden ally, oncologist Zekael Emanuel stated with quite [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  confidence that the former president likely had prostate cancer for up to 10 years, including [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=257.68s)]
*  all four years that he was in the White House. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=265.68s)]
*  Doesn't it take some time for prostate cancer to develop to a point where it would spread [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=266.68s)]
*  to the bones? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=275.0s)]
*  Oh, he's had this for many years, maybe even a decade, growing there and spreading. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=276.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  This is not speculation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  If you have prostate cancer that has spread to the bone, then he's most certainly, you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=286.48s)]
*  are saying, had it when he was president of the United States. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=292.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=295.56s)]
*  He did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=296.56s)]
*  He had it while he was president. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  He probably had it at the start of his presidency. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=303.16s)]
*  Now keep in mind, this is generally a slow-moving cancer. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  As a matter of fact, most men will die with some prostate cancer, but they won't die [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=311.88s)]
*  from prostate cancer. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, it's one of the most detectable cancers that does exist. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  In fact, detection is very simple, a standard blood test. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=322.28s)]
*  They call it a PSA test. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=325.88s)]
*  And for the last four years, the president has enjoyed world-class medical care as president [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=327.79999999999995s)]
*  with rigorous testing, or what they should have, what should have been rigorous testing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=334.4s)]
*  So the question tonight, what happened? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=339.14s)]
*  Why are we learning about this stage four cancer diagnosis now? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=341.96s)]
*  It is sadly metastasized to his bones. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=346.94s)]
*  That has now put his life in jeopardy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=349.9s)]
*  Of course, this comes in the shadow of a very real cover-up conducted by Joe Biden's family, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=351.9s)]
*  his staffers, the state-run legacy media mob surrounding the former president's obvious [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=357.5s)]
*  cognitive decline, or as Van Jones put it very truthfully, a crime against our republic. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=362.66s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  I was shocked to see his condition when he came out, and so was the world. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  And that wasn't the first time he was in that condition. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=375.54s)]
*  The book makes it very, very clear. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  There are people who knew and said nothing. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=379.74s)]
*  And that is a crime against this republic. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think the Democrats are going to pay for a long time for being a part of what is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=387.14000000000004s)]
*  now being revealed to be a massive cover-up. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=390.9s)]
*  Now, every week since at least 2019, right here on this program, we sounded the alarm [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=393.14s)]
*  about Joe Biden's mental difficulties and his cognitive decline. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=400.18s)]
*  Now, at the time, we were ridiculed, we were mocked, we were called conspiracy theorists. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=404.9s)]
*  But every night, we brought the tape to you, our viewers, very real, not cheap fake videos [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=410.52s)]
*  of Joe Biden struggling to function. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=417.08s)]
*  They didn't do any of this on fake news, CNN or MSDNC or the three major networks. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=420.54s)]
*  That would include, by the way, The Washington Post, New York Times. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=427.42s)]
*  They lied to their readers, they lied to their viewers, they did it day after day, they did [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=430.44s)]
*  it night after night. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=434.14s)]
*  And they lapped up whatever garbage the White House was feeding them about Joe Biden's. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=435.54s)]
*  This has to do with the fact that he stutters or, you know, it's hard for us to keep up [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=440.58s)]
*  with him, even though we're only, you know, 30 years old. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=445.58s)]
*  Now, fake Jake Tapper, he's poised to make a lot of money, pretending that he and other [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=448.42s)]
*  journalists were a victim of a White House cover-up. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=453.3s)]
*  Jake, if you have eyes to see and ears to hear, did you really think it was strange [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=456.22s)]
*  that Joe was taking every weekend off while never doing any unscripted pressers, getting [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=462.42s)]
*  his questions ahead of time from your fellow journalists? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=469.1s)]
*  Well, what about falling again and again and wandering offstage and getting lost and never [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=473.66s)]
*  holding cabinet meetings? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=478.54s)]
*  What about the Her report? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=480.3s)]
*  The special counsel declined to recommend charges in Biden's classified documents [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=482.18s)]
*  probe, not from a lack of evidence, but because they determined that Joe Biden wasn't fit [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=487.18s)]
*  to stand trial or, as Her himself put it, the president was an elderly man with a very [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=492.38s)]
*  poor memory. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=498.26s)]
*  The Biden White House fought tooth and nail to prevent the audio of that interview from [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=499.5s)]
*  being released and for good reason. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=504.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=506.44s)]
*  In the meantime, is that as Trump gets elected in November of 2017? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=529.94s)]
*  2016. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=542.46s)]
*  2016. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=543.46s)]
*  2016. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=544.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=545.46s)]
*  So, why do I have 2017 here? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=546.46s)]
*  That's when you left office, in January of 2017. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=552.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=556.46s)]
*  But that's when Trump gets sworn in. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=558.4200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=563.4200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=564.4200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=565.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=566.4200000000001s)]
*  And in 2017, Bo had passed and, man, this is personal. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=567.4200000000001s)]
*  He didn't know the year that his son passed. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=582.22s)]
*  He didn't know the year that Donald Trump was elected. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=584.78s)]
*  Now, my father died in late March of 1997. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=587.22s)]
*  I remember it well. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=593.18s)]
*  The meandering interview was really bad. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=594.74s)]
*  There were points during the interview where Biden didn't make any sense at all. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=600.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=614.62s)]
*  I said, hey, a hundred yards away, and these guerrillas were, you know, taking shots. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=644.66s)]
*  And I think, I don't know if that's going to embarrass me or make a point, but I handed [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=650.66s)]
*  the bow and arrow. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=655.66s)]
*  I'm not a bad archer. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=657.66s)]
*  But I don't like to file that word if I can pull it back. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=659.66s)]
*  So I, and true to luck, I hit the **** mark. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=662.66s)]
*  No, I really did. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=667.66s)]
*  Whoever told Biden it was a good idea to run for re-election? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=670.6999999999999s)]
*  Why did they lie to all of you? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=674.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, was it the woman pictured right there sitting at the head of Biden's last [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=676.66s)]
*  Cabinet meeting, Dr. Jill Biden? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=682.5s)]
*  Did she not know? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=684.98s)]
*  Really? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=685.98s)]
*  Are we to believe that? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=686.98s)]
*  You know, did she not know firsthand about her husband and the cognitive struggles that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=687.98s)]
*  were clear and obvious to anybody with eyes to see? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=692.7199999999999s)]
*  Now, either she's delusional or she's simply just flat-out lied to everyone. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=696.5400000000001s)]
*  And so did her staffers. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=701.46s)]
*  And so did elected Democrats on the Hill and the state-run legacy media mob. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=702.86s)]
*  This is probably the biggest scandal in American presidential history, certainly the greatest [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=707.58s)]
*  national security threat in history. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=713.14s)]
*  And so, like many Americans, I have questions about the timing of all of this. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=716.7s)]
*  And while we're at it, could someone really tell us, you know, who was in charge during [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=722.82s)]
*  Biden's years as president? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=726.86s)]
*  Because it wasn't Joe. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUByfL2tF1w&t=729.5s)]
