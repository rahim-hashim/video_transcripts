# Karoline Leavitt says Trump is ‘demanding answers’ on Biden presidency #shorts #news #politics #us
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4)
*  Yes, all of those announcements coming from the FBI, Cash Patel, and of course our great [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=0.0s)]
*  Attorney General, Pam Bondi, who is committed to the truth, Sean, just like President Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=4.64s)]
*  and his entire administration, and committed to an unprecedented level of access and transparency [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=9.58s)]
*  that is led by President Trump at the White House every day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=15.48s)]
*  He takes questions from the press. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=19.0s)]
*  He talks directly and honestly and candidly about the problems and the challenges he is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=20.98s)]
*  not just here at home but also abroad. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=26.5s)]
*  And he's demanding answers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=28.82s)]
*  And one of the things he is going to continue to push for answers on is who the heck was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=30.1s)]
*  running the country over the past four years. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=33.84s)]
*  And you just talked about it in your monologue, and I'm glad to hear it, because this is truly [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=35.78s)]
*  the greatest political scandal our country has ever seen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=40.58s)]
*  We had unelected, radical left White House staffers who nobody knew their names running [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=44.22s)]
*  the most powerful country in the history of the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=51.1s)]
*  And the Democrat Party was in a complete alliance to cover it up, and the mainstream [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=54.18s)]
*  media was right along with them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=58.78s)]
*  They were asking Joe Biden what his favorite ice cream was rather than asking him whether [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=60.14s)]
*  or not he was suited to run the country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=64.46s)]
*  And so we need answers on what took place over the past four years, because look at [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=67.42s)]
*  the consequences of having these unelected, radical left-wing staffers in the West Wing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=71.02s)]
*  running the country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgjSZPXN5Q4&t=75.86s)]
