# Dems' policies have put you all at 'risk'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg)
*  But first, back here at home, our top story, it is hard to imagine a more divisive, mean-spirited [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=5.88s)]
*  In fact, their constant hysteria has long spilled over into outright violence. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=6.88s)]
*  And to make matters worse—and we're going to look at this from a whole different perspective—their [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  policies have put all of you at risk. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=18.44s)]
*  This is something we have warned about over and over and over again, the number one preventable [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=21.86s)]
*  national security risk. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=28.02s)]
*  It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=30.220000000000002s)]
*  I pray to God I'm wrong. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=33.1s)]
*  Have you heard those words from me? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=36.5s)]
*  And as I've been warning, I would say with almost 100% certainty—and again, I pray [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=37.5s)]
*  I'm wrong, I pray to God I'm wrong—the terrorists are taking advantage of Joe's open borders, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  and there are terror cells likely in this country plotting, planning, scheming, and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=49.14s)]
*  attacking against our homeland. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=52.7s)]
*  And the blame for that will lie squarely on the shoulders of Joe Biden. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=55.14s)]
*  Sadly over the weekend, our prediction again came true. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=59.58s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=62.5s)]
*  An unvetted illegal immigrant from Egypt with extremist views, now charged with 16 counts [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=64.06s)]
*  of attempted murder after purportedly yelling, Free Palestine, while attempting to burn people [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=69.68s)]
*  alive with homemade incendiary devices. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=74.62s)]
*  His victims, many seriously injured, were part of a group that brings awareness to Israeli [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  hostages still being held inside of Gaza. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=83.7s)]
*  Make no mistake, this was a terrorist attack. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=86.94s)]
*  And this is not the big one I'm warning about. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=90.62s)]
*  That could happen at any point, anytime they're plotting, planning, scheming. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  We have known terrorists in this country, murderers, rapists, known cartel members, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  known gang members, Joe, Kamala, Mayorkas, all let him in unvetted. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=102.66s)]
*  And by the way, this was a deranged individual allowed into our country by Biden, Harris, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=108.38s)]
*  Mayorkas, and then gifted a work permit after he broke our immigration laws. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  This is what I mean when I say Democrats have blood on their hands. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=119.02s)]
*  All those names have blood on their hands. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  In fact, according to the House Homeland Security Committee, pay close attention. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  Biden was president 21 to 24. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=129.5s)]
*  There were more than 50 cases of related, that are related to Islamic terrorism in our [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=132.66000000000003s)]
*  country in 29 U.S. states. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=138.9s)]
*  That did not stop Biden, that did not stop Democrats actually in charge of the swamp [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  from keeping your borders wide open. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=147.82000000000002s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  We have a lot coming up tonight. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  Borders are, Tom Holman will give his first interview on this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=154.74s)]
*  But this isn't just about illegal immigration. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=157.94s)]
*  It is past time for Democrats, the media mob, legacy media mob, to come to terms with the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=160.54s)]
*  political violence from their side of the aisle for years. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=166.66s)]
*  What have we all witnessed? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=171.38s)]
*  What have we chronicled on this program? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=172.78s)]
*  You know, selective, feign, phony, moral outrage from Democrats and the legacy media mob. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=175.06s)]
*  Every day, how many times did they obsess over Charlottesville? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=181.1s)]
*  And they never put it in its proper context. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=185.18s)]
*  They never talked about January 6. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=187.7s)]
*  Many of you will peacefully, patriotically march to the Capitol so your voices will be heard. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=189.78s)]
*  They never talked to the driver of the beast that said, no, Donald Trump never tried to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=196.54000000000002s)]
*  commandeer the vehicle. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=200.46s)]
*  They accused President Trump of inciting violence. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=202.18s)]
*  Biden's DOJ treated angry parents at school board meetings like domestic terrorists. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=205.78s)]
*  They did the same thing with traditional Catholics. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=210.4s)]
*  They went after peaceful anti-abortion protesters. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=212.94s)]
*  They in their case were locked up. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=216.38s)]
*  Remember the elderly grandmother sentenced to years in prison? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=218.38s)]
*  They told us that right-wing extremism was the greatest existential threat to our country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=221.66s)]
*  But as per usual, they were lying or delusional. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=227.7s)]
*  In fact, the extremism has been coming from inside of their own party. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=231.22s)]
*  And to this day, they still don't seem to care. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=235.54s)]
*  Let's take you back circa 2020, the summer of love, violent left-wing riots ripping across [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=238.94s)]
*  this country, killing dozens of Americans, causing billions of property damage. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=245.34s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, cops were pelted with bricks, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=250.78s)]
*  574 riots in total that we categorized as riots and much more violence. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=256.58s)]
*  And here's how top Democrats reacted. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=264.58s)]
*  Kamala Harris said, the rioters, they're not going to stop. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=267.14s)]
*  They shouldn't stop. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=270.26s)]
*  And we're not going to stop supporting them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=272.02s)]
*  So beware. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  Take note. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=275.02000000000004s)]
*  She said that to Stephen Colbert. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=276.02000000000004s)]
*  And then Democrats went out and voted for her. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  Few Democrats had the courage to tell the truth, to condemn even the worst riots in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=280.38s)]
*  2020 that killed two dozen Americans. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=285.5s)]
*  That kind of political violence, all but excused, you know, from the far left. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=289.06s)]
*  And it continued year in and year out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  You have a deranged individual trying to assassinate U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  at his home. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=301.38s)]
*  The doxing of Supreme Court justices. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=302.56s)]
*  President Trump surviving too would be assassins. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=304.96s)]
*  Democrats openly calling for both Trump and Elon Musk to be killed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=308.64s)]
*  Musk's flagship company, Tesla, targeted with domestic terrorism time and time and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=312.68s)]
*  time again. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Dozens of cars, dealerships, charging stations, vandalized, shot at, burned. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  And meanwhile, the behavior from the far left, free Palestine crowd is even worse. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=326.0s)]
*  Guy Benson, I think, put it best. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=330.84s)]
*  He said, if a right wing movement had burned down a governor's mansion, murdered two foreign [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=332.52s)]
*  diplomats, firebombed kids and elderly people at a peaceful protest, in the span of two [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=337.4s)]
*  weeks, what would the coverage look like? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  What sort of national conversation would Democrats be having? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=346.88s)]
*  But the pro-Palestinian crowd? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, they are undeterred. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=352.4s)]
*  And few elected Democrats have ever had the courage to speak out. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=354.64s)]
*  They are afraid of the squad. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=359.24s)]
*  They're afraid of their radical base. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  Just today, so-called pro-Palestine demonstrators storming a stage at an event with the U.S. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=362.84s)]
*  Navy secretary. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  So let me be very clear tonight. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=370.28s)]
*  The Democratic Party will tolerate vile anti-Semitism. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=372.2s)]
*  They will tolerate 574 riots that kill Americans, cause billions in damage and injure thousands [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=377.36s)]
*  of cops, while feigning, you know, selective moral outrage over one riot at a Capitol [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=385.24s)]
*  years ago if their side can excuse it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=394.08s)]
*  You know, if they can use it for political purposes. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  If not, if it's their side, they ignore it, they lie about it, they can lie and make it [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=401.72s)]
*  up when it's about Trump and pretend, you know, to be outraged. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=406.64s)]
*  But it's phony. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=411.18s)]
*  It's fake. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=412.18s)]
*  It's political in nature. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=413.22s)]
*  And frankly, it's despicable. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, the fact that Democrats never stood for two moms at the joint session speech of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=417.42s)]
*  Donald Trump that lost their children because of their open border policies, they couldn't [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=423.14s)]
*  even stand for this young man who had cancer. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=427.62s)]
*  Apparently, the cancer we learned over the weekend came back. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=429.74s)]
*  Our prayers are with that young 13-year-old man. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=432.6s)]
*  They couldn't stand for moms that lost their children. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=436.42s)]
*  Joe Biden, Kamala Mayorkas, they never called. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=439.06s)]
*  Blake and Riley's family, Rachel Moran's family, Jocelyn Nungary's family, the dozens [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=442.1s)]
*  and dozens and dozens and dozens of other families, victims of murder, rape, violent [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=446.56s)]
*  crimes that they caused because of their wide open border policies with no vetting. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeRPg4XUmDg&t=451.68s)]
