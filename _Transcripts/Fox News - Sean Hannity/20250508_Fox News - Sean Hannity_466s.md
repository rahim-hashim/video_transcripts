# 'REAL OLD': Air traffic equipment looks like something from the Smithsonian, Sean Duffy says
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo)
*  All right, you might remember a guy named Pete Buttigieg, also known as Pothole Pete. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was Joe Biden's secretary of transportation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  He liked to bike to work, or at least he liked to have his security detail, drive him a few [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=9.84s)]
*  blocks away from work, take his bike out of the truck, and then ride the rest of the way [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=14.92s)]
*  to work. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=19.78s)]
*  Kind of an image thing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=20.78s)]
*  President Trump is not forgotten. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=22.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=24.04s)]
*  Buttigieg, who has no clue, you know, he drives to work on his bicycle with his, in all fairness, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  with his husband on the back, which is a nice, loving relationship. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=32.28s)]
*  But he didn't have a clue. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=35.84s)]
*  This guy didn't have a clue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=38.12s)]
*  And he's actually a contender for president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=40.18s)]
*  Between him and Crockett, you can have that party. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=42.2s)]
*  All right, it's probably true. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=45.04s)]
*  Pothole Pete wants to be president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=49.96s)]
*  He spent time hitting the podcast circuit, trashing Trump and doge and spewing the same [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=52.04s)]
*  false recycle. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=57.48s)]
*  Talking points about how Republicans that want to cut health care for the poor people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  A complete lie. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=63.08s)]
*  This from the guy who once said that Joe Biden built infrastructure projects as grand and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=64.52s)]
*  critical as the Hoover Dam. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=71.44s)]
*  Turns out it was really just about 60 charging stations for electric vehicles, and he spent [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=73.6s)]
*  a fortune. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=78.92s)]
*  A guy who took two months off after adopting a child, who took a vacation in Portugal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=80.08s)]
*  despite a looming rail strike, and who waited three weeks to visit East Palastine, Ohio, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=84.52s)]
*  only going after Donald Trump made a visit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=90.72s)]
*  And Pete was even warned about the issues facing air travel, the FAA, all the near misses [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=93.48s)]
*  at airports, the shortage of air traffic controllers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=99.28s)]
*  He did nothing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=103.44s)]
*  He left it to his successor, now Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=105.2s)]
*  He's stepping up to the plate after a deep, deep dive just today, announcing a sweeping [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=109.72s)]
*  plan to build six new air traffic control centers, upgrade and standardize technology [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=114.7s)]
*  at airports all across the country, replacing 600 radars and doing it all as quickly as [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=121.32s)]
*  possible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=127.52s)]
*  Anyway, here with more details on all of this is the Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=128.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=133.64s)]
*  You and I had a private conversation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=134.82s)]
*  You told me a couple of things that I think every American needs to be alarmed about, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=136.88s)]
*  and you've been very open about it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=142.04s)]
*  You were open about it today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=143.24s)]
*  Number one, what did, first, what did Pete Buttigieg tell you about this job? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=144.88s)]
*  You did have a conversation with him. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=148.68s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, listen, the prior secretary indicated to me that this was a department [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=150.28s)]
*  that ran itself. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=154.92s)]
*  And, you know, when he was a secretary, I'm not sure that he actually showed up to the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=155.92s)]
*  office. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=159.28s)]
*  Most of the office didn't come into work. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=160.28s)]
*  And so, as I've been here, this is my 100th day, Sean, I've been here for 100 days. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=162.64s)]
*  And this is more than a full-time job. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=167.32s)]
*  You have to show up. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=169.28s)]
*  You have to work 12, 16 hours a day to do this job. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=170.28s)]
*  And if you don't come, things don't happen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=172.52s)]
*  And for Pete Buttigieg, when you don't show up and you get multiple warnings from watchdog [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=175.16s)]
*  groups that say, hey, listen, the air traffic control system is failing, you have to take [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=179.24s)]
*  action, they did absolutely nothing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=184.0s)]
*  The Biden administration, remember this, Sean, they spent $1.2 trillion on infrastructure [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  in America. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=191.68s)]
*  $1.2 trillion. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=192.68s)]
*  None of it went to fix the air traffic control system, which is a crumbling infrastructure, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=194.68s)]
*  key infrastructure in this country. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=199.44s)]
*  They didn't fix it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=201.36s)]
*  And so now we've been left with a problem, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  We had the DCA air crash. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  We then have had the Newark outage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=206.24s)]
*  And we have said in the Trump administration, listen, we don't pass problems off to the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=209.08s)]
*  next administration. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=212.96s)]
*  We actually fix problems. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=213.96s)]
*  We take hard problems and we make them better. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=214.96s)]
*  And so today we rolled out the most historic aviation plan that has been ever laid out [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  in the history of man. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=224.24s)]
*  We are going to rebuild every part, every aspect of the air traffic control system. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  So it's going to be, as you played the clip, it's going to be radios, radar, a whole infrastructure [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=231.04s)]
*  of telecom, all the front facing and back office side of telecommunication for air traffic [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=235.94s)]
*  controllers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=243.0s)]
*  They're going to have a brand new system. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=244.0s)]
*  But here's what's key. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=245.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=246.56s)]
*  This would only take. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=247.56s)]
*  Oh, go ahead. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=248.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=249.56s)]
*  I was going to say this would only take 10 or 15 years. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=250.56s)]
*  We can do this, Sean, in three or four years, fix this system. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=252.24s)]
*  But we need Congress to give us all the money up front. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=256.04s)]
*  And then we need them to waive a lot of the requirements for permitting. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  If they do that for us, we can actually build this really quick and make sure our skies [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=262.58s)]
*  are still the safest in the world. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=267.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=269.44s)]
*  Can you explain the shortage of air traffic controllers that you inherited? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=270.44s)]
*  How many are we short? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=275.6s)]
*  Because that is vital to air safety. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=278.44s)]
*  And explain how antiquated the technology is at the centers and at these airports, especially [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=281.48s)]
*  the busiest airports around the country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=288.24s)]
*  So let's start with the last question first. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=291.68s)]
*  So the systems were developed when Elvis was a star. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=293.48s)]
*  Rolling Stones were a star. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  When Duran Duran was making music. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=299.24s)]
*  I mean, we go back to the 60s and 70s. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=300.6s)]
*  We laid out a lot of the infrastructure. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  It looks like it was from, remember the movie War Games or Apollo 13? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=304.64s)]
*  It looks like equipment from the movie sets for those movies. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=307.96s)]
*  It looks like we got the infrastructure from the Smithsonian, but it's not. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  It's the equipment that we use in American air traffic control towers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=316.68s)]
*  Really, really old. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=319.84s)]
*  It all has to be brand new state of the art. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  And with regard to air traffic controllers, we're three thousand controllers short. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  They didn't stand up the school during COVID. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  And as controllers were retiring, they didn't have a pipeline of new controllers coming [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=331.08s)]
*  in through the academy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=335.46s)]
*  So we've done two things. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=336.46s)]
*  Air traffic controllers who can retire after 25 years of service, we're going to pay them [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  a bonus. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=342.29999999999995s)]
*  We're going to ask them to stay past their retirement date to serve their country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  I think we get a lot of controllers to do that. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=347.7s)]
*  But then we're going to expand the pipeline at our academy in Oklahoma City to get the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=350.29999999999995s)]
*  best and the brightest air traffic controllers through that system and trained up. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=354.34s)]
*  And then, you know, I think it's going to take us a year to three years to get fully [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=359.65999999999997s)]
*  staffed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=363.5s)]
*  Here's an example. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=364.5s)]
*  I can take one of the most complicated air systems, say like DC, the Potomac Traycon [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=365.54s)]
*  around Washington, D.C., take a controller from there and move them to New York. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=370.82s)]
*  It takes them a year to get trained up on that airspace. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=374.88s)]
*  So you just can't move controllers around. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=377.14s)]
*  They have to be trained in the airspace in which they work. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=379.66s)]
*  And that takes time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=382.7s)]
*  And so we're navigating the mess that was left to us. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=383.7s)]
*  We're hiring more air traffic controllers. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=386.62s)]
*  We're fixing the system. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=388.68s)]
*  Let me ask this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=389.68s)]
*  But again, it's going to take time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=390.68s)]
*  Can you bring? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=392.6s)]
*  I'm almost out of time. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=393.6s)]
*  This is too critical and vital. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=394.70000000000005s)]
*  Can you bring back air traffic controllers that my understanding is they are forced to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=396.16s)]
*  retire in their 50s? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=401.28000000000003s)]

*  I can bring them back, yes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=411.12s)]
*  They might have to do some training, but we can bring those controllers who have retired, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=412.5s)]
*  bring them back into the system. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=416.54s)]
*  They're forced to retire at 56. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  I can approve them to stay until 60. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=419.56s)]
*  Everything is on the deck. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zidh0ZA65uo&t=422.76000000000005s)]
