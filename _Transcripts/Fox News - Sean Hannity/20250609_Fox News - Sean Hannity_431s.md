# Fox News crew captures anti-ICE rioters hurling firecrackers
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y)
*  All right, we continue our breaking news coverage of the situation that is unfolding in real time in Los Angeles tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Rioters, police are starting to clash. Our very own Bill Molusian is live on the ground in Los Angeles, in the Southland, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=6.0s)]
*  with the very latest. Things are getting very tense there, Bill. What's going on? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=13.0s)]
*  Yeah, they are, Sean. We're a few blocks away from where we came to you with our last live shot about 20 minutes ago. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=19.0s)]
*  LAPD continuing to push these agitators out of the state. Let me step out, give you a look here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=24.0s)]
*  So this is that LAPD skirmish line we showed you about 20 minutes ago. They're still trying to push these protesters. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=29.0s)]
*  You just heard a foam round get shot off right there. Someone throwing bottle right there. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=34.0s)]
*  All right, so people are throwing water bottles now, so police are going to be a little bit more antsy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=38.0s)]
*  But as Tommy pans through the crowd as they're pushing them back, you'll notice it's almost all foreign flags, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=42.0s)]
*  signs that say F ice release everybody. We're going to walk up ahead a little bit more here. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=47.0s)]
*  But this has been this constant game of cat and mouse, Sean, and it's getting more and more tense. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=52.0s)]
*  It feels like a pressure cooker. You can feel the tension building. The sun is starting to go down. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=57.0s)]
*  Some of those agitators are out. There's a lot of people, if we pan the faces in the crowd that have like gas masks on, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=62.0s)]
*  that have helmets on, someone just threw a firecracker. Watch out, firecracker is going to go off. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=67.0s)]
*  It's going to go off any. Yep, there we go. So that's the point, right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=72.0s)]
*  These agitators are going to start throwing things at police. That's going to put police on edge. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=77.0s)]
*  Police are going to respond with their nonlethal rounds. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=81.0s)]
*  When you take a look at these LAPD officers and you see the green neon slings on their shoulders, those are their foam launchers or their rubber bullets. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=84.0s)]
*  Those are their nonlethal guns. But Sean, we felt the night was going to head this way, and it certainly looks like it is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=90.0s)]
*  We're getting more of those agitators, and they always throw stuff from the back of the crowd. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=97.0s)]
*  They're not the ones who are going to be seen by LAPD. They chuck something and then they run off. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=101.0s)]
*  In that case, it was a firework that landed about five feet away from us right underneath an LAPD car. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=105.0s)]
*  So that's going to put these. One second, guys. Tommy, you got to step back real quick. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=111.0s)]
*  Again, these officers just want to make sure we're in a safe location. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=117.0s)]
*  But someone just threw a stick at LAPD. That's not going to go over well. That just happened right in front of us here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=122.0s)]
*  They just responded with a foam round, it looks like. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=129.0s)]
*  So as we continue to follow LAPD from their perspective behind their skirmish line, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=132.0s)]
*  watching some of these agitators in front of them, it's getting a little bit more violent, Sean. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=138.0s)]
*  Nothing extreme or severe yet. Haven't seen any rocks or stones. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=144.0s)]
*  But I will tell you, a couple blocks behind us, we watched an LAPD officer pull two metal baseball bats out of bushes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=148.0s)]
*  They had apparently been stashed there by some of the agitators before they got pushed out of the area. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=155.0s)]
*  He pulled those bats out and showed them to another firecracker door right here, Tommy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=160.0s)]
*  It's going to go off by these black SUVs. Watch out. It's going to go off here in a second. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=163.0s)]
*  Yep. So again, people are launching fireworks. We've seen them launching water bottles. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=167.0s)]
*  Ellie, more fireworks, unless that was a flashbang. It's hard to tell. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=173.0s)]
*  You say that's a firecracker. It looked like a bottle rocket the way it shot out underneath that car. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=178.0s)]
*  I mean, I used to be a fireworks nut. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard for me to tell. They're pretty small. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=184.0s)]
*  They look like the size of like, I don't know, like a USB drive when they're in the air and their sparks coming out of them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=192.0s)]
*  So I'm not sure what they are. But I mean, just in the last few minutes, we've seen what three of those get launched at police before you came to us live. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=199.0s)]
*  They were having more bottles thrown at them. And again, it's almost all foreign flags in these crowd. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=206.0s)]
*  There's one partial US flag mixed in with other foreign flags here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=211.0s)]
*  But I'm getting the sense that some of these agitators are starting to come out, Sean. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=215.0s)]
*  It's no longer people. It definitely feels like a different crowd than we had a few hours ago. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=220.0s)]
*  Most of those folks were fairly peaceful. They were chanting. They were holding up signs perfectly fine. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=225.0s)]
*  First Amendment say whatever they want. But once we start seeing what we're happening, what's happening here with these firecrackers, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=230.0s)]
*  you know, yesterday LAPD had horses down here and people were throwing fireworks at the horses. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=237.0s)]
*  A few of them reportedly got injured, according to LAPD. Sounds like a few more foam rounds just went off. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=243.0s)]
*  Crowd is starting to kind of run away a little bit now. Not sure what happened on the other side of this bus. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=249.0s)]
*  But again, you know, I've covered L.A. for a long time. I've covered a lot of these riots, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=255.0s)]
*  whether it be George Floyd or Lakers or Dodger celebrations or this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=260.0s)]
*  And you kind of get to learn what the agitators look like. And I'm seeing a decent amount of them out here right now. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=264.0s)]
*  Always dressed in black, always with face coverings, not holding any signs. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=270.0s)]
*  And as I told you earlier, Sean, a lot of people were showing up here and they were being given earplugs, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=274.0s)]
*  gas masks, water bottles, not to drink. A lot of those water bottles are being thrown. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=281.0s)]
*  So, you know, unfortunately, it looks like we might be heading for another night of things crossing the line here in Los Angeles. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=286.0s)]
*  And as we're waiting for apparently more National Guard and more U.S. Marines to head down here to Los Angeles, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=294.0s)]
*  we're not seeing any of them in the streets. The National Guard, they're basically sitting around federal buildings helping protect them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=300.0s)]
*  They're not out in the streets pushing these protesters back. This is all the locals. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=306.0s)]
*  Everything you're looking at in front of us right now is LAPD. It's not California Highway Patrol. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=310.0s)]
*  The L.A. Sheriff's Department is behind us. This is all LAPD. And we heard the chief of LAPD say last night, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=315.0s)]
*  they're a bit overwhelmed. And, you know, that's once these agitators come out in huge numbers [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=321.0s)]
*  and LAPD has to constantly respond to different areas. They reported that some of these people were using radios to communicate with each other last night [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=327.0s)]
*  to report law enforcement movements. So it's complicated for law enforcement as well. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=334.0s)]
*  But this is essentially the game that gets played all night long here. This is the main protest crowd. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=338.0s)]
*  Police will try to push them back. They kind of melt away like water, will go down another alley, reemerge somewhere else. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=345.0s)]
*  LAPD will get a radio call, have to go respond to them. And every now and then you'll have these 10, 15 minute spurts where it's quiet. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=351.0s)]
*  And then people will start throwing water bottles and fireworks again, Sean. But I mean, you're seeing it in front of us, a lot of foreign flags [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=358.0s)]
*  and certainly seeming to be kind of a different crowd than what we saw a few hours ago earlier this evening. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=364.0s)]
*  Definitely you can feel the tension building. You can definitely feel like as the sun is about to go down here, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=370.0s)]
*  we could be in for another rough night here in Los Angeles, Sean. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=376.0s)]
*  It's kind of scary. Earplugs, gas masks, water bottles to hurl at cops, some of them frozen. Bats being hidden, fireworks going off. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=381.0s)]
*  And you're reporting, you know, the interesting thing, Bill, is you've been there from the beginning. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=390.0s)]
*  You were at the border as Democrats and the president at the time, Biden and Mayorkas and Kamala Harris and other Democrats, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=394.0s)]
*  either silent or complicit, all telling the American people the border's closed, border's secure, all leading to this couple with sanctuary city, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=404.0s)]
*  sanctuary state policies. But we'll come back to you in a minute, Bill Molluskian on the ground in the Southland in Los Angeles tonight. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn-Yv2h5_Y&t=411.0s)]
