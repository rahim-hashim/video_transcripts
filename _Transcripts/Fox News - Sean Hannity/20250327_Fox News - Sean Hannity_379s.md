# Kayleigh McEnany: Criminal illegal aliens face justice for the first time in years
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. We move on to this violent criminal illegal aliens [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=0.0s)]
*  finally facing justice for the first time in years. And few people know that better than [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=7.68s)]
*  Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, who witnessed three years of President Biden's complete in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  action. Well, there's a new sheriff in town, President Trump. And today, Youngkin was instrumental [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=18.32s)]
*  in assisting the successful law enforcement operation against MS 13. Also with Trump's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=24.479999999999997s)]
*  backing, Youngkin is eliminating DEI at public universities around the Commonwealth, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=30.0s)]
*  and he's appointing boards of visitors to make sure that the school stays on track for years [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=35.04s)]
*  to come, long beyond the one term he can stay in office as Virginia Governor. Now, he's also [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  earned a pretty interesting nickname, Vito Corleone, because he just vetoed over 150 bills [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=45.36s)]
*  that far leftist passed through the Democrat controlled Senate and Legislature, as many users [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=52.88s)]
*  on X like to say, quote, This is the way. Joining us now with more Governor Glenn Youngkin, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Governor Youngkin, let's start with that operation today. There's this interagency [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  task force. It's the first of its kind, the FBI, the DOJ, you as governor of Virginia. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=71.28s)]
*  And I want to put up the results, just a few weeks of this task force that you've been working with. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=77.12s)]
*  And here are the results just in your state. 28 MS 13 members arrested, 19 TDA, 27 TOC, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=81.44s)]
*  that's trans organized crime, and seven other gang members. Just in a few weeks, you have done [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  this. You were sworn in January 15th, 2022. You had three years under President Joe Biden's leadership. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  Now that's switched. And in two months, you've accomplished this. What's the difference between [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=102.64s)]
*  working with Biden for three years and Trump for two months? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=106.96s)]
*  Well, Kayleigh, you said it perfectly. For three years, I've been declaring that Virginia is not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  a sanctuary state and President Biden, with his open border policies, turned America into a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  sanctuary country. Well, with President Trump's leadership and the great group of appointees that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=123.28s)]
*  have been confirmed, we went to work. And today, this collaboration between state police, our [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  Department of Corrections, Homeland Security, the FBI, ICE, and lots of folks from the U.S. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=136.32s)]
*  Attorney's Office, we went to work and they brought down one of the top MS 13 operatives [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=142.72s)]
*  in America. And let me tell you, today, Virginia is safer, America is safer, and nowhere is there [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=149.6s)]
*  sanctuary for these violent, illegal immigrants. And it has been collaboration, Kayleigh, that I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=157.04s)]
*  have never seen before, rooms full of professionals who are going to work. And I'll tell you, on top [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=162.32s)]
*  of all of the gang members, we've also had about 300 violent, illegal immigrants that have been [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=168.64s)]
*  arrested, ready for deportation as well. This is how state and federal government should work. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  I didn't have it for three years. And as soon as President Trump showed up, we went to work and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=180.48s)]
*  we're making America and Virginia safer. So they're calling you Vito Corleone, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=185.36s)]
*  from The Godfather. I heard one person call you the killer of leftist dreams because you vetoed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=192.24s)]
*  so many bills, in fact, 159 vetoed bills this week, some of them really bad, like bills that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=198.56s)]
*  would have prevented praying in front of abortion clinics. What are you doing down there in Virginia? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=205.68s)]
*  It sounds like some pretty radical things are coming to your desk. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=211.04s)]
*  Well, one might say that it's not personal, it's only business. But the reality is, it is personal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  It's personal for Virginians. Over the course of the last three years, Virginia has become the top [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=223.76s)]
*  state in America for business. We have had massive in-migration for the first time in over a decade. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=228.56s)]
*  We have seen the excellence restored in education in our schools. We just had the leading decrease [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=235.84s)]
*  in chronic absenteeism in the country from our schools, where our kids are now back in the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=243.12s)]
*  classroom like never before. We are working so hard to make sure that we've reduced over 35 percent [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=247.76s)]
*  the murders in Virginia. The bottom line is, it's working. And I'm not about to let the progressive [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=254.0s)]
*  left send me a bunch of bills because we're one seat down in both houses of our Senate [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=260.96s)]
*  and our House of Delegates, bills that are bad for business, bad for families, and on top of that, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=265.84s)]
*  want to put criminals in front of victims and, most importantly, take us back to where we were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=272.08s)]
*  before I became governor. And so, yes, I have a big box of pens. We have been using them frequently, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=277.76s)]
*  and I'll make sure that, yes, the 157 vetoes that I had this year are added to the ones from last [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=284.64s)]
*  year. I think I'm over 400 vetoes since I've been governor. But as I said, this is what we have to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=290.32s)]
*  do in order to protect Virginia from moving backwards and make sure we continue to move [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=295.76s)]
*  forward as being the best state in America to live, work and raise a family. Yeah, you hold the veto [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=300.8s)]
*  record there in the Commonwealth, as I understand it. One last question, and I only have a few [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  moments, but on DEI, President Trump instructed to get DEI out of our schools. You are one of the few [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=310.96s)]
*  governors, I would note, who took this to task and said, I'm doing this right away. You got DEI [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=317.04s)]
*  out of UVA, VCU, Longwood, Radford and Virginia Community College. What was so insidious about [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=322.16s)]
*  DEI that you said, it's time to just get this out and get it out immediately? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=329.12s)]
*  Well, first, we had Virginia Tech to that list as well. And so we are seeing all of our colleges [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  and universities where DEI has been embedded not just for years, but for decades. And DEI is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  dead in Virginia. We're going to work. And I'll tell you, the most important thing is that Virginians [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=346.32s)]
*  elect Winsome Earl Sears governor this year. So the same kinds of collaboration with the federal [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=350.96s)]
*  government can continue and Virginia can continue to soar and not go backwards. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, she is fierce. That would be quite a successor there. Governor Glenn Youngkin, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=362.0s)]
*  talk to you soon. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjyTrtqPiN8&t=365.92s)]
