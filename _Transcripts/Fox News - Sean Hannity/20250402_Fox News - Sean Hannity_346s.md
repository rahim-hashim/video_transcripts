# Can the 'rogue judges' be stopped?
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU)
*  Committee Chairman Jim Jordan is urging the Appropriations Committee to use, you know, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=0.0s)]
*  finding bills to limit the ability of these rogue justices to misuse nationwide injunctions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=5.12s)]
*  Anyway, here with more. Chairman, Jim Jordan is with us. Mr. Chairman, to me it's just an extension [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=11.52s)]
*  of lawfare. To me this is what they can't get done at the ballot box, what they can't get done [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=18.0s)]
*  legislatively. They go out judge picking, they find the right judge and they get their injunction [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=23.52s)]
*  and here we go. Yeah, it's a fundamental question, Sean. Who gets to decide? The 77 million people who [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=29.04s)]
*  showed up on election day voted for President Trump, knew what he said he was going to do, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=36.0s)]
*  he's now doing that. Do they get to decide? We the people? Or is it some district judge, some [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=39.04s)]
*  un-elected district judge who gets to make the call? And that's just not how our system works. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=43.84s)]
*  And then when you think about it, it's an un-elected district judge who gets to make the call [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=49.36s)]
*  for the entire country right now. And so we have legislation just like Senator Grassley is going to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=53.84s)]
*  have in the Senate. We have legislation sponsored by Representative Issa, which would say the same [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=58.48s)]
*  thing. District judge, if you have a ruling, an injunction, it applies to the parties in the case [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=62.72s)]
*  in that respective jurisdiction. It doesn't apply nationwide. We're also looking at the appropriations [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=67.84s)]
*  process and we're doing oversight like we did today at that hearing. All three levers we have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=73.52s)]
*  in the House, in the Congress to put pressure on the, on the judicial branch to do it the right way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=78.96s)]
*  Okay. Let's talk about what you think Congress can do. And if in fact that the House and the Senate [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=84.64s)]
*  can come up with a bill they agree with, okay, that means this would all go away, wouldn't it? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=91.44s)]
*  Yeah, we got to get it passed in the Senate. We, I think we can pass it in the House. We got, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  we got the majority there. Of course in the Senate to pass legislation, you got the 60 vote hurdle. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=101.84s)]
*  You need the super majority, but maybe again, we've had justices like Justice Kagan who've said, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=106.4s)]
*  that this shouldn't be the case where one district judge can apply an injunction that, that, that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  impacts the entire country. So you even have justices on the left who've said this is a problem. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  So maybe we can get to 60, get this legislation passed, but we should continue to do oversight, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=124.08s)]
*  continue to highlight these decisions that seem so ridiculous. Like Judge Boesberg saying, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  bring the bad guys back to the country. Terrorists, gang members, trendy Aragwa gang members who've [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=135.04s)]
*  done terrible things, bring them back. That makes no sense. So highlight that as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=141.04s)]
*  And finally, look at the appropriations process, the power of the purse to impact this as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=145.84s)]
*  Okay. So there was a lot of talk about either one bill, one big, beautiful bill or two bills [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=152.16s)]
*  to get the president's agenda across the finish line. We have new developments tonight, and that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  is that as Senate budget chair, Lindsey Graham believes he does not need the approval or permission [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  and there is precedent for this of the Senate parliamentarian to get reconciliation passed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=170.72s)]
*  What is the status on that? Yeah. I mean, I think the American people think, you know, the people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=177.92s)]
*  they elect should be in control, not some parliamentarian determining what you can and can't do [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=184.0s)]
*  as a member of the United States Senate, as a member of the United States Congress. So I think [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=188.72s)]
*  Senator Graham is correct. The Senate has a unique set of rules. I'm not as familiar with them as we [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=192.64s)]
*  are the House rules, but if he thinks that can happen, I think the American people agree. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=197.28s)]
*  They elected the senators. They didn't elect some parliamentarian. Ultimately, the senators are in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=201.52s)]
*  charge. And if they can determine how to get this done over there, how to navigate through the rules [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=206.32s)]
*  they have and get the product that the president campaigned on and the American people want [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=211.36s)]
*  delivered, then I say go right ahead. Okay. A lot of craziness in the House right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=215.36s)]
*  What do you make of Jamie Raskin demanding that deported criminal illegal gang members come home? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm all in favor if they live with him with an ankle bracelet or Jasmine Crockett, you know, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  hyperventilating about protecting the institution of the judiciary, but she wanted to impeach [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito. Who is the leader of the Democrats in the House right now? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=239.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's obviously Hakeem Jeffries. Well, maybe not obviously, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=247.36s)]
*  but that's that's that's their leader. I do think you're right, Sean. Remember, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=251.36s)]
*  Chuck Schumer stood on the steps of the United States Supreme Court and said to Justice Kavanaugh [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  and Justices Gorsuch that you will face the whirlwind if you don't rule the way the left [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=259.04s)]
*  wanted them to rule on the case pending in front of the court. So and then they've also [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=263.52000000000004s)]
*  introduced legislation to pack the court and they've also introduced legislation to impeach [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=267.92s)]
*  Supreme Court justice. And now they're calling us out when we can point to a judge like Judge [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=273.04s)]
*  Boasberg who said turn the plane around, bring the bad guys back. These these were bad people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=277.6s)]
*  They weren't boy scouts. They were here illegally and did bad things in their native country [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  and here in the United States. And he said turn the plane around and then you couple all that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  with the fact that Judge Boasberg is the same judge who was on the FISA court, the same judge [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=292.0s)]
*  who said to Kevin Kleinsmith, the guy who lied to the FISA court when they got the warrants to spy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=296.56s)]
*  on President Trump's campaign, he gave that guy what the Wall Street Journal said was a slap on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=300.88s)]
*  the wrist for lying to the court, the secret court. That's this judge. He does this ruling and now [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=305.44s)]
*  he gets assigned the Hegseth case and he's going to get to decide who the Secretary of State can [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=312.88s)]
*  talk to and how he has to do it. Come on. Come on. The American people I think see through all that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=317.68s)]
*  and that's why we're doing the work we're doing in the House and Senator Grassley and the Senators [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=323.76s)]
*  are doing the work they're doing in the Senate. All right, Jim Jordan as always. Thank you. We [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hg1So0QNxU&t=327.92s)]
