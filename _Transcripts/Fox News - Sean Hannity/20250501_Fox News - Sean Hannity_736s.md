# 'NO MILITARY SOLUTION': Marco Rubio discusses status of peace deals in Russia-Ukraine war
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8)
*  But first, a major announcement from the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Walz has been nominated now to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to the United [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=2.92s)]
*  Nations. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=7.72s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio will now fill in as Donald Trump's national security advisor [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=8.72s)]
*  while continuing to lead the State Department. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=15.4s)]
*  Now, in case you're keeping track, this means that Secretary of State Rubio is now [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  the secretary of state, the national security advisor, the acting USAID administrator and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  the acting archivist. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=27.04s)]
*  I mean, he's got a lot. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=28.96s)]
*  Now, an ex-vice president, J.D. Vance, actually was very funny, remarking, quote, I think [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=29.96s)]
*  he could take on a bit more. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=35.6s)]
*  If only there was a job opening for a devout Catholic. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=37.48s)]
*  When does conclave start? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  I think the 7th, here now with more, is Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, you got to admit, that was pretty funny. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=46.2s)]
*  I like that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=49.32s)]
*  Well, you know, we thought about it, but you have to, it's an unmarried Catholic male. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=50.32s)]
*  You don't have to be a priest. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=53.92s)]
*  People don't know that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=55.72s)]
*  An unmarried Catholic male can be Pope, but I got married and I'm happily married, so [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=56.72s)]
*  I guess I'll miss out on that one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=62.04s)]
*  I know you are. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=63.04s)]
*  And by the way, you have a great, you've got a great family and your son's a great football [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  player and I know you're very proud and you should be. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=67.28s)]
*  Look, we've been friends a long time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=70.0s)]
*  Really, and I'm happy for Mike Waltz, by the way, I think he'll be a great U.N. ambassador [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=72.56s)]
*  and we need one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  And you, your wheelhouse has always been foreign policy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  I've known you forever. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=82.64s)]
*  This is your passion, your heart is here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=84.96s)]
*  These are consequential times. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  We've got Europe, we've got Russia, Ukraine, we've got the Middle East, we have Iran, and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=88.44s)]
*  then we have this, you know, our number one geopolitical foe, China. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Let's start in Europe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=96.44s)]
*  Let's start with Putin. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=97.44s)]
*  You said this week may be the deciding week for him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=98.72s)]
*  Clearly, the minerals deal yesterday was a big win for the president and the White House. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=103.0s)]
*  Where do we stand with Putin? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=107.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's remind everybody, this is not our war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is a war that started under Joe Biden. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=112.28s)]
*  For three years it went on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=114.56s)]
*  They've made no effort to sort of bring it to a conclusion. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=115.68s)]
*  And it's a war that has no military solution. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=117.92s)]
*  In essence, Putin can't take all of Ukraine. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=119.72s)]
*  Ukraine can't push the Russians all the way back to where they were in 2014. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=122.84s)]
*  And so the question here is, who's the only leader in the world that can talk to both sides [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=127.0s)]
*  and hopefully bring him to a deal? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's President Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=132.72s)]
*  And that's what he's tried to do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=133.72s)]
*  For 100 days, he has done efforts to bring about peace, to end the killing, to end the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=134.76s)]
*  dying, to end the destruction. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=139.28s)]
*  You know, that Ukraine, it's going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=141.2s)]
*  that country. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=144.2s)]
*  And so the president's triedâ€”look, we've gotten closer. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=145.44s)]
*  For the first time, you know, we haven't known this for three years, we kind of can [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=149.16s)]
*  see what it would take for Ukraine to stop. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  We can see what it would take for the Russians to stop. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  The problem is, those two positions are still a little far apart. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=158.42s)]
*  And look, we're not going to give up on it in the sense that we're not going to be ready [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=162.72s)]
*  to help if we can. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=166.3s)]
*  But there does come a point where the president has to decide how much more time at the highest [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=167.68s)]
*  levels of our government do you dedicate it, when maybe one of the two sides or both aren't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=171.86s)]
*  really close enough, when we've got so manyâ€”I would argue even more important issues going [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=175.88s)]
*  on around the world. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  Not that a war in Ukraine is not important, but I would say what's happening with China [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=181.24s)]
*  is more important in the long term for the future of the world, obviously Iran's nuclear [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  ambition, you know, all these other things that we have going on. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=189.16s)]
*  So at some point in time, it either has to be something that can happen, we'll need [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=192.28s)]
*  to move on. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  What's the decision the president will have to make? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well, I will say this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  The consequences are really dire in every situation that you're referring to. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  Let me go back to Putin for one more second. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the mineral deal, I don't think we can underâ€”I don't think we can overstate [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=209.26s)]
*  how important that's going to be for Ukraine's security, the relationship they will have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  now moving forward with the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=218.94s)]
*  That's a big part of the puzzle. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=220.61999999999998s)]
*  It's important, I think, for people to understand, in the four years when Donald Trump was president, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=222.77999999999997s)]
*  in 2017, till he left office in 2021, no problems with Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=227.1s)]
*  But in 2014, 11 years ago, that's when Crimea was annexed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=234.14s)]
*  When Joe Biden was president and Putin was amassing troops on the border and military [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=239.06s)]
*  equipment on the border, he's asked, well, what happens if he invades? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=243.82s)]
*  Of course he was going to invade. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=246.94s)]
*  He said, well, it depends if it's a minor incursion. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=248.42s)]
*  Nobody ever dared to pick up a phone and even attempt or try to stop it from happening. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=252.14s)]
*  That to me is unconscionable. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=258.58s)]
*  In your heart, do you feel like you're closed? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=261.62s)]
*  I mean, you're in the middle of this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=263.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you gave everybody that lesson, because that's not like it did happen in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  2014 under President Obama. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=270.06s)]
*  But during that time, the Obama administration refused to provide the Ukrainians any military [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=272.14s)]
*  weapons. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=277.46s)]
*  They gave them blankets and sheets and towels and you know, but they wouldn't give them [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=278.46s)]
*  weapons. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=282.02s)]
*  Donald Trump, when he was president the first time, provided them the weapons that actually [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=283.02s)]
*  helped stop the Russian tanks from taking Kiev, even when he was no longer in the White [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  House a few years later. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=291.29999999999995s)]
*  This invasion would have never happened if Donald Trump were in the White House. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=292.74s)]
*  But it did. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=296.14s)]
*  It happened after Joe Biden. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=297.14s)]
*  It happened just a few months after the fiasco in Afghanistan. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=298.14s)]
*  And I think everyone realizes Putin saw that and said, now's my time to go. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  I have a weak president under Joe Biden. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=305.7s)]
*  And he went. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=307.72s)]
*  And this war dragged on for three years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=308.72s)]
*  Look, you ask how close we are. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=310.44000000000005s)]
*  I think we know where Ukraine is and we know where Russia is right now and where Putin [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=312.12s)]
*  is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  They're still far apart. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  They're closer, but they're still far apart. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=318.20000000000005s)]
*  And it's going to take a real breakthrough here very soon to make this possible. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=320.92s)]
*  Or I think the president is going to have to make a decision about how much more time [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=324.74s)]
*  we're going to dedicate to this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=327.8s)]
*  And you're right about the minerals deal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=329.3s)]
*  It's good for America, because we've invested a lot of money in this war. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=330.86s)]
*  It's also good for Ukraine, because it's going to help them be able to develop their economy [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=334.36s)]
*  and rebuild when this war ends. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, they're going to need a lot of money to rebuild. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=340.32s)]
*  They are. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  OK, let's move to the Middle East. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  And let's move to what happens in Gaza. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  It can no longer remain a launching pad for their missiles, Hamas missiles, to be fired [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=347.48s)]
*  into Israel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=352.24s)]
*  That we agree on. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=353.68s)]
*  I know the president has said, and you have said, and Steve Witkoff has said, everybody [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=354.68s)]
*  has said, the Iranians cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  The only reason they're close is because Joe Biden put a blind eye towards the sanctions [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=362.3s)]
*  that were bankrupting Iran, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=366.74s)]
*  However, they are closer than they have ever been. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=369.74s)]
*  To me, a deal with Iran would have to include the following. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=372.86s)]
*  Their enrichment would have to be stopped. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=377.22s)]
*  Their facilities shut down by Americans. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=379.14s)]
*  We would need anywhere, anyplace, any time, American inspectors, not international inspectors. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=382.26s)]
*  Why in my heart of hearts do I not believe that the Muslims of Iran would ever agree [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  to that? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=392.1s)]
*  And do you agree that those should be the conditions? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=393.1s)]
*  If Iran wants a peaceful, civil nuclear program, meaning they want nuclear power plants, like [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=395.9s)]
*  other countries in the world have, there's a way to do it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  And that is, you build the reactors and you import enriched uranium to fuel those reactors. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=405.14s)]
*  That's how dozens of countries around the world do it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=410.54s)]
*  The only countries in the world that enrich uranium are the ones that have nuclear weapons. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=413.48s)]
*  Iran is atâ€”they're claiming they don't want a weapon, but they would beâ€”they're [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=418.14s)]
*  basically asking us to be the only non-weapon country in the world that's enriching uranium. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=421.26000000000005s)]
*  And the level at which they enrich it is really not relevant, per se, because really, if you [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=426.38000000000005s)]
*  have the ability to enrich at 3.67 percent, it only takes a few weeks to get to 20 percent [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=430.54s)]
*  and then 60 percent and then the 80 and 90 percent that you need for a weapon. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=436.26000000000005s)]
*  And so that really is the path forward here. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=440.42s)]
*  Iran simply needs to say, we've agreed to no longer enrich. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  We're going to have reactors because we want nuclear energy, and we're going to import [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=446.38000000000005s)]
*  enriched uranium. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=449.36s)]
*  This is an opportunity for them if they take it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=450.54s)]
*  And this is the best opportunity they're going to have. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=453.12s)]
*  President Trump is a president of peace. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't want a war. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't want conflict. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=458.14000000000004s)]
*  None of us do. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  And there's a path forward here. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=460.14000000000004s)]
*  But what cannot happen is to live in a world where Iran has a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=462.06s)]
*  The path forward has been given to them, and now it's a matter of whether or not they're [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  going to take it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=470.3s)]
*  And the president was very, very clear. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=471.3s)]
*  He would leave the effort to stop them from ever achieving that nuclear weapon. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=473.04s)]
*  And that would mean that statement was obvious in terms of that he would use military force [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=477.06s)]
*  to destroy those facilities. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=482.38s)]
*  We have the capacity, obviously, to do it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=483.94s)]
*  But back to this question, would we need American inspectors and American scientists to shut [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=486.42s)]
*  it down? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=491.44s)]
*  And would that have to be part of the deal? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=492.74s)]
*  And anywhere, any place, any time, American inspectors, would they have to agree to that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=494.9s)]
*  in your mind? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=498.9s)]
*  I think you would have to allow Americans as part of you can send, you know, maybe there [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=499.9s)]
*  will be French inspectors, there'll be Italian inspectors, there'll be Saudis, whoever. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=502.98s)]
*  I think you cannot basically say we will not allow any Americans. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=506.88s)]
*  You also have to make sure, if you really want to prevent a nuclear program, and you're [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=510.44s)]
*  not building a nuclear weapon, then you should open all your facilities. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=514.48s)]
*  You know, one of the failures of the Bidenâ€”I'm sorry, of the Obama nuclear deal with Iran [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=517.8s)]
*  is that you could not inspect military sites well. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=522.66s)]
*  If you're making nuclear weapons, you would probably make them on a military site. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=526.38s)]
*  And by the way, it's been known and discovered that in the past, Iran has had a secret nuclear [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  program that it did not disclose to the world. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=534.76s)]
*  So I think if in fact Iran likes to say they're not interested in nuclear weapons, they like [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=537.32s)]
*  to say all they want is peaceful nuclear energy, then they should not be afraid of inspections [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  by inspectors of any kind, including Americans. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=547.4s)]
*  And look, there's a win here for Iran, okay? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=550.7s)]
*  They can actually have real economic development, can have real investment in their country, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=552.82s)]
*  but they have to walk away from sponsoring terrorists, they have to walk away from helping [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=557.2s)]
*  the Houthis, they have to walk away from building long-range missiles that have no purpose to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=560.6s)]
*  exist other than having nuclear weapons, and they have to walk away from enrichment. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=564.88s)]
*  These are not unreasonable requests. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=569.12s)]
*  There are countries all over the world that have nuclear energy and don't enrich and [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=570.48s)]
*  don't have long-range missiles and don't sponsor terrorism. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=573.88s)]
*  That path is there for them. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=576.9s)]
*  It's the path of peace. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=577.9s)]
*  And frankly, I pray and hope, and we'll do everything we can to hope convince them that [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=578.9s)]
*  they should take it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  I have the same prayer that you do, and they know what the consequences will be, and they [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=583.5600000000001s)]
*  will probably lose their nuclear sites, they'll lose their refineries, and if that's the case, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=589.36s)]
*  that would probably result in poverty and regime change. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=594.32s)]
*  Last question, China. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=597.48s)]
*  You're right. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=599.5200000000001s)]
*  I view them, as you do, as our top geopolitical foe. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=600.5200000000001s)]
*  Things seem to be heated in public. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=604.1s)]
*  Are there anythings going on behind the scenes that give you some hope that hopefully, for [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=605.6s)]
*  example, on trade and tariffs, we can come to some type of agreement? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  Because they put tariffs on basically every American product. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=613.24s)]
*  And it's just, they've been ripping us off forever. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=618.8s)]
*  They have. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=621.64s)]
*  They've been ripping off the world. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=622.64s)]
*  And look, yes, there's efforts. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=623.64s)]
*  You can see that, look, this is hurting the Chinese economy. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=624.64s)]
*  People forget that the factories, where all these shoes and shirts and clothing and all [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=627.28s)]
*  that stuff that comes from China, those are all Chinese jobs. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=631.1199999999999s)]
*  When they say that the containers, that the factories are not going to be sending things [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=634.0999999999999s)]
*  to America, that means they're out of a job. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=637.0999999999999s)]
*  This is hurting the Chinese economy badly. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=639.16s)]
*  I think there's two questions. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=641.16s)]
*  Can we reach some sort of short-term accommodation with them? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=646.52s)]
*  The factories are reaching out. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=648.48s)]
*  They want to meet. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=649.48s)]
*  They want to talk. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=650.48s)]
*  We've got people involved in that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=651.48s)]
*  Obviously, our Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, is involved in those efforts, and their talks [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=652.48s)]
*  will come up soon. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  But I think there's a broader question, and that is whether we shouldn'tâ€”this is a wake-up [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=656.64s)]
*  call that we truly need to become a country that can make more things in America and not [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=660.28s)]
*  be as dependent on China. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=664.68s)]
*  We were far too dependent on China. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=666.36s)]
*  We allowed them, through unfair trade practices, to deindustrialize us and to use not just tariffs, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=668.36s)]
*  but non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, you know, dumping. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=675.08s)]
*  We've allowed them to use all of those things toâ€” [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  Intellectual property theft. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=682.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=683.72s)]
*  Yeah, stealing intellectual property, and really left us deindustrialized as a country [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=684.72s)]
*  and heavily dependent on them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=688.6s)]
*  That's a very dangerous place to be, and President Trump is taking it on, and he's doing it now [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=690.36s)]
*  because it needs to be done now. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=694.38s)]
*  It cannot wait any longer. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=695.96s)]
*  Two more years in this direction, and we are going to be in a lot of trouble, really dependent [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=697.46s)]
*  on China. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=701.24s)]
*  So I do think there's this broader question about how much we should buy from them at [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=702.24s)]
*  all moving forward. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=705.12s)]
*  Well, Godspeed, Mr. Secretary. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=706.6s)]
*  There's a consequential and transformational times, and you're right in the middle of all [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=708.6s)]
*  of it, and, you know, we wish you the best for the sake of the world, and I hope some [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=711.84s)]
*  of these people understand the seriousness of the president. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=716.12s)]
*  Sometimes they might underestimate him. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=719.84s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq91RiLBFC8&t=722.48s)]
