# 'TWISTED PRIORITIES': Are Democrats putting Americans first?
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0)
*  But we begin tonight with a question. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=0.0s)]
*  What have elected Democrats, what have they done for you at all, if not lately? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=3.0s)]
*  Anything? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=7.84s)]
*  Have they improved your schools? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=8.84s)]
*  Did they lower your taxes? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=9.84s)]
*  Did they bring down costs? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=11.76s)]
*  Did they secure your border? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=13.24s)]
*  Did they make your country more safe and more secure? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=14.64s)]
*  Did they put your Social Security, hard-earned money, in the lockbox like they promised? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=17.92s)]
*  Or did they squander your hard-earned tax dollars? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=22.44s)]
*  Are they robbing your children of their future with nearly $40 trillion in debt? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=25.24s)]
*  Oh, how's that Obamacare thing working out for you and your family? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=30.08s)]
*  Did they lift a finger to make any of your lives better? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=33.92s)]
*  We all know the answer. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=38.64s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  But just look at the effort, the resources they are putting into people that are not [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Just today, delegation, Democrats, traveled to Louisiana. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=47.36s)]
*  In this case, they are begging and pleading for the release of two international students [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=50.96s)]
*  that are fighting deportation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=56.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  When those constitutional protections are eroded, the protections of all of us are eroded. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=59.08s)]
*  There's no evidence of finding. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=66.36s)]
*  There's no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=68.68s)]
*  They've been convicted of no crime. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=70.48s)]
*  They were just living their lives and making positive contributions in society every single [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  day. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=79.28s)]
*  This is not about enforcing the law. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=80.68s)]
*  This is moving us toward an authoritarian state. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=84.8s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for suffering a miscarriage. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=87.8s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for reading a banned book. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for practicing diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=95.08s)]
*  It could be you tomorrow for exercising free speech. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=99.4s)]
*  Unless Congress and unless the American people stand up and push back, they will succeed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=103.92s)]
*  They will succeed in destroying our democracy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=109.4s)]
*  They will succeed in destroying what people all around the world admire about the United [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=111.78s)]
*  States of America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=115.58s)]
*  I reject this draconian vision for this country that Donald Trump has. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=116.58s)]
*  He is a dictator. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=121.86s)]
*  And the only way to beat a dictator is with defiance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  This is your modern radical extreme Democratic Party. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=128.06s)]
*  They are literally fighting for the rights of people that are designated gang members. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=131.18s)]
*  In this case, both international students ordered back to their home countries after [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=137.82000000000002s)]
*  the State Department accused them of fomenting anti-American and anti-Semitic rage. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=142.3s)]
*  In particular, Mahmoud Khalil played a prominent role in the disruptive riots at Columbia University [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=147.36s)]
*  that began right after the October 7th attack. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Now Democrats, this is their next cause, Celeb. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=157.72000000000003s)]
*  They want him released back into our country to continue his activism. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  One has to wonder if they even know that Hamas is a designated terrorist organization. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=166.76s)]
*  Their own charter calls for the destruction of Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=171.76s)]
*  The same Democrats have never traveled to the Middle East to demand the release of American [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=175.44s)]
*  citizens still being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=180.61999999999998s)]
*  And these pro-Hamas students, of course, they are now the cause, Celeb. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  We saw the same thing with the suspected gang member, wife-beater, illegal immigrant, Kilmar [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=188.76s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, Chris Van Hollen. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=195.48s)]
*  Four other Democrats that are traveling all the way to El Salvador for this person. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=197.33999999999997s)]
*  This is what is at the top of their list. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  But none of them, and we've looked deeply, we cannot find one of them that bothered to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  pick up a phone and call the family of Marilyn, mother of five, Rachel Morin or Kayla Hamilton. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=209.38s)]
*  Both Marylanders who were raped and murdered by illegal immigrants from El Salvador. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=216.44s)]
*  Van Hollen, after a lot of criticism about this, was shamed into releasing a minor short [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=222.3s)]
*  statement about another Marilyn mother who was murdered by an illegal immigrant, but [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=227.1s)]
*  then spent the rest of the day, you know, on X, you know, tweeting out about his new [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=232.74s)]
*  BFF, the suspected gang member, human trafficker, wife-beater and illegal immigrant. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=237.58s)]
*  Apparently the American people just aren't a top priority for Democrats. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=243.18s)]
*  And here's yet another example. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=248.34s)]
*  Democrats in California have granted early release to an illegal immigrant. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=251.10000000000002s)]
*  A guy driving 100 miles an hour, drunk, high, wasted, slammed into a car, killed two 19-year-olds, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=254.22s)]
*  burning them alive. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=262.5s)]
*  Now, thankfully, the Trump administration has just filed felony charges against this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  illegal immigrant to prevent his release back into the U.S. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, in New Mexico, the state Supreme Court just barred a judge from the bench after [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  an alleged Trende Aragua gang member was arrested at his home. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=277.42s)]
*  By the way, can you believe all this is happening in your country? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=280.82s)]
*  What did I say? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=284.1s)]
*  Biden, Kamala Harris, Mayor Kis, they all have blood on their hands. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=285.1s)]
*  They allowed this to happen and then lied to all of you for four years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=293.1s)]
*  The judge was pictured with his arms around the suspected gang member who entered our [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=294.48s)]
*  country illegally under Biden and Harris in 2023 and then in New York City. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=299.22s)]
*  Thanks to Biden's wide open borders. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, there are so many violent illegal immigrants inside our country that a rival gang to Trende [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=307.26000000000005s)]
*  Aragua has already formed and is now committing a series of chilling crimes in that city. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=312.86s)]
*  So far, 27 have been indicted on sex trafficking, drug trafficking and firearms charges. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  But they're not the only violent offenders who have been roaming the streets. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=324.94s)]
*  Now, this has been going on for years. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=328.18s)]
*  And thanks to the Democrats' open borders policy or their silence and their outright [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=330.62s)]
*  lying about what's been going on the last four years. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=335.46000000000004s)]
*  Look at the headline. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=338.5s)]
*  New York Post, quote, Trump's mass deportation raids result in a six hundred and fifty five [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=339.5s)]
*  percent spike in arrests of terrorists roaming the U.S., including one of India's most wanted. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=345.66s)]
*  Now, if we can somehow avoid a large scale terror attack inside the United States in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=353.86s)]
*  the next few years, it will be thanks to Donald Trump's tough action on immigration. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  If it does happen, that's more blood on Kamala's hands, Biden's hands and Mayorkas's hands. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  And frankly, the Democrats that also lied to us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=369.38s)]
*  If Democrats were still in power, almost none of these terrorist gang members would be deported [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=372.42s)]
*  and more would likely be pouring in every single day, day in and day out. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=378.3s)]
*  This is your new radicalized Democratic Party putting America and your life last every single day. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=383.74s)]
*  To subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFOqLeoywS0&t=393.54s)]
