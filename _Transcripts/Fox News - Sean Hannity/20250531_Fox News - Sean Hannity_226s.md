# ‘This is an ABOMINATION’: Rand Paul
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54)
*  I'm here now with more reaction. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=0.0s)]
*  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=1.6s)]
*  Senator, I am very interested in your thoughts on this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=3.04s)]
*  You are a strict constitutionalist. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=7.2s)]
*  If you assert the Article II powers of a president, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=10.68s)]
*  to me, that is a massive scandal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=15.4s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=19.36s)]
*  Well, you know, this was not a well-kept secret in Washington. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=21.88s)]
*  Scuttlebutt was there calling Jill Biden Mrs. Wilson. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=25.6s)]
*  They called her Mrs. Wilson because Woodrow Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke, you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=29.2s)]
*  know, in 1917, 1918, and basically she ran the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=33.76s)]
*  So it's not even the first time this kind of thing has happened. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=39.0s)]
*  It is an abomination. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=42.16s)]
*  It is awful what has happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=43.16s)]
*  I do think we will get to the truth of this, though, because there actually has to be a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=45.28s)]
*  person who ran the auto pen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=49.32s)]
*  Someone had to do it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=51.64s)]
*  And I think if we find that person, the next question is, who asked you to do that? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=52.8s)]
*  If that chain doesn't lead up to the president, I think that you will have a catastrophe, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=58.04s)]
*  and they will have a catastrophe that they can't even contain. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=63.4s)]
*  Now, there's a possibility, as you ask them, they finally say, well, so-and-so told me [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=65.76s)]
*  to do it, so-and-so told me to do it, and then the president will, in writing, say, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=70.16s)]
*  I told them to do it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=74.6s)]
*  I think it will be very difficult to have the president actually come and testify. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=75.64s)]
*  I think, generally, it will be very difficult to have doctors testify because of patient [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=79.4s)]
*  privacy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=84.2s)]
*  I think it will be very difficult to have family members. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=85.2s)]
*  Unless they were running the auto pen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=87.4s)]
*  If Jill Biden was running the auto pen, you can make her testify. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=89.48s)]
*  Anything beyond that, I think it will be difficult to ever come in. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=94.12s)]
*  But even if Joe Biden himself came in, he probably would just lie, in my view. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  He wouldn't want this to be staying on his so-called legacy. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=102.92s)]
*  And we now have heard some of the her interview and the her report. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, everything that he wrote in that report, now we know why they didn't want to release [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  the audio of the transcript of what happened here, because Joe was that bad. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=117.52s)]
*  I would imagine if he went before a Senate committee or a House committee, he's not going [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=123.12s)]
*  to be up to the task. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=127.08s)]
*  Would you agree? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=128.52s)]
*  Yeah, the interview with her was extraordinary. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=129.52s)]
*  To have had a president, a leader of the free world, who was actually judged to be incompetent [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=133.02s)]
*  to testify, that he could not be a reliable witness, that he could not be a competent [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=138.4s)]
*  witness, and he couldn't stand trial for lack of competency, at the same time was the leader [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=143.04s)]
*  of the free world and the president of the United States. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=147.76s)]
*  It's just extraordinary. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=150.2s)]
*  And I think that audio coming out is so damaging to all those who supported President Biden, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  went on and on and pampered him and kept him in power. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=160.0s)]
*  People in the media, as well as his staff, are guilty of, if not a crime, a great disservice [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  to the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, you mentioned Woodrow Wilson and his wife and the stroke that was debilitating [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=169.88s)]
*  in his life. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=174.88s)]
*  There's one big difference, though, and that is we live in a nuclear age, and he has a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=175.88s)]
*  nuclear football, and it's with the president at all times. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  And he was not capable, I think, of making that decision. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=184.88s)]
*  And the fact that everybody knew it, hid it, lied about it, covered it up, we've got to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=188.6s)]
*  know who was really in charge here, because they would have been in charge of that decision. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=194.4s)]
*  That's the chilling part. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=201.32s)]
*  It's a lot different than 1918. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=202.32s)]
*  Senator, we appreciate it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=204.68s)]
*  Yeah, without question, a much more complicated one. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=206.72s)]
*  You get the last word. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=209.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=210.04s)]
*  Way more complicated, absolutely. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=211.04s)]
*  Question. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=212.04s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul, thank you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=213.04s)]
*  Where else? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGvYVfXvg54&t=224.32s)]
