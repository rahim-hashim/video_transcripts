# NPR CEO was a 'human Chernobyl' at hearing, critic says
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc)
*  All right, earlier today, the CEOs of NPR, PBS, appeared before lawmakers on the newly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=0.0s)]
*  formed Doge subcommittee, hoping to shore up more of your hard-earned tax dollars. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=5.92s)]
*  Needless to say, there was plenty of fireworks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=11.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=14.08s)]
*  First of all, I do want to say that NPR acknowledges that we were mistaken in failing to cover the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=15.08s)]
*  Hunter Biden laptop story more aggressively and sooner. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=19.76s)]
*  Do you believe that America is addicted to white supremacy? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=22.92s)]
*  I believe that I tweeted that, and as I've said earlier, I believe much of my thinking [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=27.16s)]
*  has evolved over the last half decade. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Do you believe that America believes in black plunder and white democracy? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=33.92s)]
*  I don't believe that, sir. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=38.08s)]
*  You tweeted that in reference to a book you were reading at the time, apparently, The [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=41.08s)]
*  Case for Reparations. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=45.22s)]
*  I don't think I've ever read that book, sir. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=47.08s)]
*  You tweeted about it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  You said you took a day off to fully read The Case for Reparations. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  You put that on Twitter in January of 2020. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=55.48s)]
*  Do you believe that white people inherently feel superior to other races? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  I do not. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=61.76s)]
*  You don't? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=62.76s)]
*  You tweeted something to that effect. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=63.76s)]
*  You said, I grew up feeling superior. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=65.32s)]
*  Ha, how white of me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=67.52s)]
*  Why did you tweet that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=69.16s)]
*  A few years ago, NPR educated America about, quote, the whole community of genderqueer [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=70.16s)]
*  dinosaur enthusiasts. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=75.56s)]
*  Do you think that that's an inappropriate use of tax dollars? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=77.24s)]
*  Your health advisor at NPR also stated in an interview that, quote, fear of fatness [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=81.36s)]
*  is more harmful than actual fat. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=85.56s)]
*  Would you like to explain how fear of fatness is more harmful than actual fat? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=87.88s)]
*  That's directly, that's an editorial at NPR. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=92.44s)]
*  I am not familiar with the editorial, and I don't believe that was published during [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=94.92s)]
*  my time here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  It's called Diet Culture is Everywhere. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Here's How to Fight It. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that that's an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  I think any reporting on health is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars, yes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=104.24s)]
*  Has Ms. Piggy ever been caught trying to funnel billions of dollars in government contracts [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=108.64s)]
*  to herself and to her companies? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=114.04s)]
*  How about Arthur the Aardvark? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=115.88s)]
*  Has he ever fired independent government watchdogs who are investigating his companies? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=117.44s)]
*  You believe your reporters are fair? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=121.8s)]
*  You said you're fair and they're working at it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=124.0s)]
*  I believe that they work to be every day, sir. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=125.6s)]
*  They're non-biased. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=127.36s)]
*  And yet, you have the voter registration issue. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=128.36s)]
*  I mean, we're all human beings. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=131.8s)]
*  We're all going to see through the world through a certain lens. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=133.44s)]
*  Are you aware of any Republicans, any registered Republicans in your newsroom? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=137.16s)]
*  I couldn't say registered, but I know we have conservatives in our newsroom, yes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=141.52s)]
*  OK, so the recent registration, when it was looked at, 87 Democrats and zero Republicans [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=145.04s)]
*  registered. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=152.28s)]
*  I found that very concerning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=153.28s)]
*  Yeah, I would. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=154.28s)]
*  Not even 40 to 30 or 50 to 20. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=155.28s)]
*  87 to zero. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=157.12s)]
*  I don't even know how to react to that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=159.4s)]
*  So we have to bring in Fox News contributor, senior writer, by the way, for The Washington [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=161.44s)]
*  Examiner, Joe Concha. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  I'll let you respond to that because I have, you know, one word, two words, depending on [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=166.76s)]
*  how you want to say it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=171.92s)]
*  Check and mate. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Checkmate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like asking a question or two, which is how did somebody not pull a fire [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  alarm or call 911? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  Because I've never seen such a blowout on Capitol Hill like that before. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=183.28s)]
*  I mean, it was just generally hilarious, Sean, to hear Catherine Mayer say her past statements [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=188.32s)]
*  and social media posts, some of which that were just read there during that model or [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=193.92s)]
*  that montage, had no bearing whatsoever on NPR's editorial decisions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, go listen to NPR for three minutes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=201.48s)]
*  Trust me, you'll have a decidedly different opinion. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=203.72s)]
*  And if any of the folks from Doge are watching this and we're watching today, Elon, if you're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=206.24s)]
*  looking for some waste that could be really easy to cut, look no further than, you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=211.04s)]
*  MSNPR or MSPBS. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=215.88s)]
*  And as you just saw, Sean, its CEO, Catherine Maher, it was a human Chernobyl on Capitol [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=218.56s)]
*  Hill today. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=224.16s)]
*  I mean, the fact that it was during the years, it really was. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=225.16s)]
*  You almost felt sorry for her, almost. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=229.76s)]
*  But during the Biden years, NPR, here's one example. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=232.08s)]
*  They stopped its tradition, 50 year tradition of reading the Declaration of Independence [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=234.72s)]
*  on Independence Day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=239.68s)]
*  That's nice, right? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=241.32s)]
*  Instead, they decided that having a discussion on how Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=242.32s)]
*  of Independence were actually racist. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=247.16s)]
*  Yeah, they thought that was a better idea. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=248.76s)]
*  I mean, Maher alone, she called President Trump a racist, a sociopath during the 2020 [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=250.96s)]
*  election, all while sporting a Biden for president hat. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=255.92s)]
*  It's on social media. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=258.88s)]
*  You could go see it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=260.2s)]
*  So at this point, if she keeps this up, if the CEO of PBS keeps this up, they'll both [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=261.4s)]
*  be co-hosting The View by next week. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=266.1s)]
*  And the big question here in the end, why should even one American taxpayer dollar be [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=268.68s)]
*  given to PBS or NPR? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=273.92s)]
*  Because according to Pew Research, the audiences at NPR and PBS are among the most liberal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=276.04s)]
*  in America. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Nearly three quarters, for example, of NPR's and PBS's audience describe themselves as [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  consistently liberal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  Almost no conservatives watch. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  So what's the old slogan here? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=290.48s)]
*  Fair and balanced? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=292.04s)]
*  Doesn't exist there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=293.04s)]
*  So I say, make PBS and NPR be solvent on their own, just like every other news outlet. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=294.04s)]
*  They've been around, at least NPR has, for 55 years. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  The government does not need to hold their hand and give them money anymore. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=302.96s)]
*  So the whole community of genderqueer dinosaur enthusiasts, fear of fatness is more harmful [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=307.76s)]
*  than actual fat. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  I think my favorite answer, though, was she said that she thinks her thinking has evolved [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=315.88s)]
*  over the last half decade. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=321.44s)]
*  That means in the last five years. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  That means the person that believed America's addicted to white supremacy, the person that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  believed that America believes in black plunder and white democracy, the case for reparations, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=332.88s)]
*  which she put out there, and that white people are—white people inherently feel superior [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  to other races. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=345.8s)]
*  So we're supposed to believe that her thinking has evolved in the last five years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=347.36s)]
*  And we're supposed to believe that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=353.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  Sounds to me like an election year conversion, like this is a, I want to stay on my job and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  have the taxpayers fund my great way of life, and I'll say anything to save my job. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=361.48s)]
*  You get the last word. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGOr6e0yFjc&t=366.92s)]
