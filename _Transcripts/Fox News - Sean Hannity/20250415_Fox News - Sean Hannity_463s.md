# DETAILS REVEALED: Trump special envoy shares more on 4-hour Putin meeting
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg)
*  All right, the Trump administration, they've been working hard now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=0.0s)]
*  They've been working for months trying to clean up the total mess Joe Biden left behind [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=5.08s)]
*  all around the world. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=9.52s)]
*  And one man at the center of all these efforts has been the special envoy, Steve Woodcoff. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=10.92s)]
*  In recent days, he met with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Iranian foreign minister [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=16.14s)]
*  as President Trump is now working to bring the Russian invasion of Ukraine to an end [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=21.82s)]
*  and bring peace to Europe and prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=26.8s)]
*  Not exactly the easiest meeting schedule in the entire world. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  So what is it like to be involved in high stakes negotiations? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=35.96s)]
*  Well, we asked the man himself, White House special envoy Steve Woodcoff. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=39.68s)]
*  A lot of people are skeptical, Steve, good to see you, by the way, on both fronts here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=45.28s)]
*  Is there with Putin a deal emerging? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=50.4s)]
*  Or is he trying to buy time knowing that Putin sees a window of opportunity without hundreds [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=55.16s)]
*  of billions of U.S. dollars in weaponry, you know, giving him a military advantage? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Do you really see a deal emerging? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=67.08s)]
*  Are you confident? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=68.96s)]
*  I think you used a very good word there, Sean, emerging. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=72.32s)]
*  I do. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=75.56s)]
*  This is the third meeting I've had with him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=78.04s)]
*  This last meeting lasted close to five hours. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=79.88s)]
*  We had two of his key advisers in the room at the time, Ushakov and Kirill Demetriev. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=83.72s)]
*  And it was a compelling meeting. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=92.98s)]
*  And towards the end, we actually came up with—and I'm going to say finally, but I don't [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=94.84s)]
*  mean it in the way that we were waiting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean it in the way that it took a while for us to get to this place, what Putin's [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  request is to have a permanent peace here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  So beyond the ceasefire, we got an answer to that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=120.28s)]
*  And will the deal include things that maybe are out of the box, that people aren't thinking [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=121.8s)]
*  about now? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=126.16s)]
*  I would imagine Vladimir Putin probably would want to be in business with the U.S. and with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=127.16s)]
*  Europe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=132.76s)]
*  Is that a potential that could come out of this? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=134.02s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=137.86s)]
*  I mean, this peace deal is about these so-called five territories, but there's so much more [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  to it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  There's security protocols. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=148.9s)]
*  There's, you know, no NATO, NATO, Article 5. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=151.82000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's just, you know, a lot of detail attached to it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=157.5s)]
*  It's a complicated situation from, you know, rooted in, you know, some real problematic [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=162.34s)]
*  things happening between the two countries. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=171.82s)]
*  And I think we might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=173.58s)]
*  world at large. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  On top of that, I believe there's a possibility to reshape the Russian-United States relationship [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=182.22s)]
*  through some very compelling commercial opportunities that I think give real stability to the region, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=192.02s)]
*  too. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=200.02s)]
*  Partnerships create stability. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=201.02s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=203.02s)]
*  Money solves a lot of problems, Steve. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  You've been a successful businessman your whole career. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=206.1s)]
*  Let me go to Iran, if I may, and meeting face to face with the Iranian foreign minister, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=208.3s)]
*  the first known contact with the U.S. and Iran since the president took office. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=214.74s)]
*  One question, but a different context. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=219.9s)]
*  Are the Iranians trying to buy time? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=221.9s)]
*  My understanding and public disclosures have them at, and the IAEA report, about 60 percent [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=224.5s)]
*  enrichment. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=231.22s)]
*  To get from 60 to 90 percent, which is weapon-grade enrichment, is a very short period of time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=233.82s)]
*  Then they would need a delivery system. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=240.42s)]
*  So my question is this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  Both you and the president have been very adamant that the Iranian and Iranians cannot [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=243.94s)]
*  get a bomb. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=249.02s)]
*  I agree with both of you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=250.02s)]
*  I'm skeptical, like a lot of other people, how do you have a conversation with people [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=251.7s)]
*  that believe in a caliphate, convert or die, and the notion that they've got to wipe Israel [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=257.46s)]
*  and the U.S. off the map? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=265.86s)]
*  I don't know if it's ever going to be possible to get a deal with people that have that ideology [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=267.42s)]
*  and mindset. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=273.18s)]
*  How'd it go? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=274.18s)]
*  Well, Sean, the president's message of peace through strength, it resonates throughout [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=276.78s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=281.82s)]
*  This is not a threat on my part now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=284.46s)]
*  It is just a simple fact. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=286.34s)]
*  The president means what he says, which is they cannot have a bomb. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  The conversation with the Iranians will be much about two critical points. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=294.05999999999995s)]
*  One, enrichment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  As you mentioned, they do not need to enrich past 3.67 percent. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=301.05999999999995s)]
*  In some circumstances, they're at 60 percent, in other circumstances, 20 percent. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=306.52s)]
*  That cannot be. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=311.64s)]
*  And you do not need to run, as they claim, a civil nuclear program where you're enriching [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=312.82s)]
*  past 3.67 percent. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=318.96s)]
*  So this is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program and then ultimately [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=321.56s)]
*  verification on weaponization. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=328.94s)]
*  That includes missiles, the type of missiles that they have stockpiled there, and it includes [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=331.92s)]
*  the trigger for a bomb. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=339.36s)]
*  And I think we're here to have, as the president indicated, and I take my direction from him [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=341.36s)]
*  every day that I go to work, we're here to see if we can solve this situation diplomatically [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=346.72s)]
*  and with dialogue. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=354.56s)]
*  The first meeting was positive, constructive, compelling. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=355.7s)]
*  I'm a trust but verify guy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=360.96s)]
*  Would it include, Steve, anywhere, any place, anytime, U.S. inspectors, not U.N. inspectors? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=362.8s)]
*  That would have to be critical. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=370.76s)]
*  I don't trust the U.N. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=371.76s)]
*  I don't think you do either. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=372.76s)]
*  Now, look, the devil, as you know, we've talked about this, the devil will be in the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=374.36s)]
*  details of the document and hopefully we'll have that high-quality problem of getting [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=380.0s)]
*  a document drafted. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=385.42s)]
*  That verification will be the key point that undergirds this agreement if we're fortunate [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=387.6s)]
*  enough to get there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=395.08s)]
*  And we're going to have to have very tight verification. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=396.08s)]
*  There hasn't been much in the way of verification in the last several years prior to our administration. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=399.48s)]
*  That's got to change. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=406.72s)]
*  And if it changes, then we'll have the basis for positive talks. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=409.32s)]
*  And if it doesn't change, then we'll have to seek alternatives, which will not be good [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=413.82s)]
*  for anybody. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=418.54s)]
*  Well, they will be the masters of their own destiny and we know what that means. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=419.54s)]
*  They won't have refineries and they won't have nuclear sites to even talk about if that's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=425.94s)]
*  the path they choose. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=430.62s)]
*  I have a very hard time trusting people that believe in a caliphate, convert or die, death [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=431.62s)]
*  to Israel, death to America. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=436.94s)]
*  With all that said, I do wish you luck. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=439.74s)]
*  It would be great for the world, for the Middle East, for peace in general, if it could be [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=442.82s)]
*  resolved with verification. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=447.34s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf, thank you. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFj2sH7vcg&t=449.78s)]
