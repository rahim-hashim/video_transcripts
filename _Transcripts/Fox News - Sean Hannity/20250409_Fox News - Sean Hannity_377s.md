# Sen. Kennedy gets laughs from senators, Hannity with response to AOC
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU)
*  And welcome back. We're broadcasting live. We are in our nation's capital and we still have all these great senators with us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=0.0s)]
*  I really do appreciate all y'all spending some time. This is an important time for the American people [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=6.58s)]
*  This is that four times in a hundred years and then we're gonna have to get the house to go along with it [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=11.74s)]
*  And if you pass it in the Senate, they pass it now all the they're not agreeing to anything [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=16.88s)]
*  They're just opening the door you wanted to make that distinction [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  People get confused about the budget right most most misunderstandings between my wife and I is a misunderstanding, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=24.68s)]
*  It's not an argument. Just that we don't understand [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  You're wrong. Oh, no, no [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=33.56s)]
*  But with the house right now, I think there's a misunderstanding what the budget actually does the budget does nothing to instruct them [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=38.8s)]
*  It's just the vehicle for us to move to reconciliation if we don't get the budget passed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=44.32s)]
*  We can't get to really reconciliation and reconciliation is where all the cuts come in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=48.32s)]
*  That's where we take Doge into consideration. That's when we start trying to balance the budget [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=52.16s)]
*  That's when where we can start making the tax cuts permanent [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=55.8s)]
*  The house members are hearing you clearly because that's important [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=58.72s)]
*  This is our moment it is a moment in time and we have got to seize it [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=62.36s)]
*  The American people have said to us like we want results and if we don't move forward with this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=66.36s)]
*  We don't even have an opportunity for reconciliation. We can't deliver what President Trump can't paid on and what we all campaigned on [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=71.56s)]
*  Let me let me move on a little bit so we have this high-level meeting of some kind taking place with Iran [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  It's going to take place on Saturday [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  The president was very clear with Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=88.6s)]
*  That Iran will never have nuclear weapons and if they try to the price that they will pay will be severe [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=91.84s)]
*  I interpret that very clearly and I read today that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  B-52s that have let's see [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Capabilities of being stealth number one and bunker buster bombs number two [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=105.72s)]
*  Happen to be in the region. I don't think it's a coincidence just a guess [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu the second visit since Donald Trump's gotten back in office. The question is between Iran and China and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=116.0s)]
*  The Russia Ukraine conflict in Gaza. We got a lot of foreign policy issues [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  What about the Iran question because there are some people that I don't think you can negotiate with [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=130.08s)]
*  Madman and I think the Iranian mullahs believe in you know, the caliphate which is convert or die [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=136.44s)]
*  And I don't know how you negotiate with crazy people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=142.96s)]
*  Absolutely. Look and President Trump understands peace through strength [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=145.84s)]
*  I mean, that's what we are seeing right now and Iran knows that and to your point [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  We can never allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We know that they will actually use it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=152.46s)]
*  It is not going to be for a deterrent. It will be for use [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=157.12s)]
*  We know what the breakout time is because the IAEA said very soon [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=159.84s)]
*  Yeah [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=163.96s)]
*  Absolutely [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=166.56s)]
*  If not ours, that's what Joe Biden did [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=168.56s)]
*  Joe Joe Biden flowed a hundred billion dollars to Iran and allowed them to get a breakout time that is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  Unbelievably quick and there are 60% enrichment is what I've read that's in the public domain [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=179.36s)]
*  If they can get to 90% in no time, that's weapons grade [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=184.28s)]
*  Lindsay if they have if they have a missile to deliver but they look it if Iran gets a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=188.12s)]
*  Nuclear weapon there's going to be a war and Iran won't start it and I'm not saying America will [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=196.28s)]
*  Israel will although they're gonna John they're there missile they can put it in a boat and stay [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=203.4s)]
*  Israel will slap Iran to Pluto [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=208.84s)]
*  Don't and I don't need our help and support wouldn't they need our bunker busters wouldn't they need our plans to deliver them? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=213.28s)]
*  Tom probably knows more about this to most of us. He's the Intel chairman [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=221.44s)]
*  But I think May 8th or 9th is the 80th anniversary of the end of World War two [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  If you told somebody back then in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=231.8s)]
*  2025 there'd be a nation-state [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=235.12s)]
*  Calling for the extinction of the Jews they want a nuclear weapon and people wonder what should we do? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=237.56s)]
*  So 80 years later, here's where we find ourselves. They have enough [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=244.0s)]
*  Hylian race uranium to make six bombs and [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=247.96s)]
*  Katie said something all of us agree with they will use it if you're watching TV out there [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=251.4s)]
*  Iran is very close to assembling six nuclear bombs. They will kill Israel. They'll come after us [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=256.76s)]
*  They'll try to purify Islam [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=263.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is the only thing between them and a bomb [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  They have to believe he will take down their refineries [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  They have to believe that he will blow them off the face of the planet or they're gonna get a bomb [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=272.32000000000005s)]
*  senator cotton [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how the president could be any more clear. He said repeatedly since he took office [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=280.16s)]
*  You're on the Intel committee, you know a lot more than I do [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, he said repeatedly that Iran's not gonna have a nuclear weapon he's been saying it for ten years [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  We've all been saying it for as long as we've been in public office [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=291.0s)]
*  He wants to give him the path to a diplomatic deal like Libya had in the public domain [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  The read is they are close. They are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=299.04s)]
*  Munch they're very they're very close not just to getting to the enriched uranium [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  They need but a delivery system and not just for Israel but for the United States [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  They're probably sure but I don't trust these people if they get it [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  I think they'll use it and we'll have a modern-day Holocaust [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=314.76s)]
*  What's that senator there are only two or three years probably from a missile that could hit the United States as well [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=320.76s)]
*  So it's not just a threat to our friends in Israel to the United States itself. I got 30 seconds [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=325.2s)]
*  I got to give it to Senator Kennedy. What do you think of the new leadership Jasmine AOC and Bernie? I [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=329.56s)]
*  Consider congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to be the leader of the Democratic Party [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=335.48s)]
*  She's entitled to her opinion. I'm entitled to mine [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=340.92s)]
*  As I've said about her before I think she's the reason there are directions on the shampoo bottle [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=344.76s)]
*  Our plan for dealing [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=353.4s)]
*  We got a heart our plan for dealing with her is opera called operation. Let her speak [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll come back more Hannity. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm19wvEiVnU&t=361.92s)]
