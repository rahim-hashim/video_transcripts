# ‘RAPID PACE’: New details on Biden’s mental acuity investigation
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks)
*  Here with more someone leading his own investigation into this major scandal house oversight committee chairman James Comer is with us James Comer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's start with you and say okay [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=7.58s)]
*  So you have been in touch with four people on his staff and his doctor [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=9.98s)]
*  What is the status of that and are you planning on calling a lot more people? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=15.66s)]
*  Yes, but to answer your first question we've had communication for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=20.96s)]
*  Over a week now with their attorneys. We notified the four staffers and dr. O'connor [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=26.28s)]
*  Ten days ago. We've made rapid progress in ten days [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=32.56s)]
*  You have to give them an opportunity to come in voluntarily [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  You have to give them an opportunity to hire an attorney or in other words due process [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=38.32s)]
*  They've hired attorneys our staff attorneys have been communicating with their attorneys [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=43.36s)]
*  I'm very pleased to announce tonight that I expect the date [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  To be announced very soon where every staffer will be coming forward and answering questions [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=51.22s)]
*  Voluntarily by our committee if for some reason they backtrack in the next 24 hours [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=57.98s)]
*  Then they will receive a subpoena and they know that with dr. O'connor. We have a call tomorrow with his attorneys [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=61.98s)]
*  I expect the same from dr. O'connor [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=67.34s)]
*  So this investigation is moving at a rapid pace Sean and you know that there's been a ton of information [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=69.42s)]
*  That's come out in the last seven days [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=75.42s)]
*  From from eyewitness accounts the tell-all books the Tapper book [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=78.42s)]
*  People like Buddha Jag interviews that have surfaced where Joe Biden didn't know about executive orders. He just signed so this investigation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=83.42s)]
*  I think is going to move at a pace that we're very pleased to see for a congressional investigation [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=90.68s)]
*  You said on this program that these people are lawyered up at this particular time. Have you had conversations with their lawyers? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=96.34s)]
*  Will these people be under oath for these transcriptions? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=103.22s)]
*  Yes, if they come in voluntarily [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=106.9s)]
*  They will they will you know have to sit down for interviews the way a congressional transcribed interview goes the majority party [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=109.34s)]
*  Which of course is the Republicans will have an hour to ask questions [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=116.34s)]
*  Every member on the House Oversight Committee who wants to participate in that will participate in that along with our attorneys in the Democrats [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=118.9s)]
*  Get an hour we'll rotate back and forth until we ask all the questions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  These are very substantive if you lie to Congress [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=128.86s)]
*  If they come in with a subpoena then that'll be a deposition which is a little more formal [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=132.9s)]
*  But either way if they say something that's not true [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=137.74s)]
*  That's a felony and they will be referred criminally to Pam Bondi at the Department of Justice. They know that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=140.38s)]
*  That's why they they've hired [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=146.5s)]
*  You know looks to me like pretty pretty big-time attorneys to come in and and now I can say denied on your show Sean [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=148.06s)]
*  That we're moving on to the next batch of people that we've identified that would have [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=155.26000000000002s)]
*  Some responsibility of the auto pen the amount of information that's coming in is very rapid and with this investigation [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=161.54000000000002s)]
*  Versus the last by the influence pedal investigation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=168.86s)]
*  We haven't thus far faced a weaponized left-wing media because I think the left-wing media knows [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=171.5s)]
*  That this was a cover-up and I think there's a little bit of curiosity now as to who was actually running the country [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=176.86s)]
*  What about Josh Hawley suggesting on this show? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=183.02s)]
*  That in fact Secret Service agents said that Joe Biden was getting lost in his own closet [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  Is that going to be investigated? Well, those secret service agents be asked [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=191.78s)]
*  Absolutely. We're starting with these staffers that we know are the ones who [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=196.78s)]
*  Manually put the documents in the auto pen and press the power button to sign Joe Biden's signature [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  We want to know who told him to do what and when we want to know [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=206.06s)]
*  That Joe Biden actually gave the authority to do that that Joe Biden was cognitively aware of what he was doing if he even [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  Told them to use the auto pen. That's why we're bringing in dr. O'connor. We all know that dr. O'connor [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=217.74s)]
*  Continuously issued reports saying Joe Biden was a picture of health everyone in America knows that wasn't true [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  We saw that in the debate and as more information comes forward [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=230.82s)]
*  Dr. O'Connor is going to have a hard time explaining these [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=234.3s)]
*  Brilliant reports of health that he was issuing on Joe Biden when he was president [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=238.22s)]
*  How high up in terms of the people in the higher positions of power in the in the Biden White House? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=242.86s)]
*  Do you think you will go and will you bring in the family members? Will you bring in dr. Jill Biden? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=250.02s)]
*  Will you bring in Hunter Biden? Will you bring in Jim Biden? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=254.82000000000002s)]
*  If they're implicated as to having any part in the decision-making process of using the auto pen then yes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=258.26s)]
*  They will be brought in I can tell you with confidence people like Ron claim will be asked to come in before our committee [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  We're moving at a rapid pace [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=272.22s)]
*  We feel confident that the negotiations with the first four staffers as well as dr [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=274.66s)]
*  O'connor have gone well enough to where we can start the process of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=279.82s)]
*  Initiating the next batch of employees and we're gonna follow the trail just like we followed the money trail in the Biden influence [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=283.58000000000004s)]
*  Pedaling investigation we're gonna follow the trail of who said what and when? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=289.42s)]
*  With respect to the auto pen because the amount of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=293.54s)]
*  Executive orders that were signed in the last 90 days of the Biden presidency is breathtaking [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=296.82s)]
*  I don't think the average American realizes how much activity there was in this White House at a time when almost every American now [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=302.42s)]
*  realizes that Joe Biden was completely checked out and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=309.62s)]
*  You're having executive orders that many of which Sean were used to Trump proof this administration [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  Making it harder for Donald Trump to to fulfill his his commitment to fulfill his agenda [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=319.86s)]
*  Because he's getting you know having to fight in court against all these executive orders that were signed by the auto pen [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=326.74s)]
*  So this should be an investigation [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=333.08s)]
*  I think every Americans going to be interested in and and this time I think that everyone in America is going to step back and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=334.98s)]
*  Allow the oversight committee to be able to ask these questions because everybody wants to know the answers [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=341.34s)]
*  They know something bad was going on in the White House [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=345.62s)]
*  They just don't know who was actually caught in the shots [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=347.94s)]
*  I'd like to know who the person was that said apparently quoted by Tapper and the other guy [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=350.78s)]
*  That made the suggestion that well if he won the second term [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=356.42s)]
*  We would just bring him out every so often to prove that he was still alive, you know proof of life [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=360.54s)]
*  That's that's chilling [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=366.42s)]
*  Anyway, Chairman Comer, we appreciate your time. We're gonna follow this story closely [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=368.5s)]
*  Could be the biggest presidential and White House scandal in our lifetime and in history [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaHKpy4d6Ks&t=372.82s)]
