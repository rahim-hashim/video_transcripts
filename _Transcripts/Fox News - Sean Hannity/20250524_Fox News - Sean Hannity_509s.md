# Harvard 'taught' antisemitism, Alan Dershowitz says
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0)
*  Joining us now with reaction Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=0.0s)]
*  Miranda Devine and Project 21 Chairman Horace Cooper. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=5.64s)]
*  Professor, let's start with you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=9.6s)]
*  This has got to get under your skin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=11.86s)]
*  This is very personal. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=14.06s)]
*  You spent a lot of time at Harvard and they have lost their way, my friend. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=15.96s)]
*  Sixty years at Harvard and they're being let off easily. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=21.84s)]
*  It's not that they tolerated anti-Semitism. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  They taught it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=29.28s)]
*  They taught it in the Divinity School. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=30.62s)]
*  They taught it in the public health school. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=32.76s)]
*  That's the conclusion that the Harvard report reached. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=34.6s)]
*  This man who killed these two wonderful young people was stimulated, incited by what is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=38.8s)]
*  being taught at places like Harvard and Columbia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=45.96s)]
*  And there is blood on the hands of professors and students who are calling for a globalized [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=50.28s)]
*  the antifada. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=56.48s)]
*  What does a globalized antifada mean? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=57.48s)]
*  The actual antifada, 4,000 innocent people were killed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=58.48s)]
*  They were blown up in buses and pizza parlors. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=63.4s)]
*  And when people say globalize the antifada, what they're saying is kill Jews. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=66.28s)]
*  And that's coming from Harvard, that's coming from Columbia, and it has to stop. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=71.22s)]
*  And cutting off funds. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=76.7s)]
*  Look, in 1935, Harvard was admitting Nazi students, Nazi faculty. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=77.96s)]
*  They were sending faculty over to German universities. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=83.64s)]
*  Wouldn't every liberal have been thrilled if the visas had been cut off from the Nazi [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=86.88s)]
*  students and if funding had been cut off? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=90.96s)]
*  Well, you can't distinguish between that and what's going on today on college campuses. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  What's going on today on college campuses is what the Klan did in 1955 when they intimidated [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=98.96s)]
*  black students on campus. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=104.84s)]
*  Now that the shoe is on the other foot and the victims of all this violence and discrimination [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=106.64s)]
*  of Jews, liberals can't simply say, oh my God, it's a matter of academic freedom. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=111.48s)]
*  If it wasn't a matter of academic freedom in 1935 and 1955, then surely universities [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  have an obligation not to foment and incentivize the kind of killings that we're going to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  see. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=129.56s)]
*  And it's going to get worse. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=130.56s)]
*  I have to now go, I have to go now and get security guards. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=131.56s)]
*  I have been told by law enforcement officials that I am not safe because I am a highly visible [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=135.08s)]
*  pro-Israel supporter and I have a target on my back as do many other pro-Israel supporters. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=142.16s)]
*  And Miranda, that's part of the problem exactly what the professor is talking about. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=150.84s)]
*  To have people gunned down there in Washington, D.C., people that are working at an embassy, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=155.26s)]
*  young people, innocent people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  These are the allegations. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=163.6s)]
*  We'll see if they're true, but that's the allegation. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=164.6s)]
*  We've seen all this rhetoric and then suddenly people act on it and then everybody acts surprised, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  at least on the left. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=172.96s)]
*  Yes, Jason, look, it's just shocking to hear that, that Professor Dershowitz is being told [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=174.96s)]
*  that he has to hire security guards to protect himself because he is a high-profile Jew in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=182.96s)]
*  America. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  That is simply terrible. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  And this terrorist, this anti-Semitic terrorist who murdered in cold blood Yaron and Sarah, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=194.68s)]
*  two beautiful young people, one Jewish, one Christian, who represented everything that's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=203.68s)]
*  good about those two religions. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=210.68s)]
*  And the police report shows that this murderer went after Sarah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=214.68s)]
*  First of all, he shot them in the back and then when Sarah was crawling still alive trying [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=220.84s)]
*  to get away, he went and shot her several times more to make sure she was dead. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=225.72s)]
*  And he did this in a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=231.32s)]
*  It wasn't an Israeli museum, it wasn't a political place, it was a museum dedicated to celebrating [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=236.34s)]
*  the stories of Jewish people in Washington, people like the late Supreme Court Justice [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=244.46s)]
*  Ginsburg. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=250.9s)]
*  There were oral histories of Holocaust survivors. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=253.58s)]
*  This was an attack on the Jewish people and to try and dress it up in some sort of political [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=257.62s)]
*  fashion, no. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=263.5s)]
*  This is naked anti-Semitism and this killer was marinating in it among his peers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  These far left anti-Semites who are really in bed with the Islamists. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=274.34s)]
*  So Horace, wrap this together for us because what I see is, I see Tim Walz, the former [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=281.5s)]
*  Democratic vice presidential nominee, going out there and comparing ICE officers to the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=288.02s)]
*  Gestapo. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=294.85999999999996s)]
*  The Gestapo of everybody. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=296.34s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=298.06s)]
*  And then they have these riots and these calls for death to Jews, the Intifada. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=299.78s)]
*  It all ties together and then the left just feigns like they, and you can't seem to find [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=307.17999999999995s)]
*  a Chuck Schumer or somebody else out there who is vehemently out there pounding the payment [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  saying this will not stand. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=318.26s)]
*  I just don't see that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=319.9s)]
*  So what in the world is going on, Horace? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=321.58s)]
*  The evil of anti-Semitism is just going to have to be pulled root and branch out of our [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=325.94s)]
*  country, our system. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=334.86s)]
*  We can't allow people to come to this country that are going to foam in it and we're going [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=336.86s)]
*  to have to say to our universities that they can't act to encourage it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=341.18s)]
*  I would encourage local churches to reach out to Jewish communities in their areas so [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=347.86s)]
*  that people can see and understand and better appreciate the great values and the great [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=357.22s)]
*  people that so many of the Jews are. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=365.94s)]
*  Now, I just want to turn real quick though to the New York Times feeling like it's their [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=369.18s)]
*  job to limit the downside of the abuses of these radical evil people. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=375.18s)]
*  Could you imagine during Jim Crow when the auxiliary, excuse me, the military wing of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=384.66s)]
*  the Democrats called the Ku Klux Klan had been caught bombing, had been caught hanging, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=392.38s)]
*  engaging in dangerous life-threatening activities. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=401.46s)]
*  Could you imagine the New York Times saying, well now, what is this going to do to the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=405.78s)]
*  arguments about federalism? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=412.62s)]
*  What is this going to do about the arguments about state rights? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=414.85999999999996s)]
*  What America did then is what America has to do today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  We must come together and stamp this evil out. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=423.9s)]
*  We must not give it space. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=428.84s)]
*  We must not give it breath. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=430.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=433.0s)]
*  They got to prosecute everybody who gets even close to this and steps over the line. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=434.94s)]
*  They got to deport the people that are here illegally or breaking the laws. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  And we got to do this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  And I don't think we can continue to fund at those high levels. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  Very quick last word, Professor Dershowitz. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=449.96s)]
*  We have to know that these kinds of riots on college campuses inevitably lead to shootings [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=453.52s)]
*  and killings. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=459.2s)]
*  I just published a new book called The Preventive State, in which I actually predicted, based [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=460.2s)]
*  on my experience in representing protesters in the 1970s, I predicted that these violent [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=464.88s)]
*  protesters on Harvard's campus and others would inevitably lead to people bombing, shooting [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=471.47999999999996s)]
*  and doing other kinds of things the way it did in the 60s. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=478.58s)]
*  So every one of us, Jew and non-Jew, is at risk if we don't stop these violent, violent [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=481.56s)]
*  demonstrations and these calls for antifascism. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=488.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=491.3s)]
*  Professor Dershowitz, Miranda Horace, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc8CbGk3SC0&t=492.94s)]
