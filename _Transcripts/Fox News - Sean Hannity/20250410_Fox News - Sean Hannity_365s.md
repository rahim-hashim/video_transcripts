# Sen.  Kennedy: An astounding thing happened here
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0)
*  The man who is calling today Trump's declaration of victory. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=0.0s)]
*  I got to spend time with him last night, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=3.64s)]
*  Senator, this is what you told me you wanted last night. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=7.76s)]
*  You got what you wanted. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=10.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=13.0s)]
*  And here's what I think most fair-minded Americans saw and have concluded. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=14.8s)]
*  With tariffs, an eye for an eye just makes both people blind. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=22.02s)]
*  Tariffs hurt both sides. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=28.04s)]
*  Number two, it's undeniable that many countries, included but not limited to China, have used [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=30.72s)]
*  tariffs in a way to hurt the American people. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=38.96s)]
*  And they've been doing it for a long time, since God was a child. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=42.68s)]
*  Number three, President Trump guided by the principle that if you're going to be a bear, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=49.44s)]
*  be a grizzly, hit back very, very hard. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=56.62s)]
*  Then fresh hell broke loose. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=62.419999999999995s)]
*  Most members of the media were saying that civilization is going to melt and that we're [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=67.02s)]
*  all going to be living in a refrigerator box behind Outback. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=73.94s)]
*  Then an astounding thing happened. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=78.66s)]
*  I thought that these countries were going to bow up and fight, but fully half of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=82.14s)]
*  countries in the entire world said, no moss. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=89.02s)]
*  They came to the president and said, we want to lower our trade barriers and make a deal. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=94.3s)]
*  I was astounded. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=100.94s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=103.94s)]
*  They could have bowed up and fought, but they decided— [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=105.1s)]
*  And then what happens to their manufacturing? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=109.14s)]
*  They need access to our markets. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=111.24s)]
*  They decided that it was in their best interests to make a deal, and the president wasn't [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  bluffing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  And he seized the opportunity. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, no reasonable—no person with an IQ above his age can believe that these [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  countries would have come to the table but for what President Trump did. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=133.44s)]
*  Now, some don't want to admit that, but it's the truth. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=139.54s)]
*  And you know, dealmaking is an art. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=142.94s)]
*  President Trump has clearly mastered the art. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=146.96s)]
*  It was an impressive couple of weeks. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=149.96s)]
*  I think you were a little shaken yourself at one point. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=154.22s)]
*  I was beginning to worry if you were going wobbly on me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=156.6s)]
*  But I think there's something much deeper in play here, and I want to get your thoughts [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=159.36s)]
*  on it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=163.28s)]
*  Now, this solidifies the Republican Party, the MAGA movement, as the party that represents [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=164.28s)]
*  working men and women in this country and is standing up for them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  And meanwhile, the Democratic Party is the party of coastal elites that choose Wall Street [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=176.2s)]
*  over Main Street. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=181.72s)]
*  And this is a dramatic shift. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=183.6s)]
*  Now the Republican Party represents the people that truly do make America great, the people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=185.96s)]
*  that work in those, the UAW workers, the steel workers, the manufacturers, the people, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=190.2s)]
*  you know, that work hard, play by the rules, pay their taxes, obey the laws, raise their [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=197.32s)]
*  kids, go to church on Sunday and, you know, and, you know, are fighting to put food on [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=201.28s)]
*  their table. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=207.2s)]
*  They're the ones that benefit, aren't they? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=208.2s)]
*  Yes, but I want to go back to your earlier comment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=211.2s)]
*  There was a sharp debate and disagreement in the White House. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  And had many advisors telling him, do not make a deal under any circumstances. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=219.76s)]
*  And I said very, I was very vociferous. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  I said, look, I don't know what the president's going to do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=229.12s)]
*  If it were me, I'd take the deal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=232.2s)]
*  And that's what he decided to do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=235.28s)]
*  Was that his plan all along? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=237.32s)]
*  It certainly looks like it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=239.0s)]
*  But let me say it again. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=241.88s)]
*  If you're going to be fair, no country who's come to the table would have come to the table [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=244.04s)]
*  but for the fact that President Trump did what he did. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=252.1s)]
*  And that's just a natural fact. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=256.94s)]
*  And I don't see how anybody, even those who hate the president, can disagree with him, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=258.52s)]
*  nor could they disagree with the proposition that it was an artful piece of dealmaking. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  You know what he was, what it was is the American people and all these countries know they've [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=271.0s)]
*  been ripping us off. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=277.32000000000005s)]
*  They know they've been taking advantage of us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=278.82000000000005s)]
*  And meanwhile, in the cases of our allies, we provide for their national defense. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=281.04s)]
*  We pay a lot more than they do. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=287.04s)]
*  For example, the European Union has no business putting a 10% tariff on our cars and a 20% [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  which raises the sticker price by 30%. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=296.64s)]
*  And no wonder we don't sell American cars in Europe. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=300.96s)]
*  It's over. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=304.64s)]
*  Those days are done. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=305.64s)]
*  You don't get to sell 10 cars here to our one car there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=306.64s)]
*  You know what else it was? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=310.28s)]
*  No one, Ryan said one time, the strikeout king, the press asked him, how did you do [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=311.94s)]
*  it? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=318.24s)]
*  How were you the strikeout king? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=319.24s)]
*  He said, it's real simple. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=320.24s)]
*  They never know whether or not I'm going to throw it their head. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=321.98s)]
*  And it gives me a little extra advantage. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=325.74s)]
*  I was a pitcher. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=330.26s)]
*  I sometimes hit people in the head, but it wasn't on purpose. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=331.42s)]
*  It was always an accident, never on purpose. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  I didn't have quite the control or speed that he did. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=337.26s)]
*  So it wasn't a big deal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=339.58000000000004s)]
*  Senator Kennedy, now you got to keep watching the show because we have a clip of you from [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=340.86s)]
*  last night that we're playing in the next segment. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  So I hope you keep watching. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=346.86s)]
*  I deny everything. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=347.86s)]
*  Whatever it is, I deny. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=349.26s)]
*  It's on videotape. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfC3jAodtR0&t=351.26s)]
