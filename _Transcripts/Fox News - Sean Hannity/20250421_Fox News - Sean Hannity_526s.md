# Hannity: Dems go from bad to worse
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM)
*  Welcome to Hannity and this Monday night we have a lot of ground to cover, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=0.0s)]
*  a special Hannity investigation tonight into far left elite universities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=10.28s)]
*  They believe they are above the law, entitled to tens of millions of your hard earned tax [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=15.56s)]
*  dollars in spite of multi-billion dollar endowments. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=20.44s)]
*  Oh, and now Harvard is suing our country, demanding even more of your money. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=24.76s)]
*  We've got the details. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=29.92s)]
*  We'll also introduce you to the Democratic Party's weird new plan to see more relatable. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=30.92s)]
*  The New York Times, they are defining this as dark woke. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=36.36s)]
*  We'll explain. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  And Congresswoman Nancy Mace filmed a very tense encounter with a man at a makeup store. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=41.24s)]
*  Here's a preview. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=46.96s)]
*  You're absolutely crazy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=47.96s)]
*  I'm absolutely crazy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=48.96s)]
*  And get out of my face. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=49.96s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=50.96s)]
*  You're insane. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=51.96s)]
*  You're going to be voted out so fast this year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=52.96s)]
*  I can't wait for you to fuck me. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=53.96s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=54.96s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=55.96s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=56.96s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=57.96s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=59.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=60.0s)]
*  I won by so much. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=61.0s)]
*  You're a disgrace to this state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=62.0s)]
*  That's what you are. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=63.0s)]
*  You're a disgrace. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=64.0s)]
*  I asked you a simple question and you just to go on this tirade and tell me fuck you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=68.0s)]
*  Get out of my face. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=69.0s)]
*  Get out of my face. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=70.0s)]
*  Try it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=72.0s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=73.0s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=74.0s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=75.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=76.0s)]
*  I sure did. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=77.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=80.0s)]
*  And coming up, Congresswoman Mace will join us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=81.0s)]
*  She'll give us her details. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=82.6s)]
*  And in our other news of the day segment, we're going to give you a huge, well, we're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=83.92s)]
*  going to give a huge thank you to President Trump, who saved all of you from another year [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=88.92s)]
*  of a very confused and confounded Joe Biden being led around the White House lawn by the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=92.8s)]
*  Easter Bunny. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=97.78s)]
*  Now it appears even the DNC is trying to purge Joe Biden's very strange Easter celebrations [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=98.78s)]
*  from their social media feeds. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  Only Jimmy Phelan will be able to explain that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  And buckle up for our video of the day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=109.88s)]
*  While brawl at a golf course, this is not a hockey rink that did not end well for that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=111.68s)]
*  shirtless guy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=117.62s)]
*  Didn't end well. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=118.62s)]
*  But we begin tonight, this Monday night, with bad news for the Democratic Party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=119.62s)]
*  Just when you think they can't get any worse, well, just when you think that they've hit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=123.82s)]
*  their bottom, they just keep digging. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=128.18s)]
*  According to a brand new Gallup poll, confidence in Democratic leadership just hit an all time [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=130.3s)]
*  low. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=135.54s)]
*  It has literally never been lower, ever. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=136.54s)]
*  Only 25% of respondents approve of the Democratic leaders in Congress. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=139.3s)]
*  That is a whopping nine points lower than the previous record low. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=144.22s)]
*  And get this, voters under 30, they are overwhelmingly shifting toward Republicans. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=148.46s)]
*  According to a Yale youth poll, voters age 18 to 21 now favor the GOP by double digits. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=153.86s)]
*  This has been a remarkable and reliable voting block for Democrats for decades now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=160.74s)]
*  But Congressman Jim Clyburn, he's now blaming the far left legacy media mob for not being [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=167.58s)]
*  helpful and supportive enough. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=173.38000000000002s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=175.5s)]
*  It's like state-run media. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=176.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=177.5s)]
*  Well, I think the message coming from the Democratic Party is a good message. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=178.5s)]
*  The problem we've got, Al, is that we have to depend upon the media to deliver it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  If we have the Washington Post, for instance, caving to this wannabe dictator, and we've [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=193.94s)]
*  got other media entities that seem to rather push a narrative that will bring eyes to their [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=202.34s)]
*  newspapers or to their television sets and not really give a fair hearing or reporting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  to what we're doing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  Let's get this straight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=223.22s)]
*  If only the abusively biased, Trump-hating journalists in the state-run legacy media [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=224.1s)]
*  mob were just a little more liberal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  All the Democrats' popularity woes, they would be solved instantaneously. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=231.54s)]
*  And as you can see, the left is totally out of touch. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=236.1s)]
*  Just look at Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who, you know, couldn't be bothered to talk about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  his own constituents. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  Patty Moran on the phone after her daughter, Rachel Moran, was brutally killed and raped [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  by an illegal immigrant on that Maryland hiking trail. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=251.06s)]
*  Or the family of another Maryland constituent, Kayla Hamilton. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  Same fate for her. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=257.62s)]
*  But Chris Van Hollen had all the time in the world for his trip to El Salvador, that you [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=258.9s)]
*  paid for, by the way, to meet lovingly with a deported illegal immigrant who was identified [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  as a possible gang member by two separate judges accused of human trafficking by police, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=270.34s)]
*  was a serial wife beater, according to his own wife in her own handwriting to police. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=275.94s)]
*  But in order to score some kind of political point against Donald Trump, Van Hollen was [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=281.94s)]
*  more than willing to look past all of these glaring red flags. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=286.82s)]
*  In fact, the senator didn't even bother to ask this guy whether, you know, his new [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=290.42s)]
*  friend was a member of MS-13. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=294.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=296.82s)]
*  Can you say with absolute certainty that he is not, nor has he ever been, a member of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=298.18s)]
*  the MS-13 gang? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=302.65999999999997s)]
*  And did you ask him point blank? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=303.94s)]
*  Well, Dana, what Donald Trump is trying to do here is change the subject. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=308.42s)]
*  The subject at hand is that he and his administration are defying a court order to give [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=313.06s)]
*  Abrego Garcia his due process rights. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=321.62s)]
*  But since you were the one person to have met with him, and since this is a thing—you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=324.98s)]
*  say on social media, it's what we hear from Donald Trump and Republicans every day, all [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=330.26s)]
*  day long—you didn't ask him? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  I didn't ask him that because I know what his answer is. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  What he told me was he was sad, traumatized that he was being in prison because he has [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=341.3s)]
*  committed no crimes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=348.02000000000004s)]
*  Oh, okay, entering the country illegally is not a crime anymore, thanks to Chris Van Hollen. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=350.5s)]
*  He obviously doesn't care if he's a violent gang member. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=355.62s)]
*  He just wants him back in the U.S. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=358.42s)]
*  Maybe he'll let him move into his house. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=360.42s)]
*  In fact, most Democrats seem to want the same thing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=362.26000000000005s)]
*  Even Tim Wall's daughter compared this to a legal immigrant. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=365.38000000000005s)]
*  If you can believe it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=369.38000000000005s)]
*  The day after Easter, we're reporting on this to Jesus. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=370.58s)]
*  Now today, four more Democratic lawmakers, they have now traveled themselves to El Salvador [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=373.7s)]
*  in a desperate attempt to meet with their new hero. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=378.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=381.14s)]
*  More importantly, we're here to raise awareness that Kilmar needs to come home, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=382.5s)]
*  need to build support here in El Salvador, but also in the United States. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=387.38s)]
*  He must come home. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  This is not just a threat to all people in the United States who could be illegally [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=393.29999999999995s)]
*  abducted, detained and transported internationally against their will. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=400.18s)]
*  We have to draw the line here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=405.14s)]
*  We have to make a big deal about this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=407.22s)]
*  Members of Congress have to come here and use the privilege we have to advocate at the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=409.38s)]
*  highest levels to make sure that Kilmar is brought home. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=414.1s)]
*  Why didn't they raise awareness when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had wide open borders, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  known terrorists, known murderers, rapists, gang members, cartel members, 10 to 14 to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=422.98s)]
*  100 million illegals entering our country? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGLuxWwUbaM&t=428.9s)]
