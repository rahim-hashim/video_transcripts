# ‘MONUMENTAL’: Miller labels Trump admin’s deportation legal win as the ‘biggest’ yet
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw)
*  Deputy Chief of Policy, Homeland Security Advisor, our friend Stephen Miller. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=0.0s)]
*  Stephen, it's even bigger than that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  The Supreme Court brutally slapped this down. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=6.18s)]
*  And they did cite the 1948 Supreme Court decision, which I had cited many times, that stated [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=11.3s)]
*  very affirmatively—four presidents had used it—that once the president made that decision [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=18.38s)]
*  and invoked this act, that it was his constitutional authority to do it, number one, and number [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=23.82s)]
*  two, it was not subject to judicial review. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=29.86s)]
*  And that was the case. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=32.9s)]
*  The court got it right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=34.26s)]
*  It should have been 9-0, but it was 5-4. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=35.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=37.66s)]
*  Well, once again, Sean, your legal analysis was spot on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=38.66s)]
*  Your historical precedence, your case law was exactly right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=44.94s)]
*  So great credit to you for calling every element of that exactly correctly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=47.78s)]
*  This was a huge, I mean, a monumental victory for President Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  The biggest legal win of this administration so far. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=57.38s)]
*  A total embarrassment for crazy Judge Boasberg, who's been trying to force this president [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=60.900000000000006s)]
*  to bring foreign alien terrorists back onto American soil, trying to turn our planes around, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=67.18s)]
*  trying to empty prisons in foreign countries and bring them back to our soil. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=72.94s)]
*  This is a monumental, colossal victory for the rule of law, for the Constitution, for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  our founding generation, John Adams, who signed this law into effect in 1798 and for President [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=83.94s)]
*  Trump in fulfilling his mandate and campaign pledge. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=90.3s)]
*  What does this mean for you and your family watching at home tonight? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=93.22s)]
*  It means that the Department of Justice, FBI, DEA, ATF, the U.S. Marshals Service, Customs [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=96.9s)]
*  and Border Protection, Border Patrol, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement now have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  authority to find and remove illegal alien gang members from Venezuela that have been [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=109.68s)]
*  responsible for so much misery in this country, for the torture and murder of Jocelyn Nungeri, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=114.84s)]
*  for the brutal slaying of Lake and Riley. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  Those monsters can now be hunted down and expelled from this country with speed, force [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  and efficiency. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=131.12s)]
*  This is a great day for America, Sean. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=132.12s)]
*  The court also held that the case should not have gone to D.C. since the plaintiffs were [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=134.78s)]
*  in Texas, and to me that's a repudiation against judge shopping. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=140.74s)]
*  So I think that's another big win, because that is a tactic. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=144.62s)]
*  What the left can't get done electorally or legislatively, they run to judicial activists [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=147.74s)]
*  on the court to try and get it done that way. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  So I think that's a blow to that process and that strategy that they use. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=156.62s)]
*  Oh, without question. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=161.38s)]
*  So you talk about it many times, Sean, judge shopping, form shopping. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=163.9s)]
*  So the radical left lawyers like the ACLU will search for the most lunatic left judges [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=167.98s)]
*  in the whole country to try to shut down the president's action, even if there are no plaintiffs [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=174.0s)]
*  where that judge is operating. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=180.06s)]
*  In this case, we had illegal aliens who were part of a designated foreign terrorist organization [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=181.9s)]
*  who had been declared alien enemies in Texas, and they were suing us in D.C. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=187.22s)]
*  This judge should have mooted out the case the second it was filed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=193.22s)]
*  So instead the Supreme Court mooted it out for him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=196.9s)]
*  And what it means is that now all of these crazy left judges are on notice that President [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=200.32s)]
*  Trump is fighting back against lawfare, he's fighting it back against judge shopping and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=205.54s)]
*  form shopping, and we're going to protect the powers of the president and we're going [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=210.38s)]
*  to protect the people of this country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  You and I, Sean, have spent many hours with victims who have been murdered by the illegal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=216.74s)]
*  aliens let into this country by Democrats. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=221.5s)]
*  President Trump has hugged them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=224.1s)]
*  He's held their hands. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=225.54s)]
*  He's looked into their eyes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  He's promised he has promised them that their loved ones will not have died in vain. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=228.06s)]
*  He is fulfilling that oath and that obligation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=232.82s)]
*  And with this ruling, he will be empowered to keep America safe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  All right, Stephen Miller, we appreciate it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=240.82s)]
*  This is a big one for the president. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjA5lR41TEw&t=244.89999999999998s)]
