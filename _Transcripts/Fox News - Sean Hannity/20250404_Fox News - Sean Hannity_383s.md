# Tom Homan to doxxers: I won't be bullied or intimidated
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0)
*  All right, the left, they just cannot handle the fact that President Trump is keeping all [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=0.0s)]
*  his promises on immigration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=4.46s)]
*  In fact, in the liberal sanctuary city of Boston, they're now trying to charge an ICE [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=5.8s)]
*  agent—an ICE agent—with crimes just because he did his job and arrested an illegal immigrant. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=10.56s)]
*  The DA in Suffolk County says that the ICE agent arrested the illegal in the middle of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=16.88s)]
*  a trial, which supposedly deprived the illegal of his rights. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=22.2s)]
*  And a judge even held the agent in contempt over the arrest. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=26.4s)]
*  But the U.S. attorney in Massachusetts said that the judge's contempt order cannot be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  enforced because the Constitution clearly protects federal officers from prosecution [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=34.32s)]
*  just for carrying out their official duties. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=40.46s)]
*  And as the U.S. attorney points out, this arrest was totally justified. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=43.58s)]
*  The illegal had prior arrests for serious drug trafficking offenses—you know, the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=47.84s)]
*  ones that kill your kids—and was arrested with a valid federal warrant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=52.92s)]
*  And, of course, the federal judges in D.C. are no better. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=56.68s)]
*  The judge trying to stop Trump from using the Supreme Court upheld the Alien Enemies [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=60.08s)]
*  Act to deport illegals held to hearing today as he tries to decide whether to hold Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=65.62s)]
*  administration in contempt for deporting illegal immigrants, in this case, Trende Aragua gang [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=70.84s)]
*  members. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=77.16s)]
*  But the Trump team, they are undeterred, and they keep getting results. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=78.16s)]
*  The illegal crossings at the southern border last month were down to just 7,000 in March, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=82.48s)]
*  down from nearly 200,000 in March of last year. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=87.64s)]
*  How does the left respond? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=91.48s)]
*  Holding a protest, as usual, this weekend in upstate New York that includes a planned [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=93.04s)]
*  march past the home of border czar Tom Homan, who joins us right now with much more. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=98.84s)]
*  This doxing thing, if it keeps going on and it's now happening to you, somebody's going [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=105.54s)]
*  to get killed here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=110.92s)]
*  You're doing it to Supreme Court justices, elected officials. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=112.36s)]
*  You see what's happening at Tesla dealerships and charging stations around the country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=116.04s)]
*  What's your reaction now that it's happening to you? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=121.04s)]
*  Well, look, I'm not going to be bullied, I'm not going to be intimidated. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=125.04s)]
*  We won't keep doing what we're doing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=128.04s)]
*  Like you said, the border numbers are a historic low. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=129.72s)]
*  Sean, I started in 1984 as a border agent. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=132.04s)]
*  I've never seen the numbers this low. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=134.64s)]
*  This is historic. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=136.82s)]
*  And tomorrow, ICE is going to hit 50,000 arrests in the interior and more than 35,000 are significant [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=138.72s)]
*  public safety threats. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=145.22s)]
*  I was looking at the numbers earlier. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=146.22s)]
*  3,749 dangerous drug convictions, 1,042 aliens with weapons convictions, 969 illegal aliens [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=148.22s)]
*  with sexual assault convictions, 379 murder convictions. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  So we're hitting the ground running. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=162.66s)]
*  We're not going to stop. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=164.06s)]
*  Based on what you just talked about, Lindsey Graham, I want to double down what you said, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=166.38s)]
*  Sean. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=169.14s)]
*  If we don't get the money, we can't arrest the most significant public safety threats [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=170.14s)]
*  in this country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=174.38s)]
*  We need money to do the operations. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=175.38s)]
*  We need money to buy beds. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=176.38s)]
*  We need money for airplane flights. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=178.18s)]
*  We need money to detail agents to sanctuary cities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=179.62s)]
*  We need money or this stuff's going to slow down. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=182.18s)]
*  What do you make of the DA in Suffolk County in Massachusetts that says the ICE agent arrested [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=185.42s)]
*  the illegal in the middle of a trial and deprived the illegal of his rights? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=191.73999999999998s)]
*  I know it ended the way it should, but he's doing his job and he has jurisdiction over [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  local jurisdiction. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=203.66s)]
*  It's pretty outrageous that the people that are aiding and abetting illegals vis-a-vis [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  sanctuary cities and states, that they never get held accountable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=212.33999999999997s)]
*  I think that's got to be the next step, no? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know, DOJ's going to take it on. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=217.66s)]
*  They'll win the case, but I'm proud of that agent. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=221.7s)]
*  They did exactly what he should have done. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=223.7s)]
*  He took a dangerous person off the street because he would have been released. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=225.06s)]
*  He would have gotten bail. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=228.14s)]
*  It's a sanctuary state. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=229.62s)]
*  The judge will lose this, and I hope the judge gets embarrassed on this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=232.62s)]
*  Federal law is always going to trump local law, so God bless that agent for sticking [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=235.98s)]
*  to his willpower and taking this person in custody. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=240.1s)]
*  There's one less bad guy in the street. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=242.94s)]
*  Every bad guy we take off the street makes this country safe. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=244.88s)]
*  President Trump made a promise to American people, we're going to make this country [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=248.64s)]
*  safe again. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=251.04s)]
*  We're going to start with foreign nationals, foreign illegal aliens that commit crimes [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=252.04s)]
*  in this country, and we're doing exactly what Trump promised. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  We're keeping his promise. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=258.2s)]
*  We're making this country safe again. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=259.2s)]
*  One day at a time, one illegal alien at a time, we're going to keep going. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=261.0s)]
*  All right, a couple of other updates. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=264.6s)]
*  You have this crazed nutjob who posted a video online encouraging people to open fire on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=267.02s)]
*  ICE agents. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=272.32s)]
*  That individual has been arrested for making terrorist threats. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=273.72s)]
*  You also have in Long Island, New York, ICE agents capture an MS-13 gangbanger serial [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  killer. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  What can you tell us about those two cases? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, look, the one making threats against federal officers, he needs to be arrested, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=287.72s)]
*  he needs to be locked up, and hopefully that sends a message. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  If you want to threaten ICE officers, if you want to come to my home this weekend and try [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=296.56s)]
*  to terrorize my family, you're going to be held accountable. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=301.88s)]
*  People have the right to protest and they have their First Amendment rights, but you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=304.0s)]
*  don't have a right to dox federal agents. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=307.68s)]
*  You don't have a right to threaten their safety or their family's safety. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=309.88s)]
*  While I'm talking to you right now, Sean, I have Virginia state troopers 24-7 around [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=313.24s)]
*  my home because death threats can be my family. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=317.6s)]
*  They just don't get it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=320.04s)]
*  Like I said earlier, I'm not going to be bullied. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=321.04s)]
*  I'm not going to be intimidated. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=322.52s)]
*  I'm going to keep doing my job, but it's just unfortunate that we've got to spend all this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=323.52s)]
*  money and resources to protect agents who are simply enforcing the law. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=328.64s)]
*  We're at a point now where the ones who carry the badge and gun, the ones who enforce the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=331.64s)]
*  law, they're the bad guys now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  And the ones who break the law are the victims? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=336.64s)]
*  The whole world's upside down. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=339.0s)]
*  Thank God we got President Trump back in the Oval Office. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=340.4s)]
*  He's going to turn this back around where it's supposed to be. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=342.28s)]
*  Law enforcement will respect it again and the bad guys are on the run and they should [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=345.44s)]
*  be on the run and we're going to not stop looking for them. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=349.0s)]
*  So again, thank God we got President Trump back in the Oval Office because things are [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=351.36s)]
*  going to change quickly. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=355.24s)]
*  They already are. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=356.24s)]
*  Thank God we have tough guys like you too that can take this heat. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=357.76s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=361.72s)]
*  It's not good for your family. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=362.72s)]
*  I'm sure it's not pleasant, but they're messing with the wrong guy. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=363.72s)]
*  I can tell I'm not up front. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=367.76s)]
*  Tom Homan, thank you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=369.32s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGQgAxDutu0&t=370.44s)]
