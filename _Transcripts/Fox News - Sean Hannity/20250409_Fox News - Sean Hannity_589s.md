# Hannity: America is not going to be pushed around any longer
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o)
*  Art of the deal, told you this was going to happen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=0.0s)]
*  It was inevitable. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=2.88s)]
*  Donald Trump's in a perpetual state of negotiation, a huge win for the president, a huge win for [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=3.96s)]
*  the country, his biggest accomplishment of the second term, and there have been many. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=8.96s)]
*  Take a look at all the progress from this president just over the last, you know, few [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=13.86s)]
*  months at office. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=18.3s)]
*  And now, once again, the haters, the doubters, the legacy media mob, the chicken littles, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=19.52s)]
*  the Democrats, all the people on the left wing, they were all proven wrong, screaming [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=24.92s)]
*  and yelling and ranting and raving. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  They all, as usual, end up with egg on their face. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=30.86s)]
*  Exactly one week after Liberation Day, the stock market closed with its third biggest [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  overall gain since World War II. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=39.64s)]
*  S&P up nearly 10 percent, the Dow Jones up nearly 8 percent, with the biggest point increase [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=42.0s)]
*  in American history in a single day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  The Nasdaq, well, that jumped by more than 12 percent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=50.16s)]
*  Now, the Democrats rallied after President Trump announced an immediate 90-day pause [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=55.0s)]
*  on his stated reciprocal tariffs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=58.0s)]
*  Why did he, why was he able to pause this? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=61.0s)]
*  Now, this is for every country that chose not to retaliate, which he warned against, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=63.0s)]
*  against our country, and instead, they were lining up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=68.16s)]
*  They were offering, and in many cases, begging and pleading with President Trump, let's negotiate [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  free and fair trade agreements. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  So, basically, Donald Trump won, and he will win in these negotiations as well. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=79.52s)]
*  Instead of starting a trade war, Donald Trump used the strength of our country, used his [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=85.68s)]
*  strength, put his political capital on the line, something a lot of people in Washington [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  really don't like to do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=95.56s)]
*  Drew a line in the sand said very clearly, unequivocally, the days of ripping off the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=96.84s)]
*  American people and America is over. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  The days of taking advantage of this country, it is over. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=107.24s)]
*  The days of abusing our country is over. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=111.46s)]
*  Donald Trump knew these countries, they desperately need access to our markets, they want your [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  money. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  So over 75 countries, they're now begging to make a deal with Donald Trump for free [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  and fair trade. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=126.0s)]
*  And pretty soon, American goods will be more competitive all across the globe. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=127.28s)]
*  That's good for the American economy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=131.8s)]
*  And by the way, these countries would be very wise if you're watching internationally, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=134.4s)]
*  you should seek out your deal as soon as possible. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=140.0s)]
*  I'm going to make a prediction. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=142.48s)]
*  The first 15 deals will be much more favorable than the last 15 deals. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=144.56s)]
*  Just a guess, but what do I know? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=149.56s)]
*  I'm just a talk show host. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=150.56s)]
*  Now, the longer they wait, the higher the price will be. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=151.92s)]
*  But don't forget, dozens of foreign countries, multinational businesses, they have already [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=155.12s)]
*  announced a whoppingâ€”look at this list. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=159.92s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=162.92s)]
*  They have already announced a whopping $5 to $7 trillion just by the threat of implementing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  That's money that's going to be spent in infrastructure, manufacturing, auto plants, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  chip companies right here in the United States of America. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=178.76s)]
*  In order to avoid any trade uncertainty. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=179.76s)]
*  They're like, yeah, let's build in America. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=181.76s)]
*  Perfect time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=183.48s)]
*  Donald Trump's in office. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=184.48s)]
*  Now, this means more high-paying career jobs for the American people. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=185.48s)]
*  That means more industry. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=190.16s)]
*  That means less dependence on other nations. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=192.08s)]
*  For example, we're far too dependent on other countries for pharmaceuticals. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=195.0s)]
*  Oh, what if COVID-2.0, God forbid, happens? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=199.2s)]
*  We're too dependent on getting semiconductors abroad. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=202.4s)]
*  We're going to make them here in America. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=205.4s)]
*  By the way, this is going to be the new normal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=207.6s)]
*  The old establishment, institutionalist mindset is now officially dead. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=211.04s)]
*  This is what America first looks like. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=217.36s)]
*  This is what it means to be strong. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  This is what it means that America's not going to be pushed around any longer. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=222.28s)]
*  And there was even more good news tonight. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=226.52s)]
*  Communist China, they're finally getting held accountable. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=228.12s)]
*  I'm pretty happy about it, and I'll explain in a second. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  Unlike Americans, you know, and partners, let's take a look first. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=234.28s)]
*  This was driven by the president's strategy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  He and I had a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  You might even say that he goaded China into a bad position. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=248.28s)]
*  They responded. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  And we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading partners, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  who did not retaliate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't a hard message. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=267.2s)]
*  Don't retaliate. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=269.08s)]
*  Things will turn out well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=270.08s)]
*  That was the message. It's pretty clear. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=272.48s)]
*  If you want free and fair trade, you can have it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=274.32s)]
*  If you want reciprocal tariffs, you can have that, too. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=276.44s)]
*  If you want to try and take advantage of America, that you can't have. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  Unlike the partners that we have around the globe, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=283.28s)]
*  China has no interest in good faith negotiations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  They have shown no good faith negotiations up till now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=289.32s)]
*  That may change. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  Now they started a trade war that, frankly, China cannot win. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=293.96s)]
*  President Xi, let me tell you, if you hear about this show somewhere in China, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=298.32s)]
*  at some point in the coming days, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=302.76s)]
*  you are playing chicken with the wrong guy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  Even before Trump's latest 125% tariff on your country, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=307.44s)]
*  China's currency was already crashing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=311.88s)]
*  It's now at the lowest point since 2007. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=314.2s)]
*  It is going lower. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=317.12s)]
*  And mark my words, President Xi will be begging for access to America's markets [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  as he watches one country after another, after another, after another, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=323.48s)]
*  make a free and fair trade deal with the United States of America. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=327.64s)]
*  China's economy also depends on America's lucrative market. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=331.16s)]
*  They want your money, too. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=335.72s)]
*  Everybody around the world wants your money. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=337.04s)]
*  They need us to buy their cheap products in bulk. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=339.12s)]
*  Millions of Chinese citizens will be out of work without our whole cold hard cash. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=342.6s)]
*  They'll be stuck. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=349.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, China's retaliatory tariffs, they don't have a huge impact on the U.S. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=350.56s)]
*  They've been ripping us off for decades. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=354.88s)]
*  Now just look at what they do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=356.76s)]
*  Look at what they charge us. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  Look at how they have abused us. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  Look at how they rip you off. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=363.56s)]
*  And we've allowed this to happen for 50 or 60 years. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=365.64s)]
*  How stupid are we? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=368.72s)]
*  This is now coming to an end. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=370.24s)]
*  Well before Donald Trump, the CCP imposed massive tariffs against American products. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=371.92s)]
*  Look at that. Look at everything that you can think of, you know, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=377.16s)]
*  and that prevents us from competing in China. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=380.76s)]
*  They won't allow our products in China. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=383.32s)]
*  But this is about so much more than trade. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=385.44s)]
*  The Communist Party of China, they are a ruthless, sloppy adversary [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=388.16s)]
*  that continually harms the American people and our allies around the globe. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwDu8kq99o&t=393.32s)]
