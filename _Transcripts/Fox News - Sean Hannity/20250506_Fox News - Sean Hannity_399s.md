# Karoline Leavitt: This was a 'despicable' interview by CNN
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q)
*  Time for our Hannity Washington White House briefing White House press secretary Caroline Levitt is with us Caroline. Thank you Alcatraz. Tell me more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to see you Sean. Thank you so much [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=10.28s)]
*  And this is a phenomenal idea by President Trump that will be executed upon [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=12.3s)]
*  In fact, I can confirm for you that the White House has already administered calls with the Bureau of Prisons our [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=16.8s)]
*  counterparts at the Department of Justice and our [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=23.6s)]
*  counterparts at the Department of Interior because Alcatraz is now run by the National Park Service and we know our great Secretary of Interior [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=26.44s)]
*  Doug Burgum is in charge of that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=32.72s)]
*  so the Bureau of Prisons has already confirmed that they are assessing next steps to reopen this notorious prison and the reason for it is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=35.02s)]
*  Because President Trump is leaving no stone unturned to restore law and order to our country and to make it very clear [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=43.36s)]
*  to criminals repeat offenders [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=50.6s)]
*  Not just illegal immigrant criminals [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=52.9s)]
*  But also American citizens who have refused to comply with our nation's laws if you have been [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=55.22s)]
*  Repeatedly breaking the law if you are in and out of prison that is ending under this administration [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=61.5s)]
*  President Trump's team is going to enforce our laws and prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=67.26s)]
*  So we are absolutely looking into this assessing next steps and it's a part of the president's big-picture law and order agenda [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=72.74s)]
*  Which is obviously working [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=79.94s)]
*  Especially when you look at the illegal border crossings at our southern border the border is secure [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=81.82s)]
*  Mass deportations are underway and law and order is back in America. Thanks to President Trump [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=86.77999999999999s)]
*  Caroline, what did you and the administration make of the Sinaloa? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=92.74s)]
*  Cartel gang member interviewed on CNN. Why would they care what he thinks? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=96.82s)]
*  Well, it was fascinating to me Sean [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=104.06s)]
*  I was actually scrolling on Instagram when I came across this interview and it stopped me in my tracks [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=106.66s)]
*  Not just because they sat down with a member of a Mexican cartel that is now designated as a foreign terrorist organization [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=112.3s)]
*  By the United States government but because of the nature of the questions of this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=119.13999999999999s)]
*  notorious foreign terrorists [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=125.02s)]
*  It was a softball interview giving a platform to a notorious drug cartel that has killed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=127.1s)]
*  American citizens, I thought it was quite despicable [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=134.45999999999998s)]
*  But again, this is just another reason why the the trust in the legacy media as an all-time low amongst the American public [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=137.14s)]
*  Well, you know Caroline things are changing dramatically in inside the the press briefing room [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  You'll have a lot of new media that you have invited in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=151.78s)]
*  I thought it was very clever when when you walk in the White House in the front gate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=154.06s)]
*  You see that this sort of like a media row and all the different networks have the little spot and then behind them [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  You put up posters of people that committed the most heinous crimes against Americans [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  For most of those networks that might be the first time that people are learning about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=170.28s)]
*  The number of crimes that murders and rapes and violent crimes committed by people because they didn't really report on it that often [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  And then a lot of a lot of chatter today about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=182.88s)]
*  Quote the White House's own drudge report you have decided to put out your own information [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=185.96s)]
*  That people can now bypass the media and go directly to what you're saying about the different issues [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=191.88s)]
*  And what the president's doing a whole new approach to media. Tell me about it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=196.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely Sean and it's because President Trump has [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Revolutionized media and the way Americans consume media [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=206.76s)]
*  He started this on the campaign when he opened the campaign to social media influencers and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=210.78s)]
*  podcasters and he was willing to take that non-traditional media route and we have continued that effort at the White House and it's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=217.54s)]
*  Sad truly that we have to put mugshots of illegal alien criminals on the front lawn of the White House in order for the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=224.98s)]
*  Mainstream media to actually cover these stories. They should be covering them [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  But because they do not we will put them right in their faces and it drew a lot of attention as it should last [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=236.74s)]
*  week at the White House [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=243.06s)]
*  I met with angel mothers whose names your audience may not know because they are living in silence [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=244.02s)]
*  They are living in in in a tragic circumstance where their children were taken away from them by illegal alien criminals and no [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=250.5s)]
*  Politician they told me until Donald Trump cared about their stories cared about listening to them [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=258.14s)]
*  So we had them at the White House last week for a listening session [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=263.58000000000004s)]
*  We're going to continue to engage with with these angel parents who have lost their children as a result of the Democrats open border [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=266.66s)]
*  policies and every day we are reminded by their testimony their stories the lives of their loved ones law-abiding [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  American citizens who should still be with us when we are mass supporting illegal alien criminals from our nation's interior [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=281.18s)]
*  Those efforts continue as you just saw from the Secretary of Homeland Security [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=288.42s)]
*  We are encouraging illegal aliens in the interior of our country to self-deport [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=292.26000000000005s)]
*  Ice is conducting successful operations on the ground and communities across the country [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=297.66s)]
*  But if you are here illegally do the right thing and go home this president and this administration are enforcing our nation's immigration laws on [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=303.14000000000004s)]
*  behalf of the law-abiding American citizens who want to trust our system of justice [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=310.98s)]
*  But especially on behalf of those who have tragically lost their lives at the hands of violent illegal criminals [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=315.5s)]
*  Last question Wall Street had just had as long as winning Street since 2004 [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=322.54s)]
*  it has slight dip today, but leading up to today and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=328.38000000000005s)]
*  I guess people want to know the status of trade deals. We had Scott Besson on the program last week [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=332.26000000000005s)]
*  He said there are 17 identified countries to go first and he's very confident that they're getting closer to making these trade deals and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=338.5s)]
*  Resolving the tariff issues. Can you update us on that? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=345.98s)]
*  The trade deals are continuing to move along in a positive and productive [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=348.74s)]
*  Direction the Secretary of Treasury Secretary of Commerce the president himself continued to be engaged on this every single day [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=353.38s)]
*  Keeping in mind the American worker and reshoring jobs here at home. You had a new announcement from the president yesterday [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=360.82s)]
*  Tariffs on the film industry. We're going to make Hollywood great again [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=368.26s)]
*  And it's just one of the many great proposals the president has had of taking the role of the American people [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  As the president has had to make our country boom again and to bring jobs back here at home [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXUUyrUc5Q&t=377.22s)]
