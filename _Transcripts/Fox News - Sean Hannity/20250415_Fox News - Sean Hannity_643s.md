# Dems are in desperate need of a ‘reboot’: Hannity
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight under President Trump the state of our union is strong and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=0.0s)]
*  well sadly for liberals it's getting stronger. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=5.3s)]
*  Yet Democrats across the country have never been more miserable. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=8.06s)]
*  They hate his free and fair trade negotiations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=11.52s)]
*  They can't stomach it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=14.22s)]
*  It's too hard. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=15.22s)]
*  Well, why would we demand free and fair trade? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=16.22s)]
*  They hate his efforts to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=19.44s)]
*  They hate Elon Musk. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=22.02s)]
*  They hate that he is securing the southern border. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=23.18s)]
*  You know, we allowed in terrorists, known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=26.36s)]
*  gang members. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=31.0s)]
*  Why would we want to keep them? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=32.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't we want to keep them? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=33.96s)]
*  They really seem to hate that the president is taking violent criminal illegal immigrants [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=35.84s)]
*  that Joe and Kamala Harris allowed into the country off the streets, booting them out [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=39.96s)]
*  of our country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  They never should have been here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Now coming up, Patty Moore will join us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=47.32s)]
*  You might recall her daughter, Rachel, a mother of five, brutally killed on a Maryland hiking [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=49.36s)]
*  trail by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who was just convicted of first degree murder [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=54.92s)]
*  and first degree rape. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  Sadly, you won't hear much about this horrific case from Democrats. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=61.64s)]
*  They're too busy worrying about another illegal immigrant from El Salvador, a reported gang [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=65.92s)]
*  member, according to a judge, who recently was deported back to his home country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  We'll have a lot more on the shameless hypocrisy in less than a minute. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=76.56s)]
*  Also tonight, we will dive into the president's economic strategy with Dave Ramsey and John [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  Solomon has a new report tonight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=84.92s)]
*  That's right, involving New York Attorney General Letitia James. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=87.84s)]
*  And in our other News of the Day segment, out of work, well, frankly, nut job, Keith [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=92.16s)]
*  Olbermann is having another meltdown. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=98.56s)]
*  The angriest guy on social media, this time directed at Kristi Noem, Tom Homan, and also [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=99.56s)]
*  our video of the night, a special announcement from fake news CNN, according to Dana Bash. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=104.92s)]
*  Fox News alert. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  They don't actually hate America. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  As always, we report, we'll let you decide. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=114.54s)]
*  And by the way, after our monologue, we'll check in in just a moment with Stephen A. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=117.5s)]
*  Smith, who is going to tell you why he now feels compelled that he must consider a run [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=121.06s)]
*  for the presidency and to save the Democratic Party. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=127.78s)]
*  This should be interesting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=131.82s)]
*  But let's be honest, the Democratic Party, they are in desperate need of a reboot. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=132.82s)]
*  No doubt about that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=137.7s)]
*  This is a deeply broken, a deeply troubled party. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=139.06s)]
*  Let's take a look at the topic of illegal immigration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=142.02s)]
*  Under Biden, Rachel Moran, Jocelyn Nungary, Lakin Reilly and so many other women were [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=144.34s)]
*  murdered by illegals and many others were raped and others were victims of violent crimes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=150.7s)]
*  But Democrats showed little to zero compassion or interest in these cases. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=155.98s)]
*  They didn't even bother to stand up during the president's joint address when he honored [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=161.26s)]
*  the mothers of two women that lost their lives to Harris Biden illegals. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=166.22s)]
*  And take a look at this post on X. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=171.94s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=173.82s)]
*  When Rachel Moran, an actual Maryland mother, was killed by an illegal gang member, the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=174.82s)]
*  only thing Chris Van Hollen did was give a statement to a news outlet. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=179.54s)]
*  But when an illegal from El Salvador gets deported, he's ready to fly down to El Salvador [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  to free his constituent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen wouldn't lift a finger to secure the southern border [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=192.78s)]
*  or even visit the southern border after a Maryland mother of five was raped and murdered [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=196.82000000000002s)]
*  on a Maryland hiking trail. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=202.06s)]
*  But he's now up in arms because an illegal immigrant from El Salvador was deported back [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=204.62s)]
*  to his home country of El Salvador. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=210.74s)]
*  Chris, you're really serious about this because maybe maybe he can move in with you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=217.62s)]
*  I don't even know if we announced this, but I am planning tomorrow to go to El Salvador [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=218.78s)]
*  to work to bring him home. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=223.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=240.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=245.02s)]
*  I heard that, but I didn't know that was public. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  Bring them all home. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=256.42s)]
*  Bring all the illegals from El Salvador home. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=257.42s)]
*  Doesn't matter if they're gang members or not. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=260.02s)]
*  We'll find out how Rachel Moran's mother feels about this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=261.82s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=264.82s)]
*  This is a party full of lunatics and who seem to value the comfort of an illegal immigrant [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=266.02s)]
*  over you, law-abiding, peaceful American citizens. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=273.32s)]
*  And let's be very clear about something. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  This illegal immigrant in question is not a Maryland man. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  That is misinformation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=282.36s)]
*  That is fake news currently spreading like wildfire in the legacy media mob. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=283.96s)]
*  According to the White House, this is a gang member who is most definitely not from Maryland [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=288.88s)]
*  and he does not have a right to be in Maryland or anywhere else in this country. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=294.6s)]
*  of El Salvador and is currently in his home country thanks to Donald Trump and his administration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  And now in other news, Barack Obama, he's busy with another cause. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=306.44s)]
*  He's now rushing to the defense of Harvard University. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=309.84s)]
*  Obama's very deeply troubled that Harvard may not receive their usual multibillion dollar [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=313.11999999999995s)]
*  payout with your money from the federal government after rejecting Donald Trump's federal mandate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=319.44s)]
*  That requires universities to eliminate DEI, reject anti-Semitism on college campuses. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=325.64s)]
*  The administration froze $2.2 billion in your tax dollars. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=332.04s)]
*  So my question tonight, why is Harvard receiving any of your hard earned tax dollars when we [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=336.52s)]
*  have 37 trillion in debt? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=342.94s)]
*  You know, the school has the largest institutional endowment in the country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=345.12s)]
*  They have a whopping $53 billion stashed away. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=349.76s)]
*  And it costs nearly $80,000 a year to attend this private prestigious university. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=354.16s)]
*  So why is the federal government giving them a penny? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  And with bullets flying in Obama's hometown of Chicago, why is this his cause celeb? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=363.56s)]
*  Why is this so important to him? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=369.0s)]
*  This is a party of woke elites for woke elites. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=371.0s)]
*  Now they're simply not concerned with serious issues that impact most Americans. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=374.56s)]
*  That is why their approval numbers are lower than they've ever been. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=378.90000000000003s)]
*  Even in the deep blue state of California, Kamala Harris is now struggling to get political [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=382.6s)]
*  traction ahead of a possible run for governor. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=387.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, breaking tonight, more troubling news for Democrats. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=390.48s)]
*  According to a report from John Solomon and other news sources, the left's one-time big [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  savior is in legal trouble. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=399.32000000000005s)]
*  The left's one-time, yep, the head of legal trouble. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=401.68s)]
*  Anyway, a criminal referral has been issued from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  has been filed against New York Attorney General Letitia James. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=411.12s)]
*  Now, based on this reporting, James is accused of falsifying records to receive more favorable [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  loan terms. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  John Solomon will have a full report coming up later in the show. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=421.36s)]
*  And tonight, the bad news for Democrats does not stop there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=424.16s)]
*  After enjoying quite a bit of rest and relaxation after leaving office, Joe Biden is out of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  hibernation and he's speaking in public. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=433.74s)]
*  Let's just say that today's speech did not go very well. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=436.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=440.02000000000004s)]
*  It's about dignity. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=441.68s)]
*  Simple dignity. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=443.68s)]
*  Everyone, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, regardless of their standing, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=445.68s)]
*  regardless of their economic status, regardless of who they are. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=452.48s)]
*  Fewer than 100 days, this new administration has made so much, done so much damage and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  so much destruction. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  They've taken a hatchet into the Social Security Administration, pushing an additional 7,000 [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=469.44s)]
*  employees, 7,000 out the door in that time. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=475.28s)]
*  We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=479.6s)]
*  Like I said, I've been doing this a long time. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=485.04s)]
*  It's never been this divided. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=488.08s)]
*  Granted, it's roughly 30 percent, but it's a 30 percent that has no heart. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=492.72s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=497.36s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=499.36s)]
*  He's back. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=501.36s)]
*  Low-energy Joe. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=503.36s)]
*  Anyway, sleepy Joe. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=505.36s)]
*  At one point, Joe actually referred to African Americans, well, using this term. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=507.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=509.36s)]
*  And I had never seen, I had never seen hardly any black people scranton at the time. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=511.36s)]
*  And I was only going in fourth grade. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=517.36s)]
*  And I remember seeing the kids going by at the time called colored kids and a bus going by. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=519.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=525.44s)]
*  The Democratic Party is not in a good place. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=525.76s)]
*  That's the same guy, by the way, that partnered with the former Klansmen. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=527.76s)]
*  For the very purpose of stopping the integration of public schools and busing, Kamala Harris, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=531.28s)]
*  even one time, called them out on it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=537.36s)]
*  But for some reason, they're totally opposed to any new leadership. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=539.28s)]
*  For example, a recent poll showing our friend Stephen A. Smith will join us in a second, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  with little chance of winning a Democratic primary in 2028. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=547.2s)]
*  I am far more suspicious of this poll than probably most people. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=551.52s)]
*  But the message I will tell you is clear. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  If you don't tell that radical left-wing hardcore-line Democrats, in the end, they will [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=558.08s)]
*  try to utterly destroy anybody if they jump into this race. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=563.0400000000001s)]
*  They will be the people that decide who their candidates are going to be. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=567.52s)]
*  And Stephen A. Smith, over the weekend, said that he has no choice but to have to leave [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=570.96s)]
*  open the door and consider a possible run. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=579.36s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren was just on with you. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=581.36s)]
*  You're going to have a multitude of Democratic representatives on with you. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=583.12s)]
*  They talk and they talk and they talk, but what can they do? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  They position themselves to do absolutely nothing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=589.44s)]
*  They talked about everything from woke culture to cancer culture to abortion rights and all [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  of this other stuff, but that wasn't going to win the election. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=595.6s)]
*  And that's what we have to look at. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=598.64s)]
*  What is it going to take to get the job done? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  That's why somebody who's a sports analyst for crying out loud is in the daggone polls. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  Are you really thinking about running for president? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=607.52s)]
*  Is this something you think— [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=609.36s)]
*  Listen, I have no choice because I've had elected officials, and I'm not going to give [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  their names, elected officials coming up to me. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=616.16s)]
*  I've had folks who are pundits come up to me. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  I've had folks that got a lot of money, billionaires and others, that have talked to me about exploratory [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=621.2s)]
*  committees and things of that nature. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=627.12s)]
*  I'm not a politician. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=628.4s)]
*  I've never had a desire to be a politician. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=629.44s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFqRsOANDeA&t=640.48s)]
