# Kristi Noem breaks down self-deportation: 'SAFER OPTION'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo)
*  Anyway, here with reaction Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary, great to have you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=3.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=5.8s)]
*  Let's talk about this new idea, this new program. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=6.8s)]
*  I had actually thought of it way back on my own. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Why don't we give them a way to self-deport, and then they might one day have a chance [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=12.24s)]
*  to come back, and you decided to sweeten the pot a little bit, but the amount of savings [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=16.0s)]
*  will be massive. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=20.64s)]
*  Tell us about the whole program and the savings. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=21.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=24.76s)]
*  These illegal aliens that are in our country have the opportunity to go on the CBP Home [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=26.56s)]
*  app, and we will facilitate them finding their way back to their countries. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=30.72s)]
*  We will pay for their plane ticket. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=36.08s)]
*  When they get there, we will verify they are who they said they are and that they are in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=38.0s)]
*  fact back home, and then they will be paid $1,000 as an incentive to go there and to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=41.96s)]
*  be able to help facilitate their housing or their clothing or their food for the period [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=47.96s)]
*  of time that they're back in their country until they can get themselves settled. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=52.76s)]
*  Listen, Sean, that's really what this whole situation is about. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=56.36s)]
*  We spend about $17,000 arresting, detaining and deporting an illegal alien right now today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=59.48s)]
*  If we have the opportunity to purchase a plane ticket and send someone home with a stipend [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=65.52s)]
*  like this, it saves us thousands and thousands of dollars, and it also is a much safer situation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=69.88s)]
*  for officers and for those in communities, and it gives that illegal an opportunity to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=74.88s)]
*  come back to the United States of America. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=80.16s)]
*  If they wait until we arrest them and deport them, they don't ever get the chance to come [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=82.8s)]
*  back to the United States. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=87.08s)]
*  They don't ever get a chance at the American Dream. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=88.08s)]
*  So those individuals that are here illegally need to realize this is their opportunity [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=90.16s)]
*  to do things the right way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=94.6s)]
*  I don't think people fully grasp or understand the costs associated with illegal immigration. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Texas just started keeping records on health care alone. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=102.8s)]
*  They are spending tens and tens of billions of dollars. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=105.6s)]
*  The state of California, hundreds of billions of dollars over the years, health care for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=108.4s)]
*  illegal immigrants. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=113.72s)]
*  I don't know why the taxpayers seem to be willing to put up with it, but it's also [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=115.44s)]
*  impacting the educational system, the criminal justice system. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=119.0s)]
*  It's putting ICE agents at risk, and we have to pay to hire these agents to track them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=122.56s)]
*  down, find them and then deport them and then put them through a legal system. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  So I mean, do you have any expectations? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=132.28s)]
*  How many people will be signing up for this? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=135.12s)]
*  I expect that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people would be able to take [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  advantage of this program. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=143.64s)]
*  And listen, the Biden administration perverted every single government program there is in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  order to facilitate the invasion that happened over our border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=150.72s)]
*  They gave them free housing, free food, free child care. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=154.06s)]
*  They gave them free medical care. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=157.2s)]
*  They treated them better than they treated American citizens. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=159.16s)]
*  And they jeopardized our community's safety by allowing these folks that are dangerous, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=162.16s)]
*  criminals into our communities. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=167.48s)]
*  And Sean, every day they're here, they're getting more and more dangerous. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=168.88s)]
*  They're recruiting more members. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=172.6s)]
*  They're getting stronger. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=174.04s)]
*  They're getting more set into their ways and facilitating more of this violent activity. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=175.48s)]
*  I just wish CNN would spend a little bit of time talking to Laken Riley's mother. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  I wonder when the last time is that they did an interview with those individuals, with [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=185.92s)]
*  Jocelyn's parents. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=189.64s)]
*  So when's the last time that, you know, they actually interviewed a victim? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=190.8s)]
*  And that's another thing that the Biden administration did, is they actually shut down the one office [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=195.04s)]
*  within ICE, within the federal government that was there to support victims of illegal [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=199.64s)]
*  criminal activity, the Voices office. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=203.96s)]
*  We just reopened that so that these families, these angel moms, can have a resource to really [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=206.4s)]
*  help them get some comfort, get some information on the crimes that perpetuated against their [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=211.62s)]
*  families. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=216.16s)]
*  It really is a shame what the Biden administration did to destroy America. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=217.16s)]
*  Let me get your reaction, Tom Homan referring, Congresswoman AOC, to the Justice Department. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  She had a webinar, Know Your Rights, and as part of it recommended that illegal immigrants [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=230.2s)]
*  ask for warrants, deploy phones, to record ICE searches, tips on how to differentiate [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=236.42s)]
*  between ICE people and others. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=243.04s)]
*  Is this what you see, and I'm sure you've looked at it, is this aiding and abetting [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  in your view? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=251.76s)]
*  I think the Department of Justice absolutely should look into this situation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=253.76s)]
*  We've seen not just those that serve in public office be willing to break the law, to facilitate [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=258.12s)]
*  the invasion that has happened and allow criminals to stay here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=264.04s)]
*  We've also seen judges take radical action to help protect these criminals. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=267.16s)]
*  It's time that we stand for what's right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=272.48s)]
*  The American people are sick of these people abusing our system to try to promote an agenda. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=274.72s)]
*  And remember, the Democrats are using fear to control people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  They're out there motivating people by fear and they're standing alongside known terrorists [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=284.44s)]
*  in order to endanger our future. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=288.92s)]
*  So I think it's entirely appropriate that the Department of Justice look into these situations. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=291.0s)]
*  All right, Secretary Noem, great job. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=296.12s)]
*  I think the biggest success in the first hundred days, clearly without a doubt, has been the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=297.76s)]
*  border and a lot more success to come. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mmXS1hICo&t=301.88s)]
