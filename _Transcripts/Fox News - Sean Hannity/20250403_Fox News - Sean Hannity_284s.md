# Newt Gingrich: This was just plain weird
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w)
*  Joining us now with more former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, my dear friend, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaker Newk Gingrich, sir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=4.88s)]
*  You keep talking about the party of crazy versus the party of common sense. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=7.38s)]
*  The party of common sense has the heavy lift. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=12.0s)]
*  They've got to get their budget passed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=14.92s)]
*  It looks like it's going to be one big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=17.04s)]
*  The reconciliation rules in the Senate are hard, but Lindsey Graham, who will be on the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=20.76s)]
*  show tomorrow, believes as budget chair he can bypass the parliamentarian. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=25.8s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=30.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, if he can get the votes, he can, sure. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  You have what in a sense directed scoring, and they could do that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=37.0s)]
*  There'll probably be a parliamentary move by the Democrats, but if they can get 50 Republicans [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=41.24s)]
*  plus the vice president to vote with Lindsey, then of course they could do it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  What's fascinating to me is, you know, I've watched Cory Booker for years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=50.92s)]
*  He used to be a relatively pleasant, almost moderate liberal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=53.72s)]
*  He was a reformer back in Newark. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=58.76s)]
*  The performance this week is just plain weird. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=61.44s)]
*  If you look at his eyes towards the end, I mean, you're dealing with a guy who is living [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=64.96s)]
*  in an alternative universe, and that's what's happening to their party. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=69.76s)]
*  They're really increasingly split. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=74.84s)]
*  I think you'll see a civil war breakout between the religious left, who believe in everything [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=76.2s)]
*  you talked about earlier with Mark Wayne Mullins, and the survivalists who understand, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=81.92s)]
*  you know, you can't run on 12, 15, 20 percent issues and survive. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And I fully expect to see a deep split in the Democratic party in the next year or year [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=93.12s)]
*  and a half. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=98.88s)]
*  And remember, yesterday in Florida, Democrats outspent Republicans eight to one in a congressional [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=99.88s)]
*  seat and lost. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=106.04s)]
*  They outspent Republicans in the other congressional seat four to one and lost. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=107.68s)]
*  If I were the Democrats, those numbers would really sober me a lot. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=113.64s)]
*  Well, they talk about the Wisconsin Supreme Court case, but they had the more conservative [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=116.68s)]
*  justice that was running or would be justice, you know, on record saying that he did not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=122.84s)]
*  support exceptions and wanted to uphold the law, earlier law in Wisconsin that doesn't [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  have exceptions for rape incest of the mother's life. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=135.44000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't believe you can wing and win in a swing state with that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  What's your reaction to the president and today and reciprocal terrorists? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=142.44000000000003s)]
*  To me as a free and fair trader, it's got to be free and it's got to be fair. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=146.08s)]
*  It's anything but fair. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=150.9s)]
*  America has been getting ripped off and I think ultimately a lot of these countries [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=152.44000000000003s)]
*  will come begging, knocking on Donald Trump's door, begging for a deal. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, the fact is if you watch the president today and what I thought was historically [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=161.55999999999997s)]
*  one of his more important performances, he laid out this is what they do to us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=166.6s)]
*  This is how they block us in Australia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  We can't sell beef. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=173.0s)]
*  This is how they block us in Japan and South Carolina, I mean South Korea. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=174.0s)]
*  We can't sell rice. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  This is how Japan blocks us from selling cars. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=179.22s)]
*  You go down the list and you say, yeah, it makes perfect sense that the United States [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=181.6s)]
*  has the right to protect the largest market in the world from being ripped off. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  And you're exactly right. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  People are going to show up and they're going to start saying, okay, if I eliminate this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=192.82s)]
*  and you get to come and sell stuff, can we work out a better deal? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=197.08s)]
*  And that's exactly what Trump wants. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=200.96s)]
*  But he also has a deep instinct here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=202.84s)]
*  One, build factories in America for national security reasons and for quality of life and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  income reasons. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=211.52s)]
*  Make sure that you actually start shifting the tax burden back onto tariffs. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=213.36s)]
*  Prior to 1913, when they passed the income tax, tariffs were the primary source of revenue [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=218.8s)]
*  for the United States for its entire first 150 years. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  And they raised plenty of money. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=228.24s)]
*  Jefferson said proudly in his second inaugural, there was not a single internal revenue agent [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=230.12s)]
*  because all their money came from tariffs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=235.52s)]
*  So Trump is actually returning us to a very successful American model that created the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=237.72s)]
*  biggest industrial society in the world. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=243.92s)]
*  And by the way, Smoot Hawley was passed after the crash in 1929, nine months later. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=246.84s)]
*  But why let history and truth get in the way of the good story? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=254.64s)]
*  Well Milton Friedman proved conclusively that it was the monetary policy of the Federal [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=259.24s)]
*  Reserve that caused the depression to get so deep and so long and had nothing to do [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=263.48s)]
*  with tariff policy. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=267.88s)]
*  All right, Mr. Speaker, always good to see you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utfybjdD08w&t=268.88s)]
