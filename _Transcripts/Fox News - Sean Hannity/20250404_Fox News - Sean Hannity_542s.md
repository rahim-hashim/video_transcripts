# Sean Hannity: America is finally playing to win
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight another big show coming up huge economic numbers as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=0.0s)]
*  results pour in from President Trump and his reciprocal tariffs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=7.76s)]
*  A new poll showing that Chuck Schumer is about to be the throne by AOC. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=12.52s)]
*  I've been telling you, the real leader of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=16.76s)]
*  Also, Dr. Oz just confirmed will be here for his first TV interview since joining the Trump [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=19.96s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=25.64s)]
*  And we are going to show you by far the best political pranks from the creator of the Note [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=27.12s)]
*  Boys, Kyle Forgard. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=33.28s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=36.2s)]
*  You see this woman right here? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Take a look at her. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=38.82s)]
*  She's voicing her support for illegal immigration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=39.92s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=43.92s)]
*  I promise you, you will laugh so hard you'll have tears in your eyes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=45.0s)]
*  Anyway, Kyle will give us his thoughts on why President Trump continues to surge in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=48.52s)]
*  popularity among young Americans. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=53.34s)]
*  Donald Trump went on their podcast. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=56.8s)]
*  I was on it yesterday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=58.4s)]
*  Anyway, last but certainly not least, the great Jimmy Fallon will join us to wrap up [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=59.72s)]
*  this week's other news, including a fresh word salad from Kamala Harris, who has reemerged [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=63.36s)]
*  to root against Donald Trump and cheer for economic suffering for hardworking men and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  women. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=74.64s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=75.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=76.64s)]
*  We are seeing organizations stay quiet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=77.64s)]
*  We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=81.72s)]
*  And these are the things that we are witnessing each day in these last few months in our country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=96.24s)]
*  And it understandably creates a great sense of fear. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=105.76s)]
*  Because, you know, there were many things that we knew would happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  Many things. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=116.76s)]
*  I'm not here, so I told you so. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=118.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=122.0s)]
*  Could you imagine four years of that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  I want to take a moment and thank every American that voted for Donald Trump because you prevented [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=126.12s)]
*  this country from having four years of that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=131.46s)]
*  Now, let's be very clear. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=134.44s)]
*  After a really humiliating loss for her, Kamala Harris is actively rooting, what, for American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=135.84s)]
*  suffering? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=141.32s)]
*  She doesn't want Donald Trump to succeed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=142.32s)]
*  She doesn't want Americans to have a better life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=144.0s)]
*  I thought Democrats cared about working men and women. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=145.84s)]
*  Just talk. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=148.74s)]
*  You know, she just wants to feel better about herself. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=149.74s)]
*  And she's not the only one. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=152.56s)]
*  Barack Hussein Obama, back of the news, chiming in and calling for collective sacrifice. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Sounds like Jimmy Carter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=159.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=161.4s)]
*  It has been easy during most of our lifetimes to say you are a progressive or say you are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=162.88s)]
*  for social justice or say you're for free speech and not have to pay a price for it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=173.76s)]
*  And now we're at one of those moments where, you know what, it's not enough just to say [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=183.28s)]
*  you're for something. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=189.56s)]
*  You may actually have to do something and possibly sacrifice a little bit. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=192.08s)]
*  Excuse me, the people that want to silence and the people that want to cancel and the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  people that boycott and the people that are woke and the word police, that would be his [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  party. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  In other words, but if you listen to Obama, he too is rooting for Americans to suffer [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  so that he can finally get Trump once and for all. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=211.72000000000003s)]
*  Of course, Obama won't experience any suffering himself. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  He has as many multiple mansions all across the country in places like beautiful Matha's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=218.12s)]
*  Vineyard. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=223.4s)]
*  He gets to hobnob with other, with arrogant, rich and famous jackasses like his buddy and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=224.4s)]
*  loser, Jackass George Clooney. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=230.52s)]
*  And we have a message for him later in the show. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  Now for Obama, one big political game, doesn't really care about the quality of your life, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=235.28s)]
*  the suffering you had the last four years. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=240.96s)]
*  He remains silent about the lies on immigration, the biggest national security threat in our [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=243.76s)]
*  lifetime. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And you know, he just wants to say anything to trash Donald Trump because not only did [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=249.76s)]
*  Kamala lose, he stood up for Kamala and Kamala lost. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=254.24s)]
*  For example, here's what he said about Trump's reciprocal tariffs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=257.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=261.56s)]
*  I don't think what we just witnessed in terms of economic policy and tariffs is going to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=262.56s)]
*  be good for America. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=267.28s)]
*  But let's go back a few years ago. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=269.04s)]
*  He said the complete opposite and we've got the tape. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=271.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=274.24s)]
*  It's also proper for advanced economies like the United States to insist on reciprocity [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=301.48s)]
*  from nations like China that are no longer solely poor countries to make sure that they're [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  providing access to their markets and that they stop taking intellectual property and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  hacking our servers. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=319.12s)]
*  Oh, top Democrats have always been championing reciprocal tariffs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=322.12s)]
*  Oh, that is until this Tuesday, Liberation Day, when Donald Trump announced his plan [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=328.36s)]
*  to actually put it into action. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=333.68s)]
*  The exact same tariffs that they are on record supporting. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=336.24s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=341.36s)]
*  That the average U.S. MFM tariff on Chinese goods coming into the United States is 2 percent. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=343.36s)]
*  Whereas the average Chinese MFM tariff on U.S. goods going into China is 35 percent. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=349.44s)]
*  Is that reciprocal? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  What they have said is that we need to not worry about manufacturing in America because [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=358.12s)]
*  what we should establish is a policy of unfettered free trade. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=368.12s)]
*  We don't need tariffs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=373.12s)]
*  What we need is to allow corporate America the freedom, the freedom to throw American [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=374.76s)]
*  workers out on the street. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=380.12s)]
*  So I have been one of the chief critics of status quo on trade. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=382.68s)]
*  Americans, and I share this, resent all those academics who anytime you try to do anything [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  with China, they say protectionist, trade war. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=394.68s)]
*  The bottom line is simple. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  China's eating our lunch. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=400.6s)]
*  China's rapacious. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=402.72s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=403.72s)]
*  You know what tape can do? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=404.72s)]
*  Just remind you what hypocrites, what liars they are. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=407.8s)]
*  Now instead of working together with President Trump on a policy they've openly advocated [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=410.52s)]
*  for and enacting a trade policy they've always supported, Democrats, they are fomenting panic [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  and hysteria as per usual. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=422.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, this hand-wringing, it will be short-lived. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=424.52s)]
*  According to the White House, Vietnam, they're already begging, they're offering to eliminate [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  tariffs on the U.S. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  Cambodia, also desperate for a deal with Donald Trump with reports that the country is willing [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=433.0s)]
*  to slash their tariffs from 35% to 5%. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=438.72s)]
*  Reciprocal. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=442.68s)]
*  They'll benefit, we'll benefit. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=443.68s)]
*  That's the beauty of it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=445.8s)]
*  They have the choice, free and fair trade or reciprocal tariffs. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=446.8s)]
*  Up to them. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  Here at home, both General Motors, Nissan, they're working fast to expand their manufacturing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=451.64000000000004s)]
*  plants right here in the USA. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=455.94s)]
*  High-paying career jobs. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  There are dozens of other countries now working behind the scenes to lower their own tariffs [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=459.94s)]
*  and finally create a level playing field with the United States that they have been abusing [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=466.36s)]
*  and taking advantage of because we've had politicians that let them do it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  Most importantly, as FoxNews.com, an opinion piece points out, quote, liberation day is [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=475.64000000000004s)]
*  about investment, not in financial derivatives or foreign product change, but in our own [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=481.24s)]
*  people to create jobs for them. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=487.76000000000005s)]
*  Now, this is about putting America and American jobs first. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=490.16s)]
*  That has been Donald Trump's sole mission from day one. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q1VtIWijHA&t=494.84000000000003s)]
