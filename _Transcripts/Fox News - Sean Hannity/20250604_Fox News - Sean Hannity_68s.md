**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y)
*  There is more coming on the Epstein files listen, I know this is a hot potato for folks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I totally understand my comments were clear. I'm not paid for my opinions anymore. I work for the taxpayer now [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=5.42s)]
*  I'm paid on evidence. That's it the evidence we have in our files [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=11.08s)]
*  Clearly indicates that it was in fact the suicide. We do have video. It's not the greatest video in the world [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=15.48s)]
*  I don't want to set expectations on fire [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=21.66s)]
*  However, the video does show in that specific block that he goes in made a phone call [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=23.92s)]
*  You'll see 12 hours of guards going to basically check on him come back [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=29.26s)]
*  You'll see no one really comes out in that bay in that area than him. There's no one in there [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=34.34s)]
*  When you combine that with the other evidence where we will be releasing in the coming weeks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=39.38s)]
*  We're still finalizing some of the products. I think it's pretty clear [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=44.42s)]
*  However, as I've clearly indicated in some of my tweets on my official account, you know, listen [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=48.38s)]
*  Investigations if new information services in the future on any of these cases were always open [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=55.18s)]
*  I'm just telling you is nothing there in the file at all that indicates anything other than in fact the suicide [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyKtfZ2s94Y&t=59.62s)]
