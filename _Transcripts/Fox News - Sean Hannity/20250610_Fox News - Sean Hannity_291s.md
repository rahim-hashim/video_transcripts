# 'COORDINATED INSURGENCY': Los Angeles rioters called out amid destruction
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k)
*  Well, back to Bill Mollusian in just a minute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=0.0s)]
*  But first, joining us with Reaction, former IDF head Aaron Konis with us, former FBI special [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=3.24s)]
*  agent, Fox News contributor Nicole Parker. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=9.48s)]
*  Nicole, I can't imagineâ€”we see that they have prepositioned baseball bats. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=11.96s)]
*  They were handing out earplugs and gas masks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=19.04s)]
*  They have frozen water bottles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=22.36s)]
*  They're pelting cops with that and with Molotov cocktails. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=23.96s)]
*  They're throwing fireworks at them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=26.96s)]
*  It's an untenable situation, also preventable, also predictable. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=29.68s)]
*  And then you've got handcuffs on local law enforcement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=34.36s)]
*  These guys are doing the best job they can under the circumstances. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=36.64s)]
*  President Trump saw what happened in the summer of 2020. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=40.28s)]
*  How many people would have to die? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=43.4s)]
*  How many people would have to be injured before he would then act? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=45.12s)]
*  At that point, it would be too late, wouldn't it? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=48.44s)]
*  Yeah, it would be. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  And this will not be summer of 2020, part two. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=52.64s)]
*  I guarantee you that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=55.16s)]
*  President Trump is coming in strong and he's saying this will not be tolerated. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=56.6s)]
*  And Sean, this is a very different situation than we were dealing with before. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=60.0s)]
*  I can speak for myself as a former FBI agent who was working for the FBI during that time frame. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=63.32s)]
*  You fast forward to right now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=68.72s)]
*  You've got Director Cash Patel and he's saying there is zero tolerance for this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=70.28s)]
*  You have Attorney General Pam Bondi, zero tolerance for this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=74.36s)]
*  There will be harsh consequences. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Under Christopher Wray, there was a posture of stand down, don't do anything. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=79.4s)]
*  I mean, they didn't want to charge anybody. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=85.28s)]
*  Now you've got Pam Bondi, Cash Patel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  They will be extremely aggressive. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  I do believe that this is highly orchestrated. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=90.64s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that all of that was planted there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  But again, the games are the games will be over. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  President Trump saying we're going to take charge and we're not going to have a replay of what happened in the summer of 2020. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=98.44s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=105.64s)]
*  Aaron, let's get your take on this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=107.8s)]
*  If you understand tactical strategies in situations like this, because the IDF deals with it unfortunately on a regular basis, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't see any other alternative. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=117.0s)]
*  But if local law enforcement don't have the authority, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=119.04s)]
*  they can't even ask the legal status of somebody they encounter, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=124.48s)]
*  how could they possibly use proper law enforcement technique that is necessary in this moment? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=128.72s)]
*  Well, Sean, you're absolutely right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=136.68s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=138.68s)]
*  Law enforcement is using an incredible amount of restraint. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=139.56s)]
*  These are from sources of mine on the ground, actual cops who are on the streets, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=142.36s)]
*  who have been justified in several different instances where they could have used lethal force but didn't. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=146.52s)]
*  They're under constant arrests and they're under constant threat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  But I want to speak to the bigger picture with this here from the counterterror angle. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=157.44s)]
*  This isn't a protest problem here in Los Angeles, Sean. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=162.16s)]
*  This is a counterintelligence problem. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=166.76s)]
*  And what's happening in Los Angeles isn't free speech. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  This is coordinated insurgency, which is what everybody understands and what Nicole just alluded to. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  We've got political backed money, digital organizing on platforms, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=183.6s)]
*  masked agitators who are flooding the streets right now again with the Palestine flags, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=189.2s)]
*  every other flag but the American flags, and politicians who are quietly standing behind this all. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=194.96s)]
*  You just spoke to Newsom. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=200.6s)]
*  No one's doing a thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=201.84s)]
*  Bass isn't doing a thing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=203.16s)]
*  And so this has nothing to do with immigration. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=204.84s)]
*  This is about control, Sean, control of the streets, control of the algorithm, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  and ultimately control of the country, which is what they're trying to do. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=212.6s)]
*  And this is low threat domestic intensity is what this is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=217.16s)]
*  Insurgency, this is what this looks like. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  And if this was overseas, and we saw this happening right now with U.S. troops, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=223.12s)]
*  mobs trying to overrun Marines outside of an embassy, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=227.68s)]
*  torching vehicles and trying to breach perimeters, this would be terrorism, Sean. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=232.16s)]
*  And the ones who are paying the price, law enforcement on the ground. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  And so Donald Trump was right to send in the guard to activate the Marines. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=242.04s)]
*  And now it's time to start following the money and prosecuting. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=247.68s)]
*  And that's where I come out with all this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=252.68s)]
*  It's all nonsense, and there's a lot behind it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=254.52s)]
*  You know, when you think of Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=258.04s)]
*  and you think back to the Pacific Palisades and the fires, by the way, predictable fires, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=261.04s)]
*  Santa Ana winds that are predictable also in the area, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=265.72s)]
*  and we had fire hydrants that had no water, and we had reservoirs that had no water. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=269.32s)]
*  And their answer was, oh, you have to ask the local officials. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=274.44s)]
*  That's not my problem. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=276.76s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OelvpcM5X5k&t=278.79999999999995s)]
