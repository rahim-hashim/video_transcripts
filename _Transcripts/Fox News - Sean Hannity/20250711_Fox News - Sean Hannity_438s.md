# Will Comey, Brennan pay the price? Mark Meadows weighs in
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY)
*  So, while China was buying U.S. farmland, deep state bureaucrats were busy pushing the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia collusion hoax. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And finally, we may get some answers. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=8.52s)]
*  According to the DOJ sources, former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=10.92s)]
*  are now each facing criminal investigations over their roles in the Russia hoax. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=17.36s)]
*  But John Brennan is claiming he's, quote, clueless as to why he's under investigation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=23.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=28.8s)]
*  The people who actually worked this, both in terms of trying to collect intelligence [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=29.88s)]
*  prior to the election and then the ones who put together the intelligence community assessment, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=34.04s)]
*  they really, I think, showed the best of what the intelligence community and what CIA is [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=37.8s)]
*  made of. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=41.68s)]
*  So, again, I am clueless about what it is exactly that they may be investigating before. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=42.68s)]
*  And as always, Senator John Kennedy had the perfect response. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=49.84s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=53.28s)]
*  These two are just especially bad. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=54.8s)]
*  And they were so political. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  They're just political hacks who tried to pretend that they had the American people's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=60.44s)]
*  best interests at heart. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=65.28s)]
*  And they don't. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=67.56s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Miranda Devine and former White House Chief of Staff [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  Mark Meadows. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=75.96s)]
*  Of course, John Brennan might not be so clueless as to why he's under investigation if he [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=77.0s)]
*  actually read some of the stories by you, Miranda. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  It is remarkable to sit here and look back over the past eight years, and both of you, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=84.0s)]
*  you've covered it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=91.0s)]
*  Mark, you lived through it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=92.0s)]
*  But the biggest political scandal that we have lived through in our lifetimes was the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=94.32s)]
*  idea that you had the Obama administration launching the U.S. intelligence services against [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=100.72s)]
*  the political enemy of the party that was in power in the White House and used it to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  try to destroy their political opponent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=112.24s)]
*  And they largely in a lot of ways got away with a whole lot of it, Miranda. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=116.56s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't just about doing down a political opponent before an election. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=123.72s)]
*  It was about sabotaging President Trump's first presidency before he even got his feet [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=129.16s)]
*  under the resolute desk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=135.18s)]
*  It was successful because this cooked up assessment that included the discredited, as they all [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=138.32s)]
*  knew at the time, Steele dossier, preposterous document, was dressed up as if it was a real [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=147.12s)]
*  intelligence community assessment driven, now we know, entirely by John Brennan, hand-picked [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  analysts and excluding the other 13 of the 17 then 17 intelligence agencies and sidelining [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=160.24s)]
*  the National Intelligence Council, which normally oversees these assessments. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  So it was a bogus document from the start. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=175.84s)]
*  And John Ratcliffe has now declassified and released this review, which includes emails [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=178.68s)]
*  from John Brennan in which he's pushing back against the analysts, the career professionals [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=186.04s)]
*  in the organization who said, no, do not include the Steele dossier. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=192.48s)]
*  You'll discredit the whole thing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  And he said, my bottom line is I want it included. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=198.88s)]
*  And now you see John Brennan complaining about leaks and that really is rich coming from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=202.56s)]
*  him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Mark, Miranda's exactly right about that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  So much of this effort was designed to undermine that first term. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  You saw all of it first from the House, your perch in the House, and then also as chief [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=219.22s)]
*  of staff. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=223.76s)]
*  How did those deep state efforts undermine Trump's first term? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=225.04s)]
*  Well, it was a reoccurring theme over and over again, Charlie. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=230.6s)]
*  And Miranda's right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=234.56s)]
*  It was really rich to hear them complain about leaks coming out of DOJ. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=235.56s)]
*  And the entire DOJ, FBI was a leak operation designed to continue this information Russian [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=241.6s)]
*  hoax from the from the get go. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=252.16s)]
*  And listen, here's here's what we do know is President Trump was treated very differently [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=254.88s)]
*  than candidate Hillary Clinton. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=261.04s)]
*  We've known that for a long time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  You've covered it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=265.6s)]
*  Miranda's written about it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=266.6s)]
*  Obviously, it's been part of a number of congressional hearings. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=268.24s)]
*  But here's also the interesting thing today is, is the testimony given on Capitol Hill [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=272.88000000000005s)]
*  doesn't seem to jive with some of the emails that have now been declassified and released. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=279.56s)]
*  And yet we know from the intelligence assessment that Christopher Steele and this dossier not [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  only had huge holes in it, but it had credibility problems from the get go. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=295.32s)]
*  And yet there was a desire to continue that narrative that affected the Trump administration [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=299.76s)]
*  throughout the four years of his first term. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=306.84s)]
*  Miranda, do you think that Jim Comey and John Brennan will ever actually pay a price for [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=310.4s)]
*  this? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I have more confidence now than I previously did. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=317.52s)]
*  John Ratcliffe, the CIA, has made this referral. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  They were compelled to do so because I believe it may be on allegations of perjury, because [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=329.2s)]
*  as Mark just said, there are very differing statements that came out of thinking particularly [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=338.16s)]
*  of Brennan about the Steele dossier, which he said he knew nothing about its inclusion [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=345.16s)]
*  in that assessment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  No, you know, of course it wasn't included. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  It was not just an annex. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=353.2s)]
*  It was included in the main body of the assessment. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=355.52s)]
*  It coloured the entire assessment. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=359.08s)]
*  And John Brennan lied about that continually. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=361.92s)]
*  He lied about it in testimony to Congress. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=365.64s)]
*  But he also gave testimony within the last five years, which is important because that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=368.84s)]
*  means it's within the statute of limitations, to both the Durham investigation and also [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  to James Comey's Biden corruption investigation. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  So I believe the CIA would not have referred this to the FBI if they didn't have evidence [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=384.6s)]
*  that some of that testimony behind closed doors did not jibe with the actual words of [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  John Brennan in those emails. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=398.88s)]
*  Right. Mark, real quick, do you think that they'll pay a price? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, I'm doubtful. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=405.32s)]
*  Obviously, we've seen this over and over again with the Durham investigation in a number [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=407.16s)]
*  of things. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=412.6s)]
*  But I'm just doubtful that we'll have hopefully what we'll see is changing where this never [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=414.0s)]
*  happens again to any sitting president or candidate. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=419.16s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=422.6s)]
*  Miranda Devon, Mark Meadows, thank you both for coming on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCtsZzMlAY&t=423.6s)]
