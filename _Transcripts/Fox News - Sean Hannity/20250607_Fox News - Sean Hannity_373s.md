# Stephen Miller: These are some of the most 'heinous crimes' I've ever seen
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g)
*  reaction. Deputy White House Chief of Staff for Policy Homeland Security Advisor Stephen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=0.0s)]
*  Miller. Look, we're going to be dealing with this for decades to come. It doesn't take, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=5.2s)]
*  it doesn't remove every known terrorist that we don't know where they are in the country that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=9.36s)]
*  they allowed in, or the cartel members, or the gang members, or the murderers, or the rapists, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=14.16s)]
*  or the other violent criminals, or the drug dealers. But we stopped the influx of illegals. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Now we're in the process of trying to find all the people that Biden let in and get rid of them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=26.72s)]
*  That's a Herculean task. Yes, it's a mammoth task. As President Trump has said, Biden flooded this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  country with millions and millions of illegal aliens, many of them rapists, murderers, gang [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=41.12s)]
*  members, terrorists, human smugglers, child traffickers, and every kind of criminal and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=45.68s)]
*  thug that you can imagine on planet Earth. But let's begin by celebrating the incredible news [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=50.96s)]
*  that President Trump, as you mentioned, Sean, has achieved the most secure border with the lowest [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=56.48s)]
*  level of illegal crossings in U.S. history. Sean, I've been studying and following and working on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=61.36s)]
*  this issue for a long time. There is no nation anywhere on planet Earth that has achieved such [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=66.16s)]
*  a rapid success on its border in any time period. As President Trump has achieved here in the United [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=72.08s)]
*  States, going nearly overnight from an open border to a sealed border surely ranks as one of the great [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  achievements in the history of domestic policy and national security. Now, you mentioned another [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=84.4s)]
*  breaking news story tonight, Sean. The Department of Justice has indicted the illegal alien terrorist [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=90.0s)]
*  from Maryland, the so-called Maryland man, who is actually a foreign terrorist from El Salvador, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=99.44000000000001s)]
*  to make him face justice for his monstrous crimes against humanity. Another huge win for the Trump [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  administration. Thanks to weeks of investigative work, this illegal alien monster is going to be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=110.8s)]
*  held accountable for his terrible crimes against women and children. And then guess what, Sean? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=118.96s)]
*  After he does hard time in an American jail, guess where he's going? Right back to El Salvador. What [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  do Democrats have to say about this now? They celebrated this guy. They worshiped this guy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=131.84s)]
*  They treated him as a hero. Now he's been indicted by a grand jury for committing some of the most [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=137.27999999999997s)]
*  heinous crimes I've ever read about. He's going to do hard time in our jails, and then he's going [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=143.2s)]
*  back home where he belongs to El Salvador. Here's my worry. In spite of everything that you have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  accomplished and you are right in expressing, we've never been able to secure a border this fast. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  There's never been a more preventable national security disaster like this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  But in spite of all of these great efforts in record time, you, the president, vice president, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=166.08s)]
*  Kristi Noem, Tom Homan, everybody involved here, I don't know how you find every terrorist. I was [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=171.84s)]
*  asking Dan Bongino about it this week. How do you possibly find people that we don't even know are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  in this country, the gotaways that got in? We don't know where they came from. 200 countries? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=187.36s)]
*  I've got to imagine that my prediction, it's a matter of when, not if, and is going to turn [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=193.52s)]
*  out to be right. I mean, I would argue last weekend in Boulder was a terrorist attack. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=200.24s)]
*  And I think that, you know, we have to, we have a million men out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  It was a terrorist attack from a Biden illegal. It was a terrorist attack from a Biden illegal [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=208.8s)]
*  that was given a work permit by Joe Biden. A million FBI man hours spent on the border, Stephen? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=213.28s)]
*  So the, you're right. This is the thing that gives me the greatest concern about the future [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=222.48s)]
*  of this country is the millions of unvetted, unchecked, just unknown foreign nationals who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=230.48s)]
*  have been deposited into this country. Not to mention the millions more of visa overstays [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=239.84s)]
*  embedded into all of our communities, some operating at the direction and control of foreign [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  governments, foreign enemies, foreign terrorist organizations, not to mention the cartels, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=250.4s)]
*  which have spread so much bloodshed across this hemisphere that do business with some of our worst [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=255.84s)]
*  adversaries. But it's why Sean, and I'll say this now, it's why it's so important to pass the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=260.64s)]
*  president's big, beautiful bill. Is that legislation hires 10,000 new ICE agents to go and find these [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=265.2s)]
*  killers and terrorists. It funds the detention beds we need to keep these people off our streets. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  It funds the planes we need to fly them back home. It also funds the creation of Homeland Security [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=277.36s)]
*  task forces with FBI, ATF, ICE, Homeland Security Investigations, and others to prioritize the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=284.56s)]
*  disruption and dismantlement of foreign terrorist organizations in our cities. And of course, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=292.16s)]
*  it funds the entire phase two of the wall project across the entire southern border. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=296.72s)]
*  That funding and the authorities in this legislation, Sean, are the best chance that we [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  have of giving our president, our commander in chief, our leader, the tools that he needs [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=307.36s)]
*  to keep America safe. By the way, you're right. The bill has to be passed. Lindsey Graham on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=313.68s)]
*  my radio show earlier today was very clear. We're not going to stop here. We're going to go back. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=320.0s)]
*  We're going to look for all the savings we can possibly find. And he said he wants to do not one, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=325.6s)]
*  but two more reconciliation bills as fast as possible, find money for savings. But we need [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=330.88s)]
*  this money upfront. It is imperative for all of the things that you mentioned, securing the border, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=338.0s)]
*  energy dominance, the next generation of weaponry, and of course, tax cuts for the American people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=343.2s)]
*  Steve, yeah, Stephen Miller, very ambitious agenda. And we got to fight to keep the country safe. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=349.12s)]
*  Stephen Miller, appreciate it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  Enact the promises President Trump campaigned on and we will. Thank you, Sean. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mD5YveKJ-g&t=356.64000000000004s)]
