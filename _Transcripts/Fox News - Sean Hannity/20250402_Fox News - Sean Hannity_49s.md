# 'SPARTACUS': Hannity rips Sen. Booker over his "performative" marathon Senate speech #news #shorts
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M)
*  Cory Booker decided to speak non-stop on the Senate floor for 24 hours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=0.0s)]
*  No food, no bathroom breaks, no silence. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=5.0s)]
*  Just Cory Booker's performative art at a podium, talking for hours, saying nothing worthwhile. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=8.0s)]
*  And of course, it's not a filibuster. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=16.0s)]
*  He's not officially blocking any bill, but he did go on and on and on, all about his hatred, of all things. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=18.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, what a shock. Take a look. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=25.0s)]
*  I confess that I've been inadequate to the moment. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=27.0s)]
*  I confess that the Democratic Party has made terrible mistakes that have given lane to this demagogue. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=30.0s)]
*  Nobody was watching. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=36.0s)]
*  We haven't seen this much bravery from Cory Booker since he referred to himself as Spartacus. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=38.0s)]
*  That was during the Kavanaugh witch hunt. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNLaxaPcE3M&t=43.0s)]
