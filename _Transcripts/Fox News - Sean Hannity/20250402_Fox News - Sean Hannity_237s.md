# Hunter Biden’s ‘fall guy’ speaks out after Trump commutes his sentence
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU)
*  Now, in addition to napping, he was busy looking out for himself and his family. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=0.0s)]
*  On Friday, President Trump granted clemency to the so-called Fall Guy for some of Hunter [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=4.72s)]
*  Biden's alleged crimes. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=9.98s)]
*  Now, Jason Galanis was Hunter's former business partner and actually testified as part of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=11.52s)]
*  the House GOP impeachment inquiry against then-President Joe Biden. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=17.12s)]
*  Tonight, Jason Galanis joins us with more. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=21.56s)]
*  Well, first, I'm glad everything worked out for you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=24.04s)]
*  For one, your testimony before James Comer's committee, the House Oversight Committee, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=26.6s)]
*  on influence peddling, what did you learn about the Biden family? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=33.28s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, I'm delighted to be here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=39.88s)]
*  And I had the opportunity to thank the president for his leadership. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=40.88s)]
*  He's a once-in-a-hundred-year-or-more president, and he's taken it to the DOJ and the weaponization. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=44.8s)]
*  And I'm delighted to be able to be here and thank him and thank Chairman Jordan, Chairman [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=53.28s)]
*  Comer for rooting out and giving him the proof of what's come to light about the Biden crime [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=58.32s)]
*  family. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  So I think that there's some parallels of intersection in my direct experience with [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=64.76s)]
*  the Biden family and then my prosecution that sort of runs parallel, directly parallel, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=70.0s)]
*  to what happened with Russia, Russia, Russia to the president and to the impeachment hoax. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=75.04s)]
*  And those things run right straight through the New York prosecutor's office and then [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=83.4s)]
*  even into your past segment, into some of the Democratic courts controlled in New York. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=87.68s)]
*  And I think that big law is on notice and the president is on to them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  So be warned, the president's on to them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=98.92s)]
*  And I've never seen a lawyer smarter than the President Trump, who knows the law better [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=101.14s)]
*  than any lawyer. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=106.16s)]
*  I'm sure you would agree with that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=107.16s)]
*  Let me ask you, you were sentenced to 189 months in prison. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=110.36s)]
*  The Biden family got preemptive pardons. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=113.32s)]
*  How much money do you believe, based on your understanding of their business practices, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=115.97999999999999s)]
*  do you believe the Biden family made and how much of it do you believe was related to influence [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=122.16s)]
*  peddling? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=128.28s)]
*  100% of it was influence peddling. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=129.28s)]
*  I saw it firsthand. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=131.68s)]
*  It was part of our game plan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=133.66s)]
*  And I say our game plan because at some point my legitimate businesses became illegitimate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  by aligning with Hunter Biden. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=140.2s)]
*  And the alignment included the Biden lift or Biden brand. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=142.76s)]
*  And that was selling the Biden name. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=148.22s)]
*  By definition, I think that's influence peddling and it resulted in tens of millions of dollars [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=151.56s)]
*  with the intent to be many, many times more than that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=155.88s)]
*  Was Joe Biden aware of all of it? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=160.04s)]
*  I can tell you firsthand he was. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=164.0s)]
*  He was on at least two phone calls, business phone calls that I was directly a participant in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=165.54s)]
*  And when he said that he never once spoke to his son, his brother or anybody about their [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=171.68s)]
*  foreign business deals, was that a lie? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=175.72s)]
*  Sean, that's a lie. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=178.48s)]
*  That is an outright lie. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=180.28s)]
*  Documents have proven it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=182.4s)]
*  Chairman Kovner has proven it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=184.0s)]
*  Chairman Jordan has proven it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=186.04s)]
*  The corroborating evidence that I produced that Mark Paoletta, who fought tirelessly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=187.96s)]
*  for the committee for the country, produced corroborating evidence that that is a lie. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=192.72s)]
*  Quid pro glo. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  Joe was on the golf course negotiating with the Chinese Communist Party to be able to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  sit on the board and take money from the Chinese. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=202.84s)]
*  It's absolutely a lie. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=206.0s)]
*  That WhatsApp message says a lot, doesn't it? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=208.36s)]
*  And you're not getting the billion dollars, leveraging a billion dollars in Ukraine unless, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=210.72000000000003s)]
*  of course, you get rid of a prosecutor investigating Hunter. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Jason, glad everything worked out for you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=219.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Biden family was not looking out for you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=221.88s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQp48wit8rU&t=224.28s)]
