*  And I had him yesterday and taped a full interview with him on the full send podcast with Kyle [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=15.68s)]
*  You can watch it on the YouTube channel that they have Kyle great to see it. That's some of the funniest [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=21.64s)]
*  I feel like I just I feel like I just saw you yesterday [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=28.12s)]
*  You did just see me yesterday and we were drinking happy dad at 10 o'clock in the morning. It was great [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=31.2s)]
*  Ten o'clock in the morning. I'm surprised you crack one. That's big props to Sean Sean's Sean's a real beauty [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=38.44s)]
*  Listen, I'll do whatever it takes [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=44.28s)]
*  You I mean you you're looking at like 20 million, you know people watching this podcast yours and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=46.44s)]
*  The person that first made me aware of you was my own son and then my found out my daughter watches you and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=53.8s)]
*  all these young people watch you and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=60.44s)]
*  You made conservative cool among young people and it definitely my view had a big part to play in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=63.12s)]
*  President Trump's success. How did it happen? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=69.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know we always just try to stay true to ourselves and stay true to what's in our heart and our whole [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=73.68s)]
*  Crew, you know, we've just been Trump supporters [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=80.28s)]
*  So there wasn't really any strategic move or any plan in place [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Like we just supported President Trump and we wanted to use our platform to do everything we could to do what we thought was right [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=87.6s)]
*  And and you've gotten a lot of big names. You've had Stephen a you've had Dana White. You've had President Trump [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=95.0s)]
*  You were stuck with me yesterday. That doesn't count [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=101.56s)]
*  But you know now [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=104.4s)]
*  Happy dad your seltzer hard seltzer is the number three selling [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=106.64s)]
*  Seltzer behind white claw in the entire country. I mean that is a massive success [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  What made you think of that? Yeah number three, but even yeah [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=118.28s)]
*  Yes, it's the number three or number four seltzer in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=123.44s)]
*  every state in America [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=127.28s)]
*  It's doing really well. And yeah, like I told you on the podcast, you know when we were coming up [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  We were always kind of edgy and we still kind of are we're always like the outliers in the social media community [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=134.28s)]
*  Whether it be for our support with for Trump or just the jokes we make so YouTube ever never actually monetized us or paid us [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=139.0s)]
*  Like other youtubers that were making you know hundreds of thousands dollars a month because they're more brand friendly [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=146.84s)]
*  But it kind of worked out in our favor because it forced us to get smart and build businesses around our brand [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's how we started happy dad [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=158.8s)]
*  We started it three years ago with my two partners Sam and John Chihiti [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=160.4s)]
*  and Steve will do it and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just become a huge huge success. So we're very happy with it. That's our baby [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=167.4s)]
*  All right [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  How did it work out that you got the president and by the way when you are on Trump force one? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=173.32s)]
*  That means you either ate McDonald's KFC or a pizza which one? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=177.4s)]
*  We ate McDonald's and Chick-fil-a so that was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=184.12s)]
*  That's a new edition for sure but yeah, yes, it was it was a new edition [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=187.64s)]
*  All right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=194.6s)]
*  So how did you land an interview in the middle of a campaign at an important time? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  With President Trump or then candidate Trump? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=201.55999999999997s)]
*  So yeah, not a lot of people know this but back in 2022 we actually did [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  President Trump's very first ever podcast so he didn't know anything about podcasts [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=211.92s)]
*  You know, I don't know how tapped in he was to social media influencers and we got to give all credit to Dana White [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  So this was you know two years ago [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  I think it was right after the horrible Afghanistan pullout and I basically hit up Dana and I was like Dana [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=226.64s)]
*  What do you think about President Trump on the podcast? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  Like I feel like this is a great time to you know, just get him on and expose him to our audience and all the young people [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  So Dana just called him up and he basically endorsed us and told President Trump, you know, these guys are the real deal [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  They you know, they have a big following in the youth and President Trump told us he's like [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  I have no no idea who these guys are who the hell are the Nelk boys [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=251.2s)]
*  But he puts a lot of trust in Dana and he knows that when Dana tells him something it's the real deal [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  So we went on and we did it and it got 12 million views in less than 24 hours [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=260.64s)]
*  And then yeah YouTube deleted it. So they actually deleted it. They took it down [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=267.12s)]
*  You got canceled yeah, and actually President Trump President Trump called it on the podcast [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=274.04s)]
*  He said he looked at me and he said, you know, they're gonna delete this right and I was like there's no way like there's no way [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=278.72s)]
*  YouTube would make it this obvious and he's like no watch they're gonna delete it. So we upload it [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=283.72s)]
*  It's crushing and then yeah, YouTube takes it down and Sean. This is only two years ago [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=288.56s)]
*  So and now look how much has changed, you know, like like I told you I was at a YouTube event recently after the inauguration [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=293.68s)]
*  And there's a TV in the corner and there's a whole montage of Trump content [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=300.2s)]
*  Everyone's content that they did up with him leading up to the election [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=306.8s)]
*  And I'm just like wait two years ago you guys deleted our interview and now like you guys are celebrating him [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=309.8s)]
*  So it's a win at the end of the day for free speech [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=315.84s)]
*  I think all these social media platforms now are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=318.64s)]
*  There whether they're following the money or not, they're forced to change and I think it's a big win for free speech [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=321.96s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what maybe maybe I can give you guys a little bit of help I have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=327.24s)]
*  An attorney he's been involved in 22 Supreme Court cases. He's one of I think 21 of them [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=333.8s)]
*  Maybe he's just gonna have to write a little letter to YouTube to make sure you get monetized like everybody else [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  Otherwise, it's called discrimination. I don't know. Does that sound like a good idea? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=345.84s)]
*  It could be yeah, I mean I will say YouTube's been they've been really changing their their stuff up [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=349.64s)]
*  and I think that they know they have to and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=359.0s)]
*  They kind of see what we've done with the yeah [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=361.96s)]
*  Show me the money, but honestly, I I just love being on YouTube and I love just making videos for our fans [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0vlQ7VdlzI&t=366.15999999999997s)]
