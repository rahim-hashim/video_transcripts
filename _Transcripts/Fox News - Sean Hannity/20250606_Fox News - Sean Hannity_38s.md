**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME)
*  Tonight, the president's focus and the focus of the entire White House remains on passing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=0.0s)]
*  the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=5.16s)]
*  And as your audience just saw on Friday, just days ago, the president graciously hosted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=6.62s)]
*  Elon Musk in the Oval Office, and Elon thanked the president for his incredible leadership [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=11.68s)]
*  to cut waste, fraud and abuse in our government, which this one big, beautiful bill does. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=16.6s)]
*  So the only difference between Friday and today is Elon went back to his companies, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=22.52s)]
*  and as a businessman, he has a right to speak for his companies. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=26.92s)]
*  But as president, President Trump has a responsibility to fight for this country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-A6LuOUQME&t=30.560000000000002s)]
