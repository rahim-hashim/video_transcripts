# TARIFF TURMOIL: This is what’s 'scaring' China the most, expert says
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao)
*  is now senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=0.0s)]
*  Victor Davis Hansen, Fox Business host, Brian Bremberg, Victor Davis Hansen. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=3.52s)]
*  One thing that we're not factoring in with China, because they are ripping us off, but [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=8.52s)]
*  it pisses me more off that the European Union and Canada and Japan and South Korea and Taiwan [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=11.88s)]
*  also have been ripping us off. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=19.06s)]
*  And the president's not wrong in saying we've allowed them to do it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=21.44s)]
*  But in the case of China, I'm sorry, I don't see any other option. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=24.36s)]
*  They can talk as tough as they want today, but they need access to American markets. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=29.12s)]
*  And they already have a problem with Europe because of all the high tariffs they put on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=34.76s)]
*  European nations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=40.8s)]
*  And now they have been hitting back with tariffs against China and not as interested in Chinese [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=42.44s)]
*  products either. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=47.36s)]
*  So they got a bigger problem ahead of them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=48.36s)]
*  They got a lot of problems, internal and external. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=50.44s)]
*  They have 300,000 students here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=54.28s)]
*  Those are conveyors of technology back to China. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Some of them a small percentage, but nevertheless a small. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=60.68s)]
*  Some are engaged in espionage, and they don't want to lose those students. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=63.84s)]
*  We have almost no students in China. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=68.34s)]
*  So it's very asymmetrical. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=70.44s)]
*  But what's going on, I think, also is that if Donald Trump can cut a deal with one major [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=71.76s)]
*  player, and I think that Scott Besson can, preferably in Europe, because what he's basically [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=76.68s)]
*  saying, if it's reciprocal or no tariffs, zero tariffs, they're going to want to make [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=82.68s)]
*  a deal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=88.28s)]
*  You mentioned all the other extraneous issues, but for right now at this time, just one or [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=89.28s)]
*  two major players, and I think all the rest will follow. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=93.08s)]
*  And China's not going to like that because the Europeans know that China treats them [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=96.68s)]
*  as badly, almost as badly as it does us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=100.88s)]
*  And they've been waiting for American leadership to say, look, why don't we in the West and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  ice parts of Asia get together and have zero or reciprocal parity on tariffs? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=108.92s)]
*  Then we will have real leverage about the one player in the world that culturally, socially, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=115.24s)]
*  economically, politically, militarily is trying to leverage all of us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's what's scaring China the most. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=124.6s)]
*  One last thing very quickly, Sean. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=127.6s)]
*  I don't see it as mainstream versus Wall Street, mainstream versus Wall Street. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=130.76s)]
*  This is going to be good for Wall Street. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=135.56s)]
*  They've always told us that they wanted an administration to address the debt, the deficits, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  and even some of them, the trade deficits. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=143.0s)]
*  And then when you look at these data points, energy oil down, price of oil down, and you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=145.04s)]
*  look at inflation low and job creation astounding, well beyond, these are all the things that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=151.44s)]
*  Wall Street said were important for it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=157.6s)]
*  So I think it's going to help Main Street and Wall Street. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  We're just waiting for a major player to make a deal with zero or reciprocal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  And I think they're all going to fall in line and China is going to be left out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=168.0s)]
*  And I think people are going to want us to protect us, protect them from China. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=171.84s)]
*  Just like Panama, they want us to protect them from China. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more, Brian. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=180.28000000000003s)]
*  What I see happening is there's going to be deal after deal after deal, which for the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=182.12s)]
*  president is going to be win after win after win because we've taken this as a country [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=186.08s)]
*  for 50 or 60 years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=190.72s)]
*  And if I were advising the president, not that anyone would listen to me on economic [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=192.52s)]
*  matters, but I would say stay dialed into free and fair or reciprocal their choice. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=197.56s)]
*  And the next bit of negotiation, I don't think I'd get into the weeds of trade deficits [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=203.36s)]
*  or currency manipulation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  I'd be like, OK, we also want you to buy our energy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=211.12s)]
*  And it's in your best national interest to do it, because energy to me is the lifeblood [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  of every economy, number one. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=220.0s)]
*  And we've got more than anybody else on the face of the earth. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's where America gets really rich again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=224.0s)]
*  Couldn't agree with you more. Get a lot of deals done fast, Sean. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  The president has so much leverage right now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=230.8s)]
*  People don't appreciate that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=233.4s)]
*  He's trying to isolate China. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=235.12s)]
*  He's got countries surrounding China lined up at the White House ready to cut a deal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  And it's absolutely right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=241.72s)]
*  You cut a great deal with these countries. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=243.4s)]
*  You get a pattern going, just like the professor said. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=245.4s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the momentum is amazing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=248.6s)]
*  And people don't realize how quickly you can change the dynamic with China. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=251.2s)]
*  Their dependence on the U.S. is enormous. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=255.44s)]
*  If you isolate them, if you get companies to move manufacturing out of China, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=258.72s)]
*  if you get companies to move to the United States, we've got a budget blueprint, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  a tax bill that just passed the House and the Senate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=267.68s)]
*  So that's coming down the pike. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=270.68s)]
*  The incentives are enormous to be in the United States. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=272.28s)]
*  This is a moment of tremendous leverage for the president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=274.92s)]
*  He's created it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=278.76s)]
*  He's got the right people to exploit it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=280.0s)]
*  And he can make changes faster than anybody can expect because of what he's set up here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=282.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm telling you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=287.96s)]
*  And every one of these countries, all of them, this is where the leverage comes in. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=289.08s)]
*  They all need access to American markets and they want the American people's dollars. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=293.6s)]
*  Period. End of sentence. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=298.88s)]
*  Good to see you. Appreciate it, Brian. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=300.64s)]
*  Victor Davis Hanson, as always, thank you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64JxFiVa-Ao&t=302.24s)]
