# ‘DUMBEST LIE EVER TOLD’: Dems SCORCHED for alleged Biden cover-up
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E)
*  And welcome to this special edition of Hannity. All right. Who knew what? What did they know? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=0.0s)]
*  When did they know it? And who was really in charge of your country for the last four [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=4.96s)]
*  years? Now, remember earlier this week, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=9.88s)]
*  he sounded the alarm over Biden's use of the auto pen. He did it right here on this show. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=14.68s)]
*  Here's a reminder. Who was giving the authority for use of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=21.32s)]
*  auto pen. Remember, Sean, there was more activity in the last 100 days of the Biden administration [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=26.44s)]
*  than the first three and a half years of the Biden administration. Many of the far reaching [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  executive orders were signed during the last 100 days and they were all signed by the auto pen. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=36.36s)]
*  Ah, the auto pen. Three and a half years, more than the last 100 days. Did Joe know about it? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=44.6s)]
*  We'd like answers. Anyway, for years we on this program, we made it important to tell you the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  truth about Joe Biden, his obvious, very obvious cognitive decline. We started reporting on it in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=56.92s)]
*  2019. We'll get to that in a minute. All the state run legacy media mob and Democrats, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=63.64s)]
*  they were lying to you day in and day out. Cheap, fake videos. They weren't cheap, fake videos. Now, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  finally, the truth has been revealed about this abuse of the office of the presidency [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=75.0s)]
*  and the subsequent coverup, which has now quickly become the biggest presidential White House scandal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=81.0s)]
*  in our country's history. Now the media will ignore that too. The left so hated Donald Trump. They [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=88.04s)]
*  hated him so much that they were willing to put your national security at risk. And as one aid [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=93.64s)]
*  even admitted to fake Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, even act undemocratically and democracies [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=100.04s)]
*  in peril, they said before the election. And meanwhile, it was by them just to stop Donald [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=107.0s)]
*  Trump and just show proof of life occasionally. You know, he doesn't really have to run things [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  as if he's reelected. We'll just, you know, trot him out every once in a while, let everybody know [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=118.04s)]
*  he's alive and, and let him go back and take a nap. And by the way, let unknown people run the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  country. Almost every Democrat White House staffer, so-called journalist, I said in 2007, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=128.2s)]
*  journalism is dead. Everyone in the fake news media mob, they all work to deceive the American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=135.64s)]
*  public because they don't like Donald Trump and they don't like the American people and their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=142.28s)]
*  choice. You all deserve answers. And finally, we are starting to get some, we will be unrelenting [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=147.0s)]
*  on this show. We're going to get to the bottom of all of this. Now, according to fake Jake [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=153.48s)]
*  and Alex Thompson's book, Biden needed a script just to get through cabinet meetings with one [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=158.76s)]
*  cabinet member telling Tapper and Thompson quote, the cabinet meetings were terrible and at times [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=163.88s)]
*  uncomfortable. And they were from the beginning. I don't recall a great cabinet meeting in terms [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  of his presence. So they were all scripted and no kidding. I'm serious. I'm serious. No kidding. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=174.76s)]
*  And don't forget, Joe couldn't even conduct the full meetings himself. Remember he had to turn it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=181.56s)]
*  over to Dr. Jill, his wife. She wasn't elected to any position. Take a look. This is the first time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=186.68s)]
*  Jill has joined us and it goes to show how important the issue is, which she's about to speak to both [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=193.32s)]
*  of us today at the top of our meeting. Jill's going to give an update on the house initiative, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=198.84s)]
*  White House initiative to fundamentally change the approach and fund how we approach and fund [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=204.68s)]
*  women's health services. So I'd like to turn it over to Jill and for any comments she has and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=212.28s)]
*  it's all yours, kid. All yours, kid. He reads the script. You know, the speech writers, according to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  the book, shrank not only the vocabulary, but they shrank the speech because they knew he was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=224.68s)]
*  incapable of getting through this. Now here's a question a lot of people probably are not going [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=229.96s)]
*  to like that I ask. What did his family know? What did his wife know? What did his children know? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=235.08s)]
*  What did his grandchildren know? They had to see far worse than the rest of the country. You probably [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=241.8s)]
*  only saw Joe at his best. They would be complicit. Also to me, tough questions need to be asked of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=247.0s)]
*  every single family member, starting with Dr. Jill and Hunter. Now yesterday, when asked about [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  Jill Biden potentially testifying before Congress, White House press secretary Caroline Levitt had [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=260.52s)]
*  this to say. Is the president satisfied with aides only sitting for these transcribed interviews or [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=265.8s)]
*  would he also like to see some kind of testimony from the former first lady, Dr. Biden? I think, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=274.52s)]
*  frankly, the former first lady should certainly speak up about what she saw in regards to her [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=280.6s)]
*  husband and when she saw it and what she knew, because I think anybody looking again at the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=285.72s)]
*  videos and photo evidence of Joe Biden with your own eyes and a little bit of common sense can see [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=291.32000000000005s)]
*  this was a clear cover up. And Jill Biden was certainly complicit in that cover up. There's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=296.92s)]
*  documentation, video evidence of her clearly shielding her husband away from the cameras. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=303.24s)]
*  They were just on The View last week. She was saying everything is fine. She's still lying to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=308.44s)]
*  the American people. She still thinks the American public are so stupid that they're going to believe [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=312.6s)]
*  her lies. And frankly, it's insulting and she needs to answer for it. Remember, Joey, you'd [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=316.92s)]
*  shake like air, nobody's there. And then somebody would have to come out. Oh, no, come on, walk off [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=322.2s)]
*  this way, Joe. We went on, that went on for four years. What we're seeing now is only the tip of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  the iceberg as it relates to the scandal. And frankly, this is like the dumbest lie ever told. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=332.84s)]
*  Democrats, their allies and the state run legacy media mob, they simply asked you not to believe [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  your lying eyes. For years, Joe Biden's cognitive decline was readily apparent to everyone. From the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=346.12s)]
*  moment Biden jumped in the presidential race, we identified it in 2019. His struggles were clear, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=354.28s)]
*  unambiguous, they were obvious. This was not the same guy that was Obama's vice president, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=362.2s)]
*  not the same guy that was a senator. He didn't walk the same, he didn't look the same, he didn't [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=368.68s)]
*  sound the same. And you know what? Don't take my word for it. Take a look at some of, well, the low lights. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=373.64s)]
*  If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330. We choose truth over facts. Poor kids are just as bright and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=381.0s)]
*  just as talented as white kids. Play the radio, make sure the television, excuse me, make sure [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=391.16s)]
*  you have the record player on at night, the phone, make sure the kids hear words. It's time for America [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=396.68s)]
*  to get back up on its feet and once again fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=402.6s)]
*  self-evident. Sounds corny, not a joke, think about it. We hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=408.12s)]
*  All men and women created by the goal, you know the thing, you know how we talk about it. Are we [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=414.6s)]
*  the people? The record player, truth over facts created by the thing, you know the God, the creator [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=420.52s)]
*  of everything. Democrats, the media mob lied to you over and over again. They claimed that they showed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=429.56s)]
*  you the real Joe Biden but they did not. On this program we take great pride in telling you the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  truth. We showed you the real Joe Biden. We sounded the alarm starting in 2019 about his struggles. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=441.79999999999995s)]
*  We did it from the very beginning. We have the tape to prove it. Take a look. There is a panic. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=448.52s)]
*  All Joe being Joe, the verbal mishaps are piling up by the second, raising serious questions among [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=454.28s)]
*  Democrats about his viability. It is fair for every American to ask whether or not this 78 year old [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=461.88s)]
*  has the strength, the stamina, the focus and the capacity to handle what is by far the toughest [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=469.0s)]
*  job in the world. Now to me, quid pro quo Joe seems to be in a rapid state of decline and not [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=475.24s)]
*  up to the rigors needed even on a campaign. Only after his disastrous debate with President Trump [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=480.68s)]
*  last June when it became apparent he had no chance of winning re-election, oh all of a sudden they [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=486.92s)]
*  noticed everything we'd been telling you from 2019 onward. Did the left reverse course and state the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=492.6s)]
*  obvious? No, they did it from political expediency. This was a man completely incapable of doing [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=499.56s)]
*  what is the hardest job in the world. Amid the growing evidence of the biggest cover-up [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=507.16s)]
*  in White House and presidential history, Biden reemerged today to deliver a Memorial Day address [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=512.44s)]
*  nearly a week late and let's just say he didn't exactly ease anyone's concerns. Take a look. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=519.8s)]
*  Our politics have become so divided and so bitter all the years I've been doing this and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=525.72s)]
*  never thought we'd get to this point but we are. Our troops don't wear a uniform that says I'm a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=532.52s)]
*  Democrat or I'm a Republican. It says I'm an American. I'm an American, that's who I am. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  Every nation was founded on geography, ethnicity, some unifying principle but not an idea. The idea [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=544.2s)]
*  America's found now we hold these truths to be self-evident. The law men and women are created [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=553.3199999999999s)]
*  equal and doubt by the creator of certain and neoliberal rights, life, liberty, pursuit of that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=558.1999999999999s)]
*  we made it. That's who we are. American democracy has endured for nearly 250 years. Every generation, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=563.16s)]
*  every generation, every generation has to fight to maintain that democracy every time, every generation. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  Now after screaming those remarks he spoke to reporters and launched into more rambling, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  mumbling, bumbling, bizarre moments. Take a look. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  So I feel like everybody expects. I've done it all because I'm a Memorial. I do it every day. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=589.96s)]
*  And there's also been a lot of discussion recently about your mental and physical [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=597.96s)]
*  capabilities while you were in office. You can see that mentally incompetent and I can't walk. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=602.52s)]
*  I can't walk. I can't beat the hell out of both of them. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=608.92s)]
*  Do you want to reply to any of those reports and also to the fact that there are some Democrats [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=611.88s)]
*  who are now questioning whether you should have run for re-election? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=617.16s)]
*  Why did you run against me? Do you have anything to say to the press secretary about [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=621.08s)]
*  what happened to your wife yesterday at the briefing? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=627.0s)]
*  I don't know who the press secretary is. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=632.92s)]
*  He can't even climb stairs. He can't even stand up straight. He can't even ride a bicycle. He's [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ3GCx0t99E&t=635.0s)]
