# Blue state ballot measure RIPPED for praising accused assassin: 'DELUSIONAL'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY)
*  All right, more insanity from some on the radical left as they continue to idolize Luigi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=0.0s)]
*  Mangione. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=6.44s)]
*  You might recall he's the guy accused of killing in cold blood the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=7.44s)]
*  a father and a husband. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=13.16s)]
*  The attorney general, Pam Bondi, rightly says she wants him to face the death penalty. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=15.36s)]
*  Politico said today, well, that's quote, how Trump loses Gen Z. Seriously? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=20.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=26.52s)]
*  Is this alleged killer is too popular with young people? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=27.68s)]
*  Let me try and grasp this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=31.52s)]
*  If you want to entice Gen Z to vote for you, you have to embrace assassins? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=33.76s)]
*  I'm finding that hard to comprehend. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=40.28s)]
*  And meanwhile, in California, someone actually named a ballot measure after Luigi Mangione. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=42.44s)]
*  It aims to quote, prevent insurance companies from denying claims. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=48.5s)]
*  So not only are they praising the guy, they're, you know, taking up his supposed cause as [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=51.7s)]
*  though they're pulling lines right out of his manifesto. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=57.64s)]
*  So after four years of endlessly decrying so-called insurrection and domestic terrorism [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=61.6s)]
*  and pretending that taking it on was the most important thing ever in the entire world, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=67.64s)]
*  the left has now turned an alleged killer, an assassin into a folk hero, and they're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=73.6s)]
*  encouraging actual domestic terrorism against Tesla and all things Elon Musk, just like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=78.16s)]
*  How many, including Kamala Harris, how many Democrats supported or lied about the 574 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=84.52s)]
*  riots in the summer of 2020? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=91.88s)]
*  You know, they killed two dozen Americans, injured thousands of cops, billions of property [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=93.64s)]
*  damage. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=98.12s)]
*  You know, this level of insanity is out of my wheelhouse. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=99.12s)]
*  So let's ask the host. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=102.4s)]
*  I've asked Dr. Drew on Rumble, Dr. Drew Pinsky. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=104.2s)]
*  OK, as I said, it's out of my wheelhouse. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=107.88s)]
*  Why are they praising, you know, assassins? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=111.8s)]
*  And why are they, why are they so silent on all the domestic terrorism against Elon Musk? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=115.52s)]
*  Yeah, you've characterized it properly. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=122.16s)]
*  It's interesting, in the last segment, you guys used the word crazy a number of times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=125.96s)]
*  I'm perfectly comfortable with that term, except I want to refine it a little more, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=129.64s)]
*  which is if you are not well emotionally, mentally, you are not accepting reality or [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=133.72s)]
*  delusional, you're somehow distorting reality. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=139.52s)]
*  You can't accept it on its own terms. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=142.84s)]
*  And delusionality has been alive and well for quite some time, hysteria and delusion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  And the idea that this kid who cold bloodedly planned a murder, as you said, of a father, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=150.56s)]
*  because by the way, the California ballot was designed for insurance companies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=158.2s)]
*  If you read what Luigi Mangione was concerned about, he really, his understanding of the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=164.48s)]
*  health insurance situation was about an 11th grader's. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  He actually had a delusional preoccupation with corporate greed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=174.2s)]
*  And it's just that health care was in his crosshairs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  The reality is the people that are delusional preoccupied about him don't even understand [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  what he was thinking about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=187.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Now to another topic, despite President Trump's decisive win, some blue states, they can't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=190.76s)]
*  stop pushing woke lunacy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Now, Dr. Drew, that includes Colorado. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=198.12s)]
*  Democrats in that state legislature are now pushing a bill that would make it a violation [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=201.24s)]
*  of discrimination laws if you refer to a transgender person by the name that they use before their [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=206.6s)]
*  transition or to call them a different gender than the one that they say they are. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=213.84s)]
*  Under the law, Colorado judges could make decisions in child custody cases based on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=219.52s)]
*  whether one of the parents does not accept the transgender status of their child. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=225.56s)]
*  So much for parental rights, Dr. Drew. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=230.08s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  It's actually a heartbreaking situation that the government is going to get this involved [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=235.8s)]
*  in the relationship between children and their parents and or physicians and the kids they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=240.28s)]
*  are taking care of. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=245.58s)]
*  It's really rather pathetic. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=247.08s)]
*  And just the idea that if Dad says Susie instead of Sam, he's going to lose his relationship [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=248.96s)]
*  with that child. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=254.24s)]
*  I mean, look, the idea that the government is going to make things better and we need [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=255.52s)]
*  a centralized authority crawling into every aspect of our life. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=261.32s)]
*  That is the reason you have a President Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=265.64s)]
*  I don't understand why they keep doubling down on that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=267.6s)]
*  It's something that I guess some people wish they could want them to continue doing it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=270.8s)]
*  So they continue to lose. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=275.12s)]
*  Hey, Dr. Drew, guess what? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=277.24s)]
*  Parents are not potted plants. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=279.6s)]
*  Parental rights actually mean something. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=281.44s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=283.48s)]
*  The government needs to stay the hell out of people's private lives. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=284.48s)]
*  The left tells us that all the time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=288.22s)]
*  Strange world we live in. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank God you're here to clear it up. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  Dr. Drew Pinsky, thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6siVdLUPBcY&t=293.92s)]
