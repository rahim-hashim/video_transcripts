**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0)
*  United States Ambassador to NATO Matt Whitaker joins us now with reaction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador Whitaker it's a real pleasure to have you here what do you make of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  this China-U.S. deal is it about trade in tariffs is there anything else in there [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  like tick-tock fentanyl Uyghurs Taiwan pick a card any card yeah right and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=13.02s)]
*  you're absolutely right and it's good to be with you my friend you know I think [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=19.82s)]
*  what President Trump sees is a advantage that China has taken of the United States [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=22.66s)]
*  in our markets to a tune of about 300 billion dollars of a trade deficit we [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=27.86s)]
*  run with China and you know and quite frankly Europe is not too far behind it [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=32.74s)]
*  250 billion dollars and President Trump has said we're not gonna allow these [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=36.26s)]
*  countries to take advantage of us while they sell products into our markets and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=41.06s)]
*  don't take our products whether it's our farm commodities from places like my [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=44.739999999999995s)]
*  home state of Iowa or whether it's our you know manufactured products and so [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=48.94s)]
*  you know he is drawing a line in the sand and I think he's getting everybody [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=52.9s)]
*  come to the table obviously the Chinese are desperate to make a deal this would [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=56.14s)]
*  you know crush their economy because they they only sell stuff and export [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=59.74s)]
*  things and so I think President Trump has this situation well in hand right [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=63.82s)]
*  now and he's gonna cut some great deals for the American people which is exactly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=68.62s)]

*  categories different services and goods providers so people are coming to the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=84.86s)]
*  table to try to get rid of these tariffs meaning get a bilateral trade deal which [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=89.9s)]
*  countries do you think particularly in Europe or the EU itself or come to the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=95.18s)]

*  NATO partners in NATO countries knowing that President Trump means business when [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=190.22s)]
*  he says you all better pay more to the common defense and your dues pay more [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=194.26s)]
*  toward Ukraine they're paid about a hundred billion dollars in Europe we're [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=197.66s)]
*  on the hook for 350 billion so far I see Germany investing a half a trillion [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=200.5s)]
*  dollars in its infrastructure and energy and defense what is it like for you to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=205.34s)]

*  have big issues to resolve we're heading into the NATO summit at the end of June [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=222.58s)]
*  where we're going to get a commitment from our European allies and Canada to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=227.06s)]
*  spend a lot more on the collective defense and on their individual defense [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=231.3s)]
*  you know I think this Ukrainian war has woke up a lot of our European allies [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=235.82s)]
*  they see the threats and and they're doing the investment you mentioned [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=241.5s)]
*  Germany but you know since Donald Trump was elected just in the last one hundred [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  seen four allies commit to five percent of their GDP on defense and we've seen [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  another ten that have dramatically increased or have committed to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=257.46s)]
*  dramatically increase and I think we're going to continue to see that trend [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=260.82s)]
*  because they understand that Donald Trump's not screwing around and that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=263.14s)]
*  they need to step up and they need to equalize their spending on defense well [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P64wyUhKVj0&t=266.53999999999996s)]
