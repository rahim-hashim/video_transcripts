# Hannity reveals why Dems are in ‘big trouble’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY)
*  But we begin with Chuck Schumer praising Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=0.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=3.48s)]
*  I was born in Brooklyn, the same place where Donald Trump's family comes from. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=5.2s)]
*  His father and my grandfather were builders together in Brooklyn. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=9.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=14.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=15.48s)]
*  Even when he was much younger, you knew that he was going to go places. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=16.48s)]
*  Senator Schumer and Mr. Trump are good friends. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  They both have a passion for life, and you get that immediately, talking to him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=23.0s)]
*  Obviously a few years ago, before Trump was president, but he was kind of right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=28.04s)]
*  Now Schumer has nothing nice to say. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=32.36s)]
*  He's already at his lowest popularity rate in New York state, according to the just-released [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=34.52s)]
*  CNN poll out today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  AOC, by the way, on the rise big time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=41.8s)]
*  So question tonight is, are Chuck's days numbered? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=44.68s)]
*  But if there is one constant in the Democratic Party, it's that they don't really, truly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=48.6s)]
*  believe in anything. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=54.6s)]
*  Everything they say, everything they do, is about their own political power. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=56.04s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=59.84s)]
*  In 2017, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen bashed Trump on Twitter. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=61.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=66.92s)]
*  Saying, quote, we should be focused on deporting MS-13, not scholarship winners. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=67.92s)]
*  That's the same guy that last week, you know, went to visit the deported suspected MS-13 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=74.64s)]
*  gang member to bring him back to this country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=80.28s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen threw a fit, even got on that plane to El Salvador demanding his immediate [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=83.84s)]
*  return. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  That would be political grandstanding at its worst. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  And this is the same Chris Van Hollen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Couldn't even pick up a telephone and speak with the families of young women who were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=95.68s)]
*  raped and murdered in his state by unvetted illegal immigrants. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=99.76s)]
*  And just yesterday, another illegal immigrant was charged with the murder of a 23-year-old [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  woman whose body was found in a Maryland forest. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=110.44s)]
*  Will he pick up the phone now? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=114.16s)]
*  But we have yet to see any kind of hysteria from Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=116.12s)]
*  I'm sure he's just very worn out. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=120.32s)]
*  He's probably very tired from his big trip to El Salvador. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=122.6s)]
*  But the hypocrisy, it doesn't end there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=126.2s)]
*  Let's go to Earth Day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=128.64s)]
*  Of course, Al Gore forcing his way back into the spotlight. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=130.6s)]
*  This time he is honoring our planet by comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=135.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=141.18s)]
*  I understand very well why it is wrong to compare Adolf Hitler's third right to any [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=142.18s)]
*  other movement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=147.34s)]
*  It was uniquely evil, full stop. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=148.86s)]
*  I get it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=151.1s)]
*  But there are important lessons from the history of that emergent evil. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=152.74s)]
*  But it was Habermas's mentor, Theodore Adorno, who wrote that the first step in that nation's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=156.1s)]
*  descent into hell was, and I quote, the conversion of all questions of truth into questions of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=164.66s)]
*  power. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=174.22s)]
*  He described how the Nazis, and I quote again, attacked the very heart of the distinction [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  between true and false, end quote. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=182.06s)]
*  The Trump administration is insisting on trying to create their own preferred version of reality. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=186.78s)]
*  Of course, I shouldn't compare people to Hitler, but I'll do it anyway. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=194.78s)]
*  Just like most of his other colleagues in the Democratic Party, Al Gore is a complete [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=199.62s)]
*  fraud and hypocrite. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=205.66s)]
*  He's like the original climate hysteria hypocrite of all time. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=207.3s)]
*  Everything he says is a ploy to get money and power. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=213.02s)]
*  So tonight, time for a quick Hannity history lesson. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=215.86s)]
*  I promise you're not going to hear it anywhere else in the media. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=219.02s)]
*  Let's go back to 2007. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=221.9s)]
*  That same guy, Al Gore, warned of a planetary emergency. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  He said the planet has a fever and that humanity could soon be in peril. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  That of course was false. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=234.3s)]
*  In 2009, Gore said that 75% of the entire polar ice cap will melt in the next five to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=235.86s)]
*  seven years. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=242.34s)]
*  That was also totally false. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  By 2015, the ice caps even expanded in many areas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=245.46s)]
*  He also warned about the extinction of the coral reefs. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  Oops, but in 2019, the reefs grew by 2%. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=252.78s)]
*  This came after decades of dire varying claims about climate change, climate cooling, climate [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=256.42s)]
*  warming. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  Then, you know, if it snows, you have an excuse. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  If it doesn't snow, if there's an earthquake, if there's not an earthquake, if there's a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=266.14s)]
*  hurricane, if there's not a hurricane, always have an excuse for something. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  This came after years of wild claims about climate change. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  Let's take you back to 1975. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=276.7s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=278.94s)]
*  That's Newsweek. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=279.94s)]
*  They predicted a cooling world with an ice age by the mid 1980s. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=280.98s)]
*  Obviously, they were wrong. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=285.7s)]
*  In 1995, the New York Times reported that beaches on the east coast of the U.S. would [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=287.1s)]
*  be wiped out by 2021. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=292.46s)]
*  Four years ago, in 2006, Time magazine claimed that the Earth was at a tipping point and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=295.26s)]
*  that we all should be very, very worried. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=301.74s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=304.42s)]
*  Democrats, they never actually believe that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=305.58s)]
*  Al Gore, of all people, look at this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  This was a Hannity exclusive video, film jetting all over the country in a private jet. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=311.18s)]
*  That jet seats about 14, 16 people. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=316.98s)]
*  There's only two people on it and the pilots. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=319.38s)]
*  So the same thing with Biden's climates are. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=322.38s)]
*  John Kerry, I need important work and I need to get there quickly. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=325.1s)]
*  That's why I get to take a private jet and I want you to get rid of your SUV. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=329.66s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=334.26s)]
*  Just this week. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=335.42s)]
*  I love this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=336.42s)]
*  AOC Bernie Sanders. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=337.42s)]
*  Look at them right there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=339.94s)]
*  That's a nice plane they're getting out of there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=340.94s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=342.5s)]
*  They were filmed stepping off their private jet. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=343.5s)]
*  I'm not against private jets, but don't lecture everybody about their SUVs or their caravans [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=345.42s)]
*  for crying out loud. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=350.20000000000005s)]
*  And remember in 2019, it was AOC claiming that the world was going to end in 12 years. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=351.98s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=358.74s)]
*  Because of rising CO2 levels. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=359.74s)]
*  But now she's riding around leaving a huge carbon footprint with a private jet for her [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=361.54s)]
*  and her mentor, Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=367.4s)]
*  And meanwhile, environmental activists in New York, they painted Wall Street's iconic [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=369.64s)]
*  bull to show their dedication to the climate cult and socialism. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=373.88s)]
*  But then frantically, they cleaned up their mess when the cops arrived on the scene. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  They don't actually care enough about their cause to go to jail. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=381.96s)]
*  Now, of course, if you're in Minnesota and you damage private property, no consequences [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=385.68s)]
*  in Tim Wall's state, so long as your cause aligns with the radical left Democratic extremists. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=391.4s)]
*  For example, a far left Minnesota state employee was just gifted a get out of jail free card [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  by a woke district attorney after allegedly causing more than $20,000 in damage to several [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=403.73999999999995s)]
*  Tesla vehicles. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  Sounds like domestic terrorism to me, but what would I know? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Make no mistake, at the end of the day, this has nothing to do with the earth cooling global [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=415.44s)]
*  warming, which has evolved into the generic climate change. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=419.90000000000003s)]
*  So if it gets warm, they have a name for it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=423.14s)]
*  If it gets cold, they have a name for it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=426.26s)]
*  If it snows, they've got a name for it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=428.06s)]
*  If it doesn't snow, they have a name for it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=430.02000000000004s)]
*  Look at this list. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=432.18s)]
*  It's the Green New Deal. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=433.18s)]
*  Look everything on this list has nothing to do really with climate climate warming, climate [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=435.02000000000004s)]
*  cooling, climate changing is the left's mechanism for Marxism, stateism as represented by that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=440.7s)]
*  list. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  To each according to their need, from each according to their ability. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=449.34s)]
*  The only thing Democrats really care about actually is political power and you being [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=453.7s)]
*  dependent on them. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=458.53999999999996s)]
*  And this is the result. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  Look at this heartbreaking video. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  This is a little girl in San Francisco attempting to ride her scooter down a sidewalk that's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  lined with strung out drug addicts. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=467.94s)]
*  Great job, Gavin. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=470.23999999999995s)]
*  Now Democrats want to control every aspect of your life on top of what they already control. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=471.5s)]
*  You know, they've done so well giving you nearly $40 trillion in debt. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=476.54s)]
*  The worst schools, in spite of spending more money in the entire industrialized world, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=481.32s)]
*  they brought Social Security and Medicaid to the brink of bankruptcy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=486.64s)]
*  And by the way, how's law and order and safety and security working out in your town, in [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=491.42s)]
*  your city since the defund, dismantle, no bail laws were implemented by the left? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=496.82s)]
*  Now even leftist Governor Newsom, he's now trying, good luck Gavin, to distance himself [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=503.1s)]
*  from the very decisions that created this horrible scene. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=509.3s)]
*  But just this week, his parole board, they ordered the release of a man who was convicted [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=513.94s)]
*  of beating a toddler to death, a two-year-old toddler to death after spending just 15 years [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=518.28s)]
*  in prison. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=524.2s)]
*  And by the way, Newsom should know that his party's base, they don't take too kindly [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=525.2s)]
*  to self-reflection. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=530.0s)]
*  Let's look at what happened to Rom-Rombo-Deadfish Emanuel when he dared to lightly criticize [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=531.56s)]
*  the Democratic Party's radical agenda. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=536.6199999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  We were really south on kitchen table issues. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=539.8399999999999s)]
*  We weren't really good about the family room issues. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  I disagree with you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=545.68s)]
*  I disagree with you 100 million percent. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=547.04s)]
*  The only room we were doing really well was the bathroom. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=548.56s)]
*  And that's the smallest room in the house. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=552.1199999999999s)]
*  That is such a ****. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=553.4s)]
*  That is a total **** that is buying into the right-wing media narrative. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=554.8399999999999s)]
*  And I'm so sick of Democrats like you selling out and saying this. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=558.68s)]
*  Wow, Rom has not left us enough. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=563.76s)]
*  He's pretty left. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=566.92s)]
*  Democrats are in big trouble. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=568.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=569.4s)]
*  Because their radical ideology, it has failed miserably. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=570.4s)]
*  Even some in Hollywood can see the handwriting's on the wall. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=574.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=577.52s)]
*  This is where I would push back. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=579.12s)]
*  When I see this kind of insight and passion being directed at the current administration [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=580.68s)]
*  and the lack of this kind of insight and passion being directed at the previous administration, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=588.12s)]
*  where again, I'm not talking about you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=592.88s)]
*  I'm talking about left-leaning news media organizations who are kind of like, la la [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=595.0s)]
*  la la la, everything's fine, look the environments. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=600.0s)]
*  I mean, look, the economy's great, la la la, immigration's not that much of a problem. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=602.32s)]
*  And really, being Cleopatra, queen of denial. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=607.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=611.08s)]
*  Boom. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6zS-LuMiWY&t=612.08s)]
