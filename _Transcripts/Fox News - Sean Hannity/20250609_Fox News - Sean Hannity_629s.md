# BREAKING: Bondi issues MASSIVE warning to wanted man now identified by the FBI
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4)
*  I'm going to forego my monologue for now, because of this breaking news, as you can [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=0.0s)]
*  see, chaos about to unfold in Los Angeles, in California tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=5.0s)]
*  There are people that this country can blame. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=9.8s)]
*  The fact that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas and every single Democrat [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=12.44s)]
*  that lied to the American people and said, the board is closed, the board is secure, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  the board is closed, the board is secure, and told you not to believe what your own [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=22.84s)]
*  eyes were showing you, they are to blame for this. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=27.64s)]
*  Add to that, sanctuary city mayors in blue cities and blue states, sanctuary state governors [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=31.48s)]
*  like Gavin Newsom, they allowed this illegal immigration to get out of control, out of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=37.04s)]
*  hand, and now you see that officers' lives are in risk tonight and property damage could [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=43.08s)]
*  be great. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=48.44s)]
*  Here now with reaction is the U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=49.44s)]
*  We know the restrictions that local police are under, for example, in a sanctuary state [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=54.2s)]
*  like California. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  They're prohibited to even inquire about an individual's status during a routine, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  you know, course of work. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=67.6s)]
*  They're forbidden from holding illegals until they can be transferred to ICE. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=69.08s)]
*  Federal authorities, federal agencies are prohibited from commandeering local authorities. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=74.4s)]
*  We do have the Supremacy Clause. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  OK, I get it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=81.08s)]
*  You know, taxpayer-funded healthcare education and other benefits for illegals in California, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  we know what Gavin Newsom's going to do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=88.44s)]
*  I'm not interested. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=90.48s)]
*  He's not capable of doing the job. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=91.48s)]
*  He's too ideologically radical left, and he hates Donald Trump too much. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  What can this federal government do to protect law enforcement and the people in L.A.? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=98.48s)]
*  Sean, what we're going to do is we are going to enforce the law regardless of what they [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Look at all those great men and women in the LAPD. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=112.12s)]
*  We are going to protect them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=114.76s)]
*  If they will not protect them and prosecute people that abuse the LAPD in terms during [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  a civil unrest under 18 USC 231, we can prosecute federally people who assault state law enforcement [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  officers when they are in jail. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=132.4s)]
*  We can prosecute them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=134.44s)]
*  We can prosecute them. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=136.44s)]
*  Federally, people who assault state law enforcement officers with a maximum of five years in prison, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=138.8s)]
*  and we are going to do it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=144.6s)]
*  We are going to prosecute them federally. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=146.24s)]
*  If California won't protect their law enforcement, we will protect the LAPD and the sheriff's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=148.44s)]
*  office out there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=153.68s)]
*  Not only that, we have nine open cases right now and more to come on assaulting federal [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=155.24s)]
*  officers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=161.28s)]
*  The Molotov cocktail cases that you've seen, we've charged one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=162.36s)]
*  More to come. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=166.32s)]
*  Three outstanding. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=167.32s)]
*  You saw they began to loot last night, going into 7-elevens, going into drugstores. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=169.2s)]
*  Typically, you don't charge those. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=173.64s)]
*  We do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=175.56s)]
*  Under federal law now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=176.56s)]
*  Under the Hobbs Act, we are charging robbery. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=177.72s)]
*  You loot a business in California. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  You are looking at maximum of 20 years in prison. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  You spit on a federal law enforcement officer no more. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=186.2s)]
*  As President Trump said, you spit, we hit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=191.72s)]
*  Get ready. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=194.6s)]
*  You spit on a federal law enforcement officer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=195.68s)]
*  We are going to charge you with a crime federally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=197.6s)]
*  You are looking at up to five years maximum in prison. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=200.0s)]
*  The cinder block case, Sean, remember that case? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  We have breaking news right now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=208.0s)]
*  The case where the guy was breaking up the cinder blocks and he was throwing them at [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  police cars. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=215.68s)]
*  The police officer, I'm sorry, the federal officer had injured his hand. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=216.68s)]
*  He was wearing a mask. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=221.28s)]
*  The FBI has identified him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=222.76s)]
*  Bill Issaily, our incredible U.S. attorney out there working with ATF DEA and the FBI [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=225.64s)]
*  have been doing a remarkable job. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=231.44s)]
*  That guy has just been identified and they are doing a search warrant on his house as [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=233.6s)]
*  we speak. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=239.4s)]
*  And he has been identified. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=241.2s)]
*  See his face. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=242.6s)]
*  He is going to be on, his name is Reyes, he is going to be on the most wanted list. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=243.6s)]
*  You have broken the news. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=249.2s)]
*  His face is out there right now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=250.32s)]
*  That's him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=252.36s)]
*  He has been identified by great police work by the FBI. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=253.52s)]
*  So you can run, you can't hide. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=258.04s)]
*  We are coming after you federally. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=260.5s)]
*  If you assault a police officer, if you rob a store, if you loot, if you spit on a police [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=263.08s)]
*  officer, we are coming after you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=268.64s)]
*  Okay, I want to be very clear. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=271.04s)]
*  You said a lot there, Pam. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=272.8s)]
*  There is a lot that I didn't know that the federal government had authority on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=273.8s)]
*  There is a federal law against hurting state law enforcement. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=277.6s)]
*  So if California won't do their job, remember back in 2020 with 574 riots, we had two dozen [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=281.44s)]
*  dead Americans, thousands of injured cops, pelted, very similar, bricks, rocks, bottles, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=288.16s)]
*  molotov cocktails. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  They didn't do a good job in Oakland. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  They didn't do a good job in other parts of the country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=297.04s)]
*  If you spit at officers or in this case you now have apparently a good lead and you are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=299.8s)]
*  going after this guy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  There were a number of people throwing cinder blocks and big ones at patrol cars. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  You're saying that federally speaking it doesn't matter what the state of California do. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=312.56s)]
*  And how big an issue is the supremacy clause in terms of who has jurisdiction here? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  We have jurisdiction. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=322.98s)]
*  And under 18 USC 231, we are going to go after you if you assault an LAPD officer, if you [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  assault a deputy, we are going to go after you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=333.04s)]
*  If three or more persons in the course of civil disobedience injure or hurt a law enforcement [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=336.8s)]
*  officer, what's going on right now? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=342.76s)]
*  You're watching that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=344.08s)]
*  We are going to prosecute you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=345.08s)]
*  No longer will you be left out alone in the cold. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=346.96s)]
*  What they've been doing to them. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=350.4s)]
*  If California won't protect state officers, we will. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=351.4s)]
*  They're rioting out there and are great men and women in the FBI. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=356.38s)]
*  They have a command center set up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=360.0s)]
*  And again, look at the guy with the mask who we got tonight. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=362.04s)]
*  We have identified him. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  Our FBI agents, our U.S. attorney, they have been working around the clock. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=366.22s)]
*  We've all been on the phone with them all day long. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  And we're coming after you. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  And we will find you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=374.72s)]
*  The mask won't protect you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=376.12s)]
*  Technology is amazing right now. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=377.88s)]
*  We are tracking you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=380.24s)]
*  We will find you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  And you will go to jail. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  And we will prosecute you federally. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, Pam, I was listening earlier today and—or over the weekend, and I felt so sad for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  the LAPD chief. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=394.2s)]
*  And he was out there saying, we are being overwhelmed by riots. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=396.8s)]
*  This is the opposite. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  This is the antithesis of what the governor out there has been saying, what the mayor [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=403.0s)]
*  of Los Angeles has been saying. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=407.6s)]
*  And he talked about the danger of—that his officers out there are facing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=410.8s)]
*  I want people to listen, because they've been lied to. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=417.12s)]
*  Oh, they were told by Cory Booker, Maxine Waters and Kamala Harris and by, you know, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=419.91999999999996s)]

*  Well, let's listen to the LAPD chief. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=430.64s)]
*  We are overwhelmed as far as the number of people out there engaged in this type of activity. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=434.56s)]
*  And the type of things that they're doing, they'll take backpacks, and the backpack [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=440.68s)]
*  will have a cinderblock in it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=445.24s)]
*  They have a hammer, and they'll break up the cinderblock and use that, pass it around [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  to throw at officers, to throw at cars and throw at other people. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=450.68s)]
*  We've seen people with hammers, and you've broadcasted breaking the bollards behind the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=455.0s)]
*  federal building and taking the rocks, if you will, or pieces of concrete, and throwing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=459.6s)]

*  You know, it seems to me that the president really had two choices here. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=476.2s)]

*  And I already have said on this program, Pam, many times, that Mayorkas, Kamala Harris, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=500.72s)]

*  gang members, how do we find them all and get rid of them all? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  And why are Democrats putting their so-called rights above the safety of their own citizens? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=532.76s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=537.88s)]
*  Yeah, and Sean, the police chief also said in that press conference, the feds don't mess [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=538.88s)]
*  around and he's right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  Secretary Noem, Secretary Hegseth, Stephen Miller and I were with President Trump today [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=546.88s)]
*  in the Oval Office. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  We were talking about this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=552.68s)]
*  We were discussing this and we are lockstep together in protecting our citizens and getting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=553.88s)]
*  these illegal aliens and these criminals out of our country. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=560.96s)]
*  They think they can run to California and hide from the law. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=565.84s)]
*  You've seen all the violent offenders that have been arrested in California. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=569.6s)]

*  President Trump gave us a very clear directive, make America safe again. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=582.2s)]
*  And that's what we're doing, not just for California, but for all Americans. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=586.44s)]
*  And we are going to continue to do that and protect our great country and especially the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=591.08s)]
*  men and women in uniform who go out every single day to keep us safe. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebeHhzh_w4&t=597.9200000000001s)]
