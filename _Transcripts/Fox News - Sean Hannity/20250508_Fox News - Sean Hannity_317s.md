# Ted Cruz: The Biden-Harris record was radical, extreme and a failure
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c)
*  Senator Ted Cruz, Senator, you know, you look at the priority list. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to hear from Sean Duffy and he'll be on this program tomorrow night. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=3.68s)]
*  We're down thousands of air traffic controllers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=7.76s)]
*  We see the mess in the skies and they've got woke, you know, program after program, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  climate regulation after climate regulation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=17.44s)]
*  They didn't get one person on broadband with all those billions, not one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  How about Starlink? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=24.6s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, it was a radical administration that accomplished very little and what they [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=28.48s)]
*  did accomplish was harmful. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=33.36s)]
*  You know, as I watch Joe Biden's interview, he did say something right. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=34.8s)]
*  He said it wouldn't have made a difference if he'd stepped down earlier. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=38.72s)]
*  And I agree with that, whether he stepped down when he did or earlier, they would have [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=41.88s)]
*  lost and they would have lost because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's and the Democrats [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=46.44s)]
*  record was radical. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=50.6s)]
*  It was extreme and it was a failure. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=52.68s)]
*  When you open up our southern border to 12 million people invading this country, when [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=55.48s)]
*  you let in murderers and rapists and child molesters, when you say to every gang member [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=59.8s)]
*  in the world, come to America and kill Americans, when you say to terrorists, we have an open [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  red carpet for you on our southern border, the American people have a way of rejecting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=73.4s)]
*  When you attack American energy and oil and gas and drive up prices and drive up inflation, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=74.4s)]
*  the American people have a way of rejecting that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=79.06s)]
*  And when you engage in a radical record, look, Pete Buttigieg, he didn't focus on actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=81.08s)]
*  building roads and bridges. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=86.6s)]
*  As you pointed out, he had $42 billion to connect broadband in America. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=87.84s)]
*  He connected zero, nothing when it comes to his actual job. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=92.6s)]
*  Things like keeping the flying public safe, air traffic controllers, our air traffic control [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=97.68s)]
*  system is so old and antiquated is literally 1950s technology. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=102.72s)]
*  They use radars, they use little slips of paper and they use floppy disks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=108.88s)]
*  I guarantee you everyone under 30 watching this show doesn't know what a floppy disk [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=113.52s)]
*  is because they didn't exist. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=118.08s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  They use a floppy disk? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  You're kidding me, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=124.6s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=125.6s)]
*  I am not kidding. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=126.6s)]
*  The computers that we use for air traffic control. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=127.6s)]
*  I don't know if they're the five, that's actually a good question, whether the five inch or [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=132.4s)]
*  three inch, but it's floppy disk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=135.82s)]
*  The computers are the equivalent of a Commodore 64. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=137.84s)]
*  They actually, so I talked with Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=141.28s)]
*  They have to buy the parts to update our air traffic control system from eBay because they [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=145.68s)]
*  don't make them anymore. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=151.88s)]
*  They're 30, 40, 50 years old. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=152.88s)]
*  Now the Trump administration, they're leaning in. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=155.2s)]
*  We're going to invest real money and I've been fighting for a decade to modernize our [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=157.8s)]
*  air traffic control system. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=162.16s)]
*  But sadly, the Biden administration was completely AWOL on this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=163.76s)]
*  Okay, the border, the economy, war in Europe or in the Middle East. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=167.76s)]
*  You juxtapose all of that Senator to where they were spending money and where they were [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=174.04s)]
*  focusing their attention. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  In America, they were focusing their attention on DEI. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=180.92s)]
*  They were focusing their attention on wokeness. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=183.76s)]
*  They were focusing their attention on regulations. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Then they were spending hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, new green deal, wokeism, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=193.24s)]
*  transgenderism, LGBTQism. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=198.68s)]
*  I mean, I just, I can't even believe in many ways we survived it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=201.24s)]
*  And now to undo this mess, the only thing they have for Donald Trump is their criticism. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=206.88s)]
*  And it all happened on their watch. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=212.44s)]
*  And I don't think, I don't want to relitigate the election, but wow. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=214.32s)]
*  I mean, it's breathtaking how out of touch they are with their own failed record. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  Look, there was a level of corruption and a level of incompetence that is staggering. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=225.44s)]
*  The corruption, they weaponized every branch of the federal government, the Department [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  of Justice and the FBI. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=233.48s)]
*  They attacked their opponents, including indicting Donald Trump four times because they were [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=235.12s)]
*  terrified the voters would reelect him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, I just covered in my podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz, I just covered a story out [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  of USAID about a Biden administration official who funneled massive amounts of money to a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=245.64s)]
*  crony of his in Africa, who in turn wired money back to him, utterly corrupt payoffs. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=252.6s)]
*  And by the way, when Doe showed up to say, show us the books, he blocked the doors and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  said, no, you can't see the books. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=264.88s)]
*  That level of corruption. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  Look, I interviewed again on my podcast, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  He described how in the closing months of the Biden administration, they spent $20 billion. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=275.08s)]
*  Here's how the Biden administration described it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  Throwing gold bars out the window. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=285.08s)]
*  That included $2 billion to a nonprofit that employed Stacey Abrams to just, it was utter [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=287.52s)]
*  corruption. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=293.96s)]
*  And so that's a big part of the election. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=294.96s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons I'm really excited about the Trump administration, because they're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  changing that and turning it around. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  All right, Senator Cruz, we appreciate your time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBxCb1YN38c&t=303.0s)]
