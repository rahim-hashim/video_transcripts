# Hannity: America is done being ripped off
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU)
*  And welcome to Hannity, and we are loaded up tonight with a ton of news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=0.0s)]
*  It is Liberation Day in America, and tonight we will shatter the myths surrounding Donald [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=4.94s)]
*  Trump's American first economic vision and something called reciprocal tariffs that are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=11.06s)]
*  well-earned by other countries. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=16.78s)]
*  We'll also shine a bright light on the Democratic Party, which has no vision at all whatsoever, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=18.14s)]
*  as we all know by now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=24.7s)]
*  They do really hate insurrections. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=26.02s)]
*  They value democracy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=28.060000000000002s)]
*  That's what they say until, of course, they lose an election. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  And then the radical left, well, they're completely silent on domestic terrorism, the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  same Democrats who feigned outrage for years over January 6th. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=37.3s)]
*  And now they're perfectly fine with terrorism against Teslas, Tesla dealerships, charging [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=41.66s)]
*  stations, and they revere an alleged cold-blooded killer named Luigi Mangione. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=47.06s)]
*  Wait till you hear tonight's update. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=53.68s)]
*  Also coming up. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=55.42s)]
*  And in the other, our Other News of the Day segment, Alec Baldwin, the king of hate and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=57.0s)]
*  rage himself, is once again in a state of hysteria. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=62.14s)]
*  We've got the tape to prove it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=65.5s)]
*  And also Ron Klain, really? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=67.28s)]
*  Joe Biden's loyal chief of staff now stabbing his boss in the back. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=69.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=74.78s)]
*  Also tonight, a dangerous storm is ripping through the South and the Midwest. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=75.78s)]
*  It is causing flash floods, massive tornadoes, as you can see there on your screen. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=79.5s)]
*  We will have live coverage throughout the night. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=85.92s)]
*  Our prayers are with the people in that area. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=88.12s)]
*  But we begin with the beautiful White House Rose Garden, where President Trump earlier [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=90.54s)]
*  today ushered in a new era of American prosperity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=95.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=98.68s)]
*  April 2nd, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=99.68s)]
*  day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=107.76s)]
*  again. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=115.04s)]
*  For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=116.04s)]
*  near and far, both friend and foe alike. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=121.64s)]
*  American steelworkers, auto workers, farmers, and skilled craftsmen, we have a lot of them [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=126.0s)]
*  here with us today. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  They really suffered gravely. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=132.70000000000002s)]
*  They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=134.74s)]
*  ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=140.5s)]
*  dream. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  going to happen anymore. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=155.5s)]
*  This is one of the most important days, in my opinion, in American history. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  It's our Declaration of Economic Independence. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=163.98s)]
*  For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=167.72s)]
*  got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=173.32s)]
*  But now it's our turn to prosper and in so doing use trillions and trillions of dollars [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=183.72s)]
*  If you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=189.54s)]
*  America because there is no tariff if you build your plant, your product in America. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  All of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors, and everyone else [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs, I say terminate your own [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=204.94s)]
*  tariffs, drop your barriers, don't manipulate your currencies. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=211.38s)]
*  They manipulate their currencies like nobody can even believe, which is a bad, bad thing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=215.7s)]
*  and very devastating to us, and start buying tens of billions of dollars of American goods. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=220.94s)]
*  And he said we can no longer unilaterally economically surrender. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=228.1s)]
*  Now let's be clear about one thing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=232.5s)]
*  We're supposed to be the land of the free, the home of the brave, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=234.04s)]
*  America didn't just magically become the single greatest country God ever gave man by allowing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=238.22s)]
*  other countries to walk all over us, rip us off and take advantage of us. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=244.82s)]
*  And now thanks to President Trump, well, the world's free ride is now over. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  Now free trade is a two-way street. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  The president wants free and fair trade, but they don't want free and fair trade. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=255.82s)]
*  While the U.S. imposed low or zero tariffs from products around the world, American exports [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=260.36s)]
*  were heavily taxed, throttled and even blocked altogether. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=266.34s)]
*  We have been ripped off by countries all over this world for decades, friends and foes [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=270.64s)]
*  alike. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=275.88s)]
*  Those days are thankfully now as of tonight over. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=276.88s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=280.86s)]
*  Here are the new reciprocal tariffs for each country around the world compared to the tariffs [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  that they already impose on our products, American products. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=287.52s)]
*  On the blue column, well, this is what American businesses faced when trying to enter a foreign [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=291.76s)]
*  nearly 40% tax from the European Union. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=298.84s)]
*  I thought they were our friends. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=301.4s)]
*  50% Japan, South Korea, India, 61% Switzerland, 72% Thailand, 64% Indonesia, Canada. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=302.88s)]
*  Absolutely screws our dairy farmers and our meat producers. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=313.32s)]
*  That's not very neighborly, if you ask me. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=318.84s)]
*  And the list will keep scrolling. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=320.88s)]
*  It goes on and on. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=322.52s)]
*  Make no mistakes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  These are massive, massive taxes and markups designed to make American products uncompetitive. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=325.66s)]
*  They're hurting our ranchers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=332.72s)]
*  They're hurting our farmers. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=333.94s)]
*  They're hurting our manufacturers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=335.18s)]
*  They're hurting our auto industry. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=337.14000000000004s)]
*  Look, for example, the top of the list, China's tariff against American imports, it's 64%. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=338.82000000000005s)]
*  That's not free and fair trade. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=345.98s)]
*  And by the way, how is this fair in any way? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=348.06s)]
*  Why are we making China and all these other countries rich? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=350.54s)]
*  We can make all of these products here in America. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=354.1s)]
*  And don't you want a president that's advocating for and defending American workers, American [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=357.38s)]
*  businesses, American products around the globe? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=363.54s)]
*  All these countries want access to the, what, 360 million Americans. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=366.22s)]
*  They want access to our markets so they can make more money. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, spare me all the hand wringing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=374.62s)]
*  Well, what about Canada and the European Union? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=377.38s)]
*  They're our friends. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  We spend a trillion dollars a year, your money, to protect them from worldwide threats. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=381.9s)]
*  We eclipse all of their NATO spending combined. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=388.88s)]
*  We spend billions in research, development on state of the art weapons that they end [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=392.76s)]
*  up using. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=398.02s)]
*  We provide that to them. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=399.46s)]
*  When Ukraine was attacked, we provided the majority of the funding and the weapons to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=401.38s)]
*  fight back against Russia. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of your dollars. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=408.38s)]
*  Some of us suspect that if spy balloon was over Canada, it was American planes that shot [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=411.06s)]
*  it down. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=414.78s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=415.78s)]
*  Because Canada's aging planes, they couldn't get altitude high enough. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=416.78s)]
*  And just recently, when European trade routes were blocked off by the hooty rebels, well, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  we were the ones that delivered a massive blow to Iran's proxy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=425.82s)]
*  It looks like we might be giving another one. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=429.41999999999996s)]
*  And it's not just defense that we're providing. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  Here's one of the reasons why our health care costs are so high. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  The U.S. develops almost all new drugs, all new medical technology, all at a massive cost, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=438.74s)]
*  while other countries, with socialized medicine, they steal it, they hand it out for free, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=444.98s)]
*  and you pay full price. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=450.66s)]
*  That sound fair? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=452.24s)]
*  But it's somehow wrong to tax these countries that are putting massive taxes, tariffs on [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=453.38s)]
*  us, the EU, Canada. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=460.58s)]
*  What, we're supposed to just take this? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  At some point, this free ride must end. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=465.1s)]
*  It's ending. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=467.42s)]
*  We should never get a free ride forever. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=469.1s)]
*  But the good news, once and for all, to our international friends, there are two ways [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  to make these tariffs go away. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=475.66s)]
*  One, end the tariffs on our products. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  That's free and fair trade. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=479.66s)]
*  Two, make your products in the United States, like Hyundai's doing, Mercedes is doing, BMW, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=481.14000000000004s)]
*  Toyota, Nissan. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=486.46000000000004s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  There are many other massive companies that are now making products right here in America, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=489.5s)]
*  getting Americans high-paying career jobs, and they're setting up shop in the near future. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=494.3s)]
*  Even Rolls-Royce is thinking about building engines here. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=500.7s)]
*  To put it bluntly, those are jobs for you, the American people, for the hardworking Americans, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=503.58s)]
*  for the people that make this country great and a more competitive product with zero tariffs. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  And of course, Democrats, the legacy media mob, they're totally distraught, as usual. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  If the dog bites, the bee stings, you're feeling sad, you blame Trump. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=521.5799999999999s)]
*  And the New York Times actually published a sob story about a Chinese factory owner [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=525.66s)]
*  whose business is now quieter than it should be. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=531.78s)]
*  That's complete Adam Bull-shif. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=535.74s)]
*  I said it the right way. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=538.3s)]
*  And meanwhile, Hakeem Jeffries is all but rooting for a recession. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=539.5799999999999s)]
*  Listen. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=543.98s)]
*  Republicans are crashing the American economy in real time and driving us to a recession. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  This is not Liberation Day. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=555.4200000000001s)]
*  It's Recession Day in the United States of America. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=557.86s)]
*  Cheering for failure, the party that once at least pretended to care about Americans [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=563.98s)]
*  and American workers while also ignoring inflation for four years, now suddenly uninterested [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=569.22s)]
*  in American jobs while deeply concerned with the costs of foreign goods. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=574.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=579.5s)]
*  He argued in a White House setting that this is a good thing for the United States. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=580.5s)]
*  Called it even at one point a rose garden type celebration, many others view it differently. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  And many sectors of our economy are bracing for an impact that has been universally described [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=591.7s)]
*  as likely negative for you, a regular consumer or taxpayer. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=596.32s)]
*  Trump is risking a recession with this national sales tax. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=601.78s)]
*  He calls tariffs. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=605.3399999999999s)]
*  Tariffs are just another tax, which is very regressive. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=606.3399999999999s)]
*  It's just a sales tax. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  It's now official. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=612.5s)]
*  The Democratic Party, the legacy media mob, they no longer represent the hardworking men [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=613.5s)]
*  and women in this country that make this country great. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=619.06s)]
*  It is a party that is filled to the brim with coastal elites in San Francisco, L.A., New [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=621.88s)]
*  York, D.C., Illinois. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=627.78s)]
*  We'll include them. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=629.98s)]
*  By the way, people that likely never got their hands dirty have never seen the inside of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=631.52s)]
*  a factory. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=635.9599999999999s)]
*  Most of them probably don't even know how to use a lawnmower, much less sharpen the [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  blades. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=641.8s)]
*  But maybe, just maybe, they'd be willing to just, you know, maybe listen to even Biden's [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=642.8s)]
*  Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, who had this to say about the impact of tariffs on the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=648.68s)]
*  American consumer, the opposite of what Democrats are saying now. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=654.68s)]
*  And there have been some experts, some groups, the National Retail Federation among them, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=659.08s)]
*  who have expressed concerns that it will be U.S. consumers who eventually end up paying [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=663.48s)]
*  for these tariffs. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=668.68s)]
*  As you know, polling shows that rising prices are voters' biggest concern right now. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=669.68s)]
*  So I'd ask you to speak directly to them. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=673.8s)]
*  Will American consumers bear the cost of these tariffs? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=676.04s)]
*  I don't believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=680.32s)]
*  that they face. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=687.7199999999999s)]
*  For once, Yellen was right. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=690.12s)]
*  But this is about more than prices for consumers. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=691.9599999999999s)]
*  Papu Cannon pointed out in 2019, quote, tariffs are the taxes that made America great. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=695.88s)]
*  The Tariff Act, signed into law by George Washington in 1789, protected American manufacturers. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  It created a new, thriving industrial sector in the Northeast in this country. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  The Founding Fathers also enacted the Tariff of 1816. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=713.8599999999999s)]
*  That allowed Americans to generate its own textile market, all but blocking out competition [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=717.68s)]
*  from Great Britain. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=723.08s)]
*  And in the early 1900s, a new tariff allowed multiple presidents to slash income taxes, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=724.48s)]
*  which ignited the roaring 20s. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=730.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff is always blamed by the left for the Great [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=732.76s)]
*  Depression. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=738.28s)]
*  One problem, the stock market crashed well before the tariff became law. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=739.28s)]
*  And as Buchanan pointed out, mismanagement from the Federal Reserve was the real villain [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=743.88s)]
*  of the Great Depression and not a tariff that wasn't even in effect. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  And remember this, according to Buchanan, a tariff is a tax, but its purpose is not [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=753.2s)]
*  just to raise revenue, but to make a nation economically independent of others and to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  bring its citizens to rely upon each other rather than foreign entities. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=764.12s)]
*  Let me sum it up. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=769.5600000000001s)]
*  America first. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=770.84s)]
*  That is exactly why today is Liberation Day. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=771.84s)]
*  It's a day that will be remembered as a turning point and the start, I hope, for every American [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=775.08s)]
*  of a new golden age of American wealth and exceptionalism. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV-tzzogSBU&t=780.36s)]
