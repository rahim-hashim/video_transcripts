# It’s clear whose side Democrats are on, says Sen. Katie Britt
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU)
*  Here with reaction now is Alabama Senator Katie Brick. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=0.0s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=3.7s)]
*  So where should we start? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=4.7s)]
*  Should we start with the Democrats protesting in New Jersey? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=5.7s)]
*  I think there are too many things to talk about, honestly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  I mean, why is it that they're outside this ICE facility demanding, you know, they said [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=10.82s)]
*  they were on a tour, they were just there to do oversight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=15.42s)]
*  But this facility, of course, houses the worst of the worst convicted murderers, child predators, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=18.46s)]
*  child pornographers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=23.3s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=24.3s)]
*  And yet these are the people Democrats are taking the time to try and go protect and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=25.5s)]
*  getting arrested for. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=30.2s)]
*  It's clear whose side Democrats are on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=32.36s)]
*  They're on the side of child molesters, on gang members, on those who are preying on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=34.8s)]
*  the most vulnerable and here illegally. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=39.72s)]
*  And Republicans have the backs of the American people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know where this passion was from the Democrats over the last four years as we saw [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=46.04s)]
*  our border be invaded day after day after day. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=50.92s)]
*  As we saw the heartbreaking stories of people like Laken Reilly losing her life or Rachel [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  Moran or Jocelyn Nungery. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=60.34s)]
*  Or as you talk to parents from coast to coast, Katie, who lost their children to fentanyl poisoning. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=62.540000000000006s)]
*  Where was this energy? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=67.88s)]
*  Where was this fight? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, they don't have that fight for the American people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=70.26s)]
*  But President Trump made a commitment over the last four years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  There was no more litigated issue, Katie, than this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  Our wide open borders and the failed policies of the Biden administration and of Democrats [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=78.94s)]
*  who were in charge. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  And he has said, enough's enough. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=85.74s)]
*  We are securing our border and we are making sure that Americans are safe in their communities [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=87.58s)]
*  and in their homes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=92.06s)]
*  But that number of the 93 percent drop in border crossings is incredible. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=93.06s)]
*  Oh, it's incredible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  It just proves that where there was a will, there was a way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  And Democrats didn't have it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=100.86s)]
*  And Katie, do you not remember Democrats told us the only way that they could close the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=102.22s)]
*  wide open border was through legislation, a bipartisan piece of legislation that was [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=106.06s)]
*  simply false. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=111.02s)]
*  It was all about will. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=112.74s)]
*  It was all about purpose. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=114.14s)]
*  And it was whose back do you have? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=115.7s)]
*  It's clear Republicans and President Trump have the backs of the American people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=117.06s)]
*  And Senate Democrats continue to have the backs of those here illegally. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=120.66000000000001s)]
*  Well, it wasn't just any legislation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=124.22s)]
*  They demanded these big pieces of legislation that gave amnesty to the millions of people [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=126.2s)]
*  who came into the country illegally, including criminal aliens who had criminal histories [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=130.88s)]
*  in their home countries. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=135.86s)]
*  So there was an agenda there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=137.06s)]
*  It wasn't just a matter of getting something done. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=138.66s)]
*  And Katie, also think about those who have preyed on the most vulnerable. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=140.86s)]
*  So you mentioned the numbers about the border being down 93 percent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=144.0s)]
*  Let's talk about unaccompanied children who were allowed to come here under the Biden [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=146.92s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=150.04s)]
*  You go back to March of 21, 18,000 unaccompanied children in March of 21. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=151.04s)]
*  This past March, we had 600, just over 600 unaccompanied children. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Those numbers have gone down dramatically. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=161.72s)]
*  But also, what did Democrats do for those unaccompanied children who were being trafficked [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=164.06s)]
*  or abused throughout our interior? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=168.44s)]
*  And the answer is they didn't ask for questions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=171.32s)]
*  They didn't ask for hearings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=173.22s)]
*  They didn't they didn't fight for those kids in the way that they're fighting for these [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  illegal criminal aliens now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=178.38s)]
*  So when the unaccompanied minor number goes down, that means that the human trafficking [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=180.98s)]
*  numbers are also going down. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  So on Capitol Hill, you're still dealing with this issue. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  The president has tried to implement a number of policies that allow people to self deport. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=189.28s)]
*  As you saw, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bond, you know, is warning people if you're here, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  get out. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  Chris, you know, the DHS secretary has also said that while they argue that we're playing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  Russian roulette with people's lives, these Democrats who are defending, keeping these [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=203.8s)]
*  criminal aliens who have murdered in communities before here and not wanting them to be deported. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=207.28s)]
*  Democrats trying to turn around deportation planes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=213.4s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat, flying down to El Salvador, meeting with a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=217.0s)]
*  wife-beating gang member who was deported out of the country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  So where do you guys go from here to try and get this underway? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=226.6s)]
*  Because there were millions of people let into the country, mostly all of them unvetted. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=229.84s)]
*  And when you talk to a lot of these Border Patrol, HSI ICE officials, they will tell [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=234.54s)]
*  you, look, there's a lot of bad people who are in the country and we're going out every [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=239.5s)]
*  day trying to get them out. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=243.26s)]
*  But we're getting pushback from Democrats and the numbers are just so overwhelming. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=244.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=248.42s)]
*  Well, first off, it is a new day in America with President Trump in charge and with Republicans [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=249.42s)]
*  in charge of the House and the Senate. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  We have the backs of our law enforcement officers. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=254.58s)]
*  We appreciate the work that CBP does. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=257.16s)]
*  We appreciate the work that the men and women of ICE does. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=259.22s)]
*  And we're going to support that not only with our words, but making sure they have the proper [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=262.04s)]
*  funding to do the job that they took an oath to do and keep Americans safe. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  So we're about to go through reconciliation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=270.48s)]
*  One of the things that we'll be looking to do is to make sure those resources are in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=272.8s)]
*  the right place. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=276.2s)]
*  I mean, you look at something like our non-detained docket. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=277.2s)]
*  This is yet another mismanagement of Joe Biden. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  He had what? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=281.9s)]
*  Over three million non-detained by the time President Trump came back in. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=282.9s)]
*  It's over 7.8 million in the non-detained docket. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=286.35999999999996s)]
*  Over 105 percent increase. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  There are people, about 1.5 million of those, who have been given their due process and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  have their final orders of removal. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=296.14s)]
*  And they want them to stay. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=297.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=298.64s)]
*  And removing those individuals is going to be a priority. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=299.64s)]
*  We made a commitment to the American people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=301.7s)]
*  And the Democrats seem to be lost back into the America last policies that actually lost [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=304.08s)]
*  them this election. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=309.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=310.28s)]
*  We're committed to making sure that Americans are safe and secure. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  We're going to make sure law enforcement and we only not only have their back, but they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=313.9s)]
*  have their resources. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=316.4s)]
*  And we're going to use every tool in our toolbox to make the interior of the United States [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=317.78s)]
*  of America safe again. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=321.5s)]
*  And it's an honor to be a part of it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=323.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, it seems to be that Democrats aren't lost, that they actually have an anti-American [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=324.9s)]
*  agenda to keep these criminal aliens here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=328.46s)]
*  And when they're being detained and put into ICE immigration centers, they want to break [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=331.26s)]
*  in and then cause a scene for political reasons. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=334.76s)]
*  So we will see if another protest breaks out. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  And we will see if the mayor receives charges for the things that were alleged against him [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=340.32s)]
*  at that facility. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=345.16s)]
*  So we will be watching. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLuC3Rqt7iU&t=346.16s)]
