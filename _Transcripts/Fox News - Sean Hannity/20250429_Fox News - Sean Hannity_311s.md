# Trump has achieved more in the first 100 days than presidents do in a lifetime, House speaker says
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE)
*  As we continue our coverage of Trump's 100 days of political shock and awe, we are doing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=0.0s)]
*  things a little bit differently from those in the left-wing legacy media mob, who, according [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=7.36s)]
*  to one analysis, they spent 92 percent of their time casting Trump and his agenda in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=11.76s)]
*  a negative light. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=17.0s)]
*  No surprise there. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=18.26s)]
*  But that leaves it to us to tell you that President Trump has actually been extremely [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=19.86s)]
*  effective in these first 100 days. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=23.7s)]
*  In fact, the House Speaker, Mike Johnson, tells Fox News Digital that the president [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=25.84s)]
*  has accomplished more in the first 100 days of his tenure than most politicians or presidents [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=30.6s)]
*  will accomplish in their entire terms. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=36.3s)]
*  Here with more, Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson is with us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=38.68s)]
*  You know, I think the president has summed it up pretty well tonight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=41.68s)]
*  Main Street, not Wall Street, protect the middle class, not the political class. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=44.72s)]
*  The Republican Party really now has become the party of working men and women, and I [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=49.24s)]
*  view the Democratic Party as the party of radical extremist coastal elites that are [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=53.4s)]
*  just completely out of touch, as evidenced by Chuck Schumer's 17 percent approval rating [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=59.12s)]
*  and Democrats in general in the 20s. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=64.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right, Sean. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=66.92s)]
*  We had a great day on Capitol Hill celebrating the first 100 days. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=69.44s)]
*  We summarize it in four simple words, promises made, promises kept. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=73.88s)]
*  All that negative coverage by the mainstream media has not affected President Trump's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=77.88s)]
*  performance because he got elected to perform and do a job and he is doing it in spades. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=81.96s)]
*  And what I said was, I think he's achieved more in the first 100 days than most presidents [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=86.72s)]
*  do in a lifetime. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=90.36s)]
*  I think it's objectively a fact. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=91.36s)]
*  You can you can show it in every metric, everything he's done. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=92.92s)]
*  So many executive orders, so many bold actions taken from the White House, restoring America's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=96.56s)]
*  strength on the world stage, getting rid of the policies and crazy regulations of the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=101.28s)]
*  Biden administration, unwinding the mess. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=106.96s)]
*  He's off to a great start and we are just getting started. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  And that's why we're also excited to deliver on the rest of the Trump agenda. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=111.84s)]
*  You think about the securing our borders, getting rid and deporting illegal immigrants, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=115.72s)]
*  eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, moving towards energy dominance, trying to trying [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=120.2s)]
*  to find a way, thread the needle and get peace in Europe, peace in the Middle East, rebuild [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  our military, make it safer at home and abroad for Americans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=129.24s)]
*  These are all big agenda items. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=134.72s)]
*  There's nothing small about what he's trying to accomplish here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=136.64s)]
*  Now the issue, we're just talking to the majority leader. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=140.04s)]
*  Where do you stand on this bill? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=143.04s)]
*  There's one big, beautiful bill. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=144.88s)]
*  I understand July 4th is the target date, but you have a small majority. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=146.84s)]
*  Where do you stand with members? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=151.64s)]
*  You're talking to them every day because I know there are different views. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=153.0s)]
*  Yeah, there are different views, of course, but we're right on schedule and right on [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  target. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=160.72s)]
*  We're moving this very aggressively because we have to. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=161.72s)]
*  We've got to deliver for the American people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=163.96s)]
*  The one big, beautiful bill has so many components. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  All of it is necessary. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=168.88s)]
*  All of it is important and all of it is timely. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=169.88s)]
*  So, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Besson said yesterday that July 4th would be great [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=171.72s)]
*  to celebrate all the tax cuts and all the other achievements by then. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  I'd like to do it sooner, Sean. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=180.52s)]
*  So the latest, the update is, I'm sure the leader told you, we've got seven committees [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=182.28s)]
*  doing markups of their various pieces of legislation this week. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=186.56s)]
*  We'll have four other committees in the House doing that same work next week. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=190.0s)]
*  The third week, we'll have the budget committee merge all that together into one big, beautiful [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=193.84s)]
*  bill and we'll send that over to the Senate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=198.52s)]
*  We want to move this aggressively because it will stabilize the markets. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=200.68s)]
*  It will be a turbo boost to the economy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  It will restore, again, helping us restore the peace through strength principle. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=206.12s)]
*  And it will show the country that Republicans are serious, that they made the right choice. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=210.28s)]
*  We had a demographic shift in the 2024 election, as you know. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  New voters, new categories of folks who joined the party. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=217.82000000000002s)]
*  We're going to demonstrate for them they made the right choice and they're going to stay [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  with us and we're going to fix this country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=223.0s)]
*  Do you have any worries, any concerns at all that factions might split off? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=225.4s)]
*  Are you are you confident that the members will understand they're not going to get [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=229.8s)]
*  everything that they want, that they have to work within the confines of the reconciliation [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=233.0s)]
*  process established in the Senate? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=238.08s)]
*  And that can be restrictive. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, every one of the House Republicans are committed to delivering for the people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=242.08s)]
*  And we have different preferences and ideas, but that's kind of the beauty of the process. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=246.8s)]
*  We're working together as one team. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=250.44s)]
*  And I'll note as well, the House and Senate Republicans are working together seamlessly [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  as one team. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=256.36s)]
*  I know that's an innovation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=257.36s)]
*  I know it doesn't happen a lot in Washington, but we understand the stakes are so high and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=258.36s)]
*  we cannot fail in the mission. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=261.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=263.44s)]
*  So we're meeting constantly. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=264.44s)]
*  We're coordinating. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=265.44s)]
*  That's going to be the secret to this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=266.44s)]
*  And President Trump is a hands on leader. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=267.56s)]
*  One of the things we're celebrating this first hundred days is his direct involvement in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=273.76s)]
*  I mean, he's the most consequential leader, the Atlantic magazine, which is no fan of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=274.76s)]
*  the president. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you mentioned it yet tonight, but they described him yesterday as one of the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  most, I think they said he's the most powerful leader of the 21st century. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=282.76s)]
*  That's a publication that's not a fan of his. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=288.72s)]
*  It's true. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  And he's going to deliver this and we're going to make it happen for the people. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, we'll be following closely. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=295.48s)]
*  It's too important. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=297.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxCFEZGcGQE&t=298.32s)]
