# Senate Majority Leader Thune: The stakes are too high
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0)
*  There are senators, I won't mention names, that kind of have contempt for President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=0.0s)]
*  They want to be opposition voices, and they don't really understand how profound and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=4.48s)]
*  deep this moment is. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=9.4s)]
*  Anyway, we'll see over time what happens with some of these other senators. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=11.16s)]
*  So the road ahead is not going to be easy, but so far, Senate leadership, they have done [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=15.72s)]
*  an amazing job. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=20.2s)]
*  They have stuck together. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=21.64s)]
*  They have navigated challenge after challenge. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=22.84s)]
*  They got the president's cabinet through. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  I'm here with Moore. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=27.88s)]
*  We'll start tonight with Senate Majority Leader John Thune. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=28.88s)]
*  Senator, good to see you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=31.08s)]
*  Good to see you, Sean. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=32.08s)]
*  Welcome to the Capitol. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=33.08s)]
*  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=34.08s)]
*  As you call it, the swamp. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=35.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=36.08s)]
*  I call it the swamp. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=37.08s)]
*  But, you know, things are working a little bit differently right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=38.08s)]
*  You were able to get everyone united, to get the president's cabinet through, not a small [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=41.8s)]
*  task. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=47.4s)]
*  You didn't shut the Senate down. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=48.4s)]
*  You kept it open for hour after hour after hour. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=49.6s)]
*  Senator Kennedy wanted to go home and have a beer. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=52.46s)]
*  What's that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=57.76s)]
*  Or two. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=58.76s)]
*  Or two. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=59.76s)]
*  Or three. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=60.76s)]
*  So kudos to you for that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=61.76s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham was on my show the other night, said something that's really profound [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=65.8s)]
*  in my view. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  In the last hundred years, there's only been four times that Republicans have had control [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=71.52s)]
*  of the White House, the House and the Senate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=78.8s)]
*  This is such a historic opportunity. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=81.8s)]
*  And maybe it only lasts two years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=84.6s)]
*  Tell us what the next steps are. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=89.0s)]
*  Well, first off, thanks, Sean, and thanks to this team and our fellow Senate Republicans. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=90.0s)]
*  We did get the president's cabinet in place the fastest rate in 20 years. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=95.08s)]
*  We were in session for 10 consecutive weeks for the first time in 15 years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  And today we have cast more votes than any Senate going back to the Reagan administration. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=104.56s)]
*  So people are showing up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  They're doing the work. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=111.52s)]
*  And we have a lot more work ahead of us. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=113.44s)]
*  But if you look at what's at stake, the stakes are high, as you pointed out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=114.44s)]
*  We don't get this opportunity very often. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=117.8s)]
*  And when it comes along, sometimes it doesn't last very long. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=119.6s)]
*  So we've got to make the most of these two years where we've got President Trump's leadership [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=121.88s)]
*  in the White House. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=126.16s)]
*  And, boy, isn't that a welcome relief from the past four years, working with Republican [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=127.16s)]
*  Senate and Republican House to do the things the president campaigned on. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=131.96s)]
*  And that's to secure the border, make a generational investment in doing that, make sure that we're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=135.8s)]
*  investing in our national security so we're prepared for whatever threats exist around [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  the world, avoiding a $4 trillion tax increase at the end of this year, preventing that from [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  happening, and then restoring American energy dominance. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=149.44s)]
*  Those are all priorities the president campaigned on. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=152.8s)]
*  And I would add, deficit reduction. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  We have got to cut spending. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=157.8s)]
*  And that's a priority for this Senate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=159.36s)]
*  I'd add, too, the next generation of weaponry. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=160.84s)]
*  We live in a dangerous world. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=163.3s)]
*  We do, indeed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  So Senator Graham is the head of the Budget Committee. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  And Senator Graham also said on that show that he was on that, as the head of the Budget [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=169.68s)]
*  Committee, he can bypass the Senate parliamentarian. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=174.72s)]
*  Look, to explain reconciliation to hardworking Americans that get up every day, work hard, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=178.68s)]
*  play by the rules gets a little bit complicated. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=184.68s)]
*  But the reality is, in your body, in the Senate, where you're the majority leader, it gets [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=187.16s)]
*  complicated. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=192.28s)]
*  And it's not as complicated in the House. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a procedure by which you have very strict rules and regulations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=195.84s)]
*  Then you've got to come together with the House. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=199.76s)]
*  You guys got to strike a deal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=201.48s)]
*  Explain it in maybe layman's terms so people that are busy providing for their families [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=204.36s)]
*  every day can really understand why this is important. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=209.76s)]
*  Well, and you're right. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=212.08s)]
*  It is the quintessential, if you will, Washington inside baseball game. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=213.56s)]
*  And even the language around it is complicated. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=218.74s)]
*  But the short of it is, we believe, and in the Senate at least, when you have unified [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=222.14s)]
*  control of government, House, Senate and White House, which as you pointed out, we've had [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=225.66s)]
*  a half a dozen less than that times in the last century, you can do things at 51 votes [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=229.17999999999998s)]
*  in the Senate that would otherwise require 60. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=234.42s)]
*  But you got to have maximum cooperation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=237.1s)]
*  You got to have 51 Senate Republicans to hang together. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=238.94s)]
*  You got to have 218 members of the House. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  And you got to have a president who's willing to sign a bill into law. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=243.76s)]
*  We have all those things in place. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=246.77999999999997s)]
*  And Lindsey has done a great job as the chairman of the Budget Committee. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=249.2s)]
*  And we believe the law is very clear, that he has the authority to set what that baseline [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  is. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  And there is a lot of conversation around which baseline you use. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  But the simple fact of the matter is, we believe that extending the tax relief that was passed [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=261.24s)]
*  in 2017 under President Trump ought to be able to be continued. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=266.24s)]
*  And that isn't something we ought to have to offset or pay for. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=270.4s)]
*  These are policies that are in place. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=273.28s)]
*  Tax rates should stay the same on January 1st of next year as they are on December 31st. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=275.4s)]
*  And as you pointed out in your leadoff to this, some of the other things that the president's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  trying to achieve to provide the American people with tax relief so they can keep more [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=284.0s)]
*  of their hard-earned dollars and spend them the way they want to spend them instead of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=288.76s)]
*  sending them to Washington, D.C. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=292.84s)]
*  So if you're not able, and you have a three-vote majority in the Senate, and I think we're [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=294.64s)]
*  up to seven now in the House, and so you have this arcane maneuver which, for example, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=299.44s)]
*  was used to pass Obamacare. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=305.28s)]
*  I believe it was used to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=307.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so it's been used in the past. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  And the Budget Committee Chair pulls that off. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  But you have a very small majority. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=316.67999999999995s)]
*  So you've got to work within the rules. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  You've got to get it passed in the Senate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=321.05999999999995s)]
*  And you've got to get the House to go along with it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=322.4s)]
*  They've got a small majority. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  I know everybody has whatever their priorities are. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=326.32s)]
*  Is everybody fully on board? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you have a good feeling that you're going to get the 50 votes, hopefully 51 or 52 or [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=332.64s)]
*  all 53? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Do you believe that the House, having had conversations with Speaker Johnson, you'll [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  get it done there, too? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, shame on us if we don't. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  This is historic in terms of the opportunity. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think what's going to motivate all those people, both in the House and the Senate, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=350.44s)]
*  Republicans, I can't think of a Republican that would abide a $4 trillion tax increase [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=354.76s)]
*  on the American people. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  And you're talking about $2.6 trillion of that tax increase falling on families that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=361.1s)]
*  make less than $400,000 a year, a $600 billion increase, tax increase on small businesses. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=365.3s)]
*  Those are the people that are out there working every day, Sean, and we need to make sure [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=371.74s)]
*  that we keep taxes low. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=374.62s)]
*  And as we move through this process, and it is, it's very complicated, especially in the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=377.70000000000005s)]
*  Senate. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  The rules are very prescriptive. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=382.34000000000003s)]
*  We have to thread a needle in order to get this done. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=383.66s)]
*  But we have to have maximum cooperation and support from every Senate Republican, every [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=387.34s)]
*  House Republican. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=391.9s)]
*  The stakes are too high, and this opportunity isn't going to come along very often. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=392.9s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=396.96s)]
*  I'll ask you, and then I'll ask the rest of the group. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=397.96s)]
*  You have a meeting that you have to run to, so we only have you for a few minutes. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  The issue of tariffs. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  Seems like a pretty simple concept to me. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=407.62s)]
*  We have countries, allied countries, we have friend and foe, putting high tariffs on American [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=409.82s)]
*  products, and much higher than we put on them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=416.18s)]
*  I believe that, frankly, they're ripping us off, as the president says. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=419.5s)]
*  And the president ran on that issue. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=424.86s)]
*  And I know there might be a little bit of disagreement, some nuance, some more profound. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=427.22s)]
*  But the idea that countries feel, especially countries that benefit from our military and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=432.54s)]
*  our defense capabilities, and the fact that they're tariffing their friend and their ally [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=438.94s)]
*  that they'll depend on one day, kind of is insulting to me as an American. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=444.26s)]
*  And I just want to know, where do you stand on the issue? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=449.97999999999996s)]
*  And do you think that the president's, obviously, $7 trillion in committed investments a lot. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=452.3s)]
*  Obviously 70-plus countries wanted to negotiate, got the world's attention. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=458.26s)]
*  How do you think this plays out? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=462.46s)]
*  Well, look, I think the president, everybody, we all heard it, he won 77 million votes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=463.62s)]
*  And there wasn't a day on the campaign trail where he didn't talk about tariffs. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=469.74s)]
*  It's something he believes in. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=473.36s)]
*  He deserves the opportunity to go get the deals he can get and to get the reciprocity [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  that we need with some of these countries that have been taking advantage of us. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=481.96s)]
*  And so this is the, you know, I think most of us up here believe that he deserves that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=485.4s)]
*  opportunity. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  And he and his administration are working very aggressively, as you know, and have already [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  announced, you know, so many countries have come to the table, are looking for deals. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=495.74s)]
*  So let's give this president some space to see what he can get done. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=500.20000000000005s)]
*  And obviously we're all paying close attention to it, but we think that he campaigned on [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=503.8s)]
*  it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  He made it very clear to the American people what he wanted to achieve in doing it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think when it comes to creating better paying jobs in this country and growing our [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=513.1600000000001s)]
*  economy, making America stronger and getting investment in this country, you're already [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=516.88s)]
*  seeing some of that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=521.38s)]
*  Some of these supply chains are coming back home. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=522.44s)]
*  Let's give this president an opportunity to see what he can get done. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=524.72s)]
*  Majority Leader Thune. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=527.28s)]
*  I would stretch, but if I do, all these wires are going to come falling off me. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=533.36s)]
*  We appreciate you letting us do this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=534.36s)]
*  And it's a unique opportunity. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=535.72s)]
*  I know senators don't often like to do group interviews, so I'm very appreciative of all [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=537.4s)]
*  of you and we thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  Senator Britt, let me start with you. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=544.8s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about reconciliation. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=545.92s)]
*  What you're hearing from your colleagues and what are you hearing from your constituents [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=547.8s)]
*  in Alabama? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=550.92s)]
*  Look, Alabama is ready for results and that's what they've gotten under President Trump. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=551.92s)]
*  It's been promises made, promises kept, and this is just a continuation of that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=556.16s)]
*  I think it's exciting to see the progress that the president has already made on the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=560.72s)]
*  border. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=563.88s)]
*  You know, you had the president and you had Senate Republicans and Senate House members [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=564.88s)]
*  say we're going to actually secure our border and we're going to keep Americans safe. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=568.12s)]
*  You're going to see more of that in reconciliation. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=571.64s)]
*  You're going to see us be able to invest in our defense industry in the way that we need [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=573.58s)]
*  to. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=577.0s)]
*  When you look at 21st century threats that are coming, now is the time for us to modernize. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=578.0s)]
*  When you look at energy, I mean, everyone in Alabama knows that energy affects everything. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=582.76s)]
*  When you're talking about the economy and prices, being able to drive down everything [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=587.48s)]
*  from the gas pump to the grocery store and everything in between, unleashing American [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=591.04s)]
*  energy and creating dominance. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=595.88s)]
*  I mean, President Trump has a vision, he has a plan, and he has a will to execute and we're [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  right there alongside him and Alabamians are excited. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=602.1999999999999s)]
*  We're going to get to hear from this great group in just a second. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=605.04s)]
*  I want to just tell you moments ago, the president delivered remarks at the National Republican [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=607.28s)]
*  Congressional Committee dinner where he did urge unity and for Republicans to be successful, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=611.8s)]
*  they better unite. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=618.8399999999999s)]
*  It's so important that we passed a big, beautiful bill because that's going to be, and I really [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  think, and I really think we're helped a lot by the tariff situation that's going [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=625.3599999999999s)]
*  on, which is a good situation, not a bad, it's great. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=630.68s)]
*  It's going to be legendary. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=633.4s)]
*  You watch, legendary in a positive way, I have to say. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=634.64s)]
*  It's going to be legendary, but I really think it actually puts pressure on those few Republicans [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=638.88s)]
*  that just can't get there. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=644.48s)]
*  You know what the alternative is? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=648.52s)]
*  A Democrat bill or a chapter for the country. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, we have the debt continuation and they have to do this. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=653.0s)]
*  They have to get there and I think we are there. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=658.24s)]
*  We had a great meeting today. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=661.2s)]
*  I think we are there, but just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there, you [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=662.36s)]
*  just got to get there. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=666.44s)]
*  Close your eyes and get there. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=668.18s)]
*  It's a phenomenal bill. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtePT0BXr0&t=669.5s)]
