# 'I DON'T RECALL': Biden couldn't remember dates, times and places
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk)
*  Also tonight, another shocking revelation from tonight's release of the Her audios, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=0.0s)]
*  it was Biden's complete inability to remember he had kept classified documents. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Have a listen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=11.68s)]
*  So that's the reason I asked, is if it was something that you wanted to hang on to because [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=12.68s)]
*  it was going to be the subject of reporting or history? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=17.68s)]
*  I wanted to be subject to reporting, but I wanted to hang on, I guess I wanted to hang [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=20.68s)]
*  on to it just for posterity's sake. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=25.0s)]
*  I mean, this was my position on Afghanistan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=27.52s)]
*  I've been of view from a historical standpoint that there are certain points in history, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=30.52s)]
*  world history, where fundamental things change using technology. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  For example, without Gutenberg's printing press, Europe would be a very different place, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  literally a different place because countries would not have known what was happening in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  other countries. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=56.52s)]
*  Joining us now is Senator Marcia Blackburn of Tennessee. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=57.52s)]
*  Senator, we have a release of these tapes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  There are more than six hours of tapes, but we've only heard less than 13 minutes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  What's your impression after hearing those 13 minutes? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  When you listen to these tapes, Jason, what you see is we had a President Joe Biden who [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  clearly could not remember dates, times, places, was very confused and really saw no [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=83.52s)]
*  reason that he should not have all the documents that he wanted to have because it was his [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=91.52s)]
*  memory, it was his position. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=97.52s)]
*  I find it just so troubling, but you know, one of the things when you look at this, when [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=100.52s)]
*  you look at what James Comey has done, you realize how deep the two tiers of justice [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=105.52s)]
*  really ran through the Biden administration and thank goodness we have President Donald [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=113.52s)]
*  Trump, we have A.G. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=119.52s)]
*  Bundy, we have Cash Patel, we have people focused on cleaning this up and putting a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=121.52s)]
*  stop to this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=127.52s)]
*  You're on the Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  My understanding here is, well, I want to get a clarification. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=131.52s)]
*  What will Senate Judiciary do? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=136.52s)]
*  They've got the gavel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=138.52s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=139.52s)]
*  Because the cover-up within the White House, you have General Counsel's Office, you have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=141.52s)]
*  the White House Counsel's Office, you have these attorneys who were there at the White [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=147.52s)]
*  House. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=152.52s)]
*  There is the First Lady, there is the Attorney General. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=153.52s)]
*  Do you believe there is a fiduciary responsibility to inform others that the President of the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=158.52s)]
*  United States, the person with the codes to the nuclear bombs, was not of the cognitive [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=163.52s)]
*  capability to make good, rational, regular decisions? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=169.52s)]
*  And it's amazing to me also what they did in terms of going after Special Counsel Herr. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=173.52s)]
*  They tried to discredit him immediately. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=179.52s)]
*  Of course they did, because they were running the country by committee. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=183.52s)]
*  We all continued to hear that, that Biden was not the one that was making decisions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=188.52s)]
*  But yes, indeed, this is something that needs our attention and our investigation, both [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=194.52s)]
*  the House and the Senate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=200.52s)]
*  It also is going to need investigative work by the Department of Justice and the FBI. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=202.52s)]
*  And Jason, we are very, we've got a lot that we're looking at. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=209.52s)]
*  But the American people voted on November 5th to change how things were done. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=214.52s)]
*  They gave a mandate to Donald Trump. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=220.52s)]
*  They want to put an end to this two tiers of justice. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=222.52s)]
*  They want to put an end to having government weaponized against people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=226.52s)]
*  And, you know, look at what is happening with deportations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=233.52s)]
*  And you've got mayors like our Nashville mayor here in Tennessee that is trying to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=238.52s)]
*  defend these criminal illegal aliens and protect them from deportations. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=243.52s)]
*  Senator, you do have your... [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=250.52s)]
*  You need to look at all of them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmUDAJaRLdk&t=252.52s)]
