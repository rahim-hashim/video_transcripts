# ‘NO HUMAN EMPATHY’: Trump advisor lambasts media that ‘refused’ to cover victims of migrant crime
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io)
*  All right, here with reaction White House deputy chief of policy Homeland Security adviser [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=0.0s)]
*  Stephen Miller. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=4.32s)]
*  You know what, Stephen Miller? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=5.32s)]
*  During the campaign, I would, on this program, scroll the names of dozens of Americans murdered [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=6.32s)]
*  by Biden-Harris illegals. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=12.4s)]
*  I would scroll the names of dozens of Americans raped by Biden-Harris illegals. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=13.76s)]
*  I would scroll the thousands of names of Americans that were victims of violent crime by Biden-Harris [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=19.16s)]
*  illegals. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=26.84s)]
*  The media never wanted to pay attention to it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=27.84s)]
*  What I like about what you're doing now is it's going to be right behind them in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=29.6s)]
*  shot. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  They'll do everything they can do to blur it and obscure it and pixel it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  But to be honest, the fact that it's there is a reminder to them of their failure. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=39.72s)]
*  The White House correspondents' nerd prom thing that they had on Saturday night that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=44.54s)]
*  nobody cares about and that will probably be dead and gone in a few years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=49.6s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  These are the people that never reported those names. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  They never talked about, not just Rachel Moore and Jocelyn Nungary and Lake and Wright, they [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=56.94s)]
*  didn't talk about any of the victims. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=62.5s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=64.64s)]
*  They lied for four years and helped the Biden administration. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=65.64s)]
*  Reaction. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Every day, I see on my desk, Sean, examples of the illegal aliens that President Trump's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=70.25999999999999s)]
*  Department of Homeland Security and Justice have arrested and the heinous, unthinkable [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=80.94s)]
*  crimes they've committed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=86.1s)]
*  The assault and rape of underage children, the violent beating and murder of moms, shooting [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=87.86s)]
*  innocent people in cold blood in the street, crime after crime after crime. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  And as you said, Sean, those sanctimonious, pompous jerks in the left-wing corporate press [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=102.41999999999999s)]
*  refuse to cover any of these crimes, refuse to interview or cover any of their victims. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=109.25999999999999s)]
*  Do not demonstrate an ounce of human empathy for any of the suffering that Joe Biden's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=116.02s)]
*  border invasion, the Democrat Party's border invasion has wrought on this country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=121.28s)]
*  And so the White House, so President Trump's White House, has forced brilliantly these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=126.08s)]
*  outlets to acknowledge these crimes, to acknowledge these atrocities by putting these posters, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=131.44s)]
*  these mugshots and their criminal histories right behind them as they stand there and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=137.4s)]
*  do their shots every single day. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  And we're going to keep forcing the media to cover the atrocities committed by the illegal [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=143.86s)]
*  aliens that Joe Biden and the Democrat Party have brought into our country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=148.46s)]
*  Well, they did. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=152.58s)]
*  And this is the point. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=154.12s)]
*  Now the president, and we have some amazing numbers, we've made amazing progress, but [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=155.34s)]
*  we still have known murderers, known terrorists, known rapists, known gang members, known cartel [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=160.78000000000003s)]
*  members in the country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if we can ever tell the American people that we've been able to eliminate [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=168.78000000000003s)]
*  all of them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=173.73999999999998s)]
*  What do you do when people like Gavin Newsom out in California, sanctuary states, sanctuary [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  cities all over his state? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=179.78s)]
*  You know, all right, finally they're cooperating with ICE, but that was after, you know, the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=182.06s)]
*  threat of, oh, I need a war chest so I can get into legal battle after legal battle with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=192.89999999999998s)]
*  They don't want to uphold the law. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  Look at that judge in Wisconsin for crying out loud, aiding and abetting somebody that, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=196.7s)]
*  you know, walk out a side door to evade ICE. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=201.86s)]
*  What do you do when people are helping like that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=206.06s)]
*  Well, so California, as an example, still has a law on the books preventing, ordering [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=208.58s)]
*  police departments and sheriffs not to hand over criminal illegal aliens to ICE. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=216.86s)]
*  That law is still in place and in effect as we speak. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=222.7s)]
*  You have Governor Pritzker, that monstrous mess of a governor in Illinois who again [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=226.78s)]
*  refuses to hand over even illegal aliens charged with serious criminal offenses to ICE for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=232.06s)]
*  deportation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=237.9s)]
*  Democrats up and down this country, including those Democrats making fools of themselves [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=239.5s)]
*  in the steps of the Capitol, are putting all of their energy into keeping these illegal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=243.3s)]
*  alien criminals, these terrorists, these gang members in our communities. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=248.38s)]
*  President Trump, his first job, which he accomplished in unimaginable time, was to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=254.42s)]
*  seal the southern border shut and he did it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=259.46s)]
*  Ninety-nine point nine nine percent of people have been blocked from entering this country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=262.38s)]
*  Only three people were allowed into the country and that was for legitimate medical purposes [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=267.02s)]
*  in the last month. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  We've gone from thousands and thousands a day to just three people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=275.41999999999996s)]
*  Unimaginable progress. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  And even those three were for legitimate medical purposes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  You have a Democrat Party now that is fighting to keep all of the people Joe Biden set free [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=284.34s)]
*  in this country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  President Trump is mobilizing state, local and federal law enforcement to find and remove [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=290.73999999999995s)]
*  these threats. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=295.94s)]
*  And we're also battling these crazy rogue district courts. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=296.94s)]
*  But President Trump's plan and strategy is working. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=300.06s)]
*  We are going to win these cases. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  We are going to mobilize an army of immigration law enforcement officers and we are going [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=305.02s)]
*  to fulfill President Trump's pledge, vow and promise to liberate our communities from [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=309.62s)]
*  this gang threat. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=315.1s)]
*  And it's going to happen, Sean. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=316.1s)]
*  It is happening, Sean. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=317.3s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=319.22s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=320.3s)]
*  Biden, Harris, Mayorkas and all these sanctuary people aiding and abetting. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=321.3s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=326.66s)]
*  They have blood on their hands. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=327.66s)]
*  Period end of sentence. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=329.46s)]
*  They allowed this to happen. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=330.6s)]
*  Amen. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=331.6s)]
*  This was the most preventable national security disaster. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=332.6s)]
*  They are complicit with evil, Sean. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=333.86s)]
*  Sad. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=337.54s)]
*  Some people died and are dying still. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=338.7s)]
*  Steve Miller, thank you. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=341.3s)]
*  When we come back. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rScVKcW5io&t=342.3s)]
