# Newt Gingrich: We taught the world a lesson
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M)
*  Anyway, here with reaction to all of tonight's top stories, Fox News contributor, former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=0.0s)]
*  speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=3.68s)]
*  As a historian and professor and friend—forget being speaker, although that was a pretty [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=6.68s)]
*  important job you had, and you did balance the budget five straight years in a row—if [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  I would have told you that Donald Trump will give the Republic of Iran 60 days to come [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=15.92s)]
*  and willingly give up their nuclear program, that on day 61 Israel would go in, knock out [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=23.64s)]
*  their missile defense system so they would own the skies over Iran, that they would have [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  operatives on the ground with drones inside of Iran, ready to take out top nuclear scientists, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=38.92s)]
*  top generals, simultaneously devastating their missile batteries, ballistic missile systems, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=45.48s)]
*  and two nuclear sites, and then culminating with Saturday night Donald Trump knocking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=53.12s)]
*  out the three nuclear sites that mattered and obliterating them, and then at the end [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=58.08s)]
*  of 12 days we'd have a ceasefire that's holding? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=64.72s)]
*  I don't think I would have believed that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=68.28s)]
*  I would have said no way. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=69.6s)]
*  Historically, how do you view that? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=71.24s)]
*  Well, I think it's actually about right. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=74.96s)]
*  The Israelis have proven over and over and over again that they have enormous capabilities. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=79.55999999999999s)]
*  That part doesn't surprise me to a degree that—I just wrote a piece on this at Gingrich [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  360 as a newsletter. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  Look, Trump is very disciplined. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=94.32s)]
*  People don't realize this, because there's so much noise around him. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  But he's very disciplined. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=99.6s)]
*  He has a clearer vision of what he wants to get done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=101.68s)]
*  He knows how to build a team. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=104.08s)]
*  And I thought he showed an enormous capacity and a great deal of courage in being patient. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=106.48s)]
*  He had all sorts of friends, as you know. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=113.48s)]
*  He had all sorts of friends who were worried about him. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=115.64s)]
*  Was he going to go wobbly? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Was he going to get weak? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=119.48s)]
*  No. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=120.68s)]
*  He had a clear deadline. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=121.68s)]
*  He artfully said to the world, I would really like to avoid this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=123.16s)]
*  I hope the Iranians will work with me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=127.84s)]
*  I'm giving them 60 days, and I'm confident that he and Bibi had an agreement months ago. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  On day 61, the Israelis could launch a plan, which they have been working on for years. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  And then, after they finished cleaning up the entire air defense system, if they called [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=141.32s)]
*  him and said, you know, we really do need help to take out these three facilities, we [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=146.32s)]
*  had a plan which I think started eight or nine years ago in planning. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  And we also taught the world a lesson. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=156.16s)]
*  We can launch bombers from Missouri to anywhere in the world and have precision targets that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=158.92s)]
*  are annihilating. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=167.72s)]
*  And we are prepared to defend America and to defend America's allies. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=169.48s)]
*  Now, to me, the test is going to be, what are the terms of the truce? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Are the Iranians, in fact, going to try to cheat, or are they going to recognize that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=180.2s)]
*  between Israel and the United States, they're in a total overmatch and they can't possibly [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=186.12s)]
*  succeed? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=191.56s)]
*  I don't think we know yet how stubborn the Ayatollah Khamenei is going to be. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=192.56s)]
*  OK, I would say that the first thing I would look out for, and it has to be part of any [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  ceasefire deal, when they finally get to the table, and they will, and I believe Steve [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=202.0s)]
*  Witkoff and Secretary of State Rubio will be a part of it, that Iran cannot use their [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=206.32s)]
*  proxies and arm them and fire at Israel at will and thinking that they are blameless [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=212.64s)]
*  in that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  That would be issue number one. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=220.72s)]
*  Issue number two, anywhere, anyplace, any time inspections, that they're not trying [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=222.44s)]
*  to rebuild their nuclear program or their ballistic missile batteries and program, because [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=226.61999999999998s)]
*  the missiles they were firing into densely populated civilian areas were 2,000 pounds. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  Now they want to build 4,000-pound missiles. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=239.72s)]
*  That could wreak a lot of havoc, and that's a lot of carnage and a lot of death. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=243.48s)]
*  So I think that has to be part of it, and it probably would be nice if they recognized [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=247.68s)]
*  Israel as part of a peace plan if they really want peace. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=251.4s)]
*  I don't expect they're going to do that, Mr. Speaker. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=255.96s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=258.48s)]
*  I want peace. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=259.48s)]
*  But I, you know, if you say death to America, death to Israel, I assume you mean it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=260.48s)]
*  Look, I think you just put your finger on it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=265.76s)]
*  The minimums for thinking this is successful is quit saying death to Israel and death to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=269.44s)]
*  America. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=274.76s)]
*  You don't have to recognize Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=275.76s)]
*  You can no longer say death to Israel and death to America. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=276.76s)]
*  No more ballistic missile developments, period, and open inspection of all nuclear capability, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=279.5s)]
*  including finding the 400 kilograms of uranium that they have moved out of the sites. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=287.0s)]
*  Now either they're prepared to do that, or, frankly, the truce will have to end, and we'll [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=292.88s)]
*  have to go back to the Israelis and potentially the Americans bombing them into submission. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=298.72s)]
*  I think the question here for the Ayatollah Khomeini is, does his regime survive better [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=304.12s)]
*  by caving and accepting these conditions, or would his regime be destroyed by accepting [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=310.6s)]
*  these conditions, and therefore he's better off to go down fighting? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=318.2s)]
*  I don't think we know yet which decision he'll make. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=321.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think we will either. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=327.6s)]
*  The world is a safer place today. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=328.6s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  Speaker Gingrich, thank you for being with us. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s38Lrh6gT8M&t=332.20000000000005s)]
