# Trump 'border czar' blasts Dem charged with assaulting ICE agents
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM)
*  Now, during his gaggle with reporters, President Trump also defended the charges against a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=0.0s)]
*  New Jersey congresswoman, LaMonica McIver, who is facing a felony charge of assaulting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=6.92s)]
*  a federal officer following a skirmish at an ICE facility earlier this month. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=13.08s)]
*  Here's what President Trump said. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=18.2s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=19.52s)]
*  Did you see her? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=20.52s)]
*  She was out of control. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=21.52s)]
*  Did you? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=22.52s)]
*  Those days are over. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=23.52s)]
*  The days of woke—the days of woke—no, I didn't. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=24.52s)]
*  The days of woke are over. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=27.52s)]
*  That woman, I have no idea who she is. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=29.4s)]
*  That woman was out of control. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=32.4s)]
*  She was shoving federal agents. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=33.96s)]
*  She was out of control. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=35.56s)]
*  The days of that crap are over. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=37.2s)]
*  They're over. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, Congressman Fang Fang, Eric Swalwell, he's facing backlash for his comments on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=41.16s)]
*  MSDNC about the charges, which some could perceive as a threat. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=46.68s)]
*  You decide. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=52.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=53.36s)]
*  We can't trust them, so we have to do our oversight duties. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  And she was in the right to go and do that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=57.54s)]
*  And I promise you, there's going to be more unnoticed—or, yeah, unnoticed visits [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=59.5s)]
*  for my colleagues, where they show up and they better be let in. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=64.86s)]
*  Here with reaction, Trump administration boarder, Czar Tom Homan. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=69.94s)]
*  Well, the days of this crap are over. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=72.98s)]
*  That's what the president said. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=75.25999999999999s)]
*  So what do you say, Tom? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  I'd say, look, the president doesn't bluff. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=80.94s)]
*  I don't bluff. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=83.1s)]
*  I said the day after inauguration, when they started attacking ICE and border control and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=84.14s)]
*  supporting sanctuary cities, I said, you can hate on ICE. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=88.38s)]
*  You can support sanctuary cities. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=91.38s)]
*  You can turn a blind eye to ICE taking public safety threats off your streets. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  But you can't cross that line. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=97.06s)]
*  Sean, I said that a thousand times. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=98.41999999999999s)]
*  You can't cross a line of impediment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=100.34s)]
*  You can't cross a line of annoyingly harboring, concealing, illegal alien from ICE. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=102.41999999999999s)]
*  You can't commit criminal trespass. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  And you certainly can't put hands on an ICE officer or you will be prosecuted. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=109.96s)]
*  I said it a thousand times. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=114.96s)]
*  I meant it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  President Trump means it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  We already got two judges being prosecuted. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Now we got this councilwoman being prosecuted. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  It's the right thing to do, because they broke the law. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=122.96s)]
*  They're not above the law either. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=125.44s)]
*  They say President Trump wasn't above the law. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  Either are they. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=129.04s)]
*  You heard Congressman Swalwell. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=130.74s)]
*  Sounds like there's going to be more of this, or he's promising more of this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=134.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to it? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  They better do it in a professional manner. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  If they try to push their way into the facility and commit trespass, they'll be charged. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=142.72s)]
*  If they put hands on an officer, they'll be charged. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  You know what the most disgusting thing about this is? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=149.72s)]
*  While she's putting hands on an ICE officer, I'm attending Blue Mass from Washington, DC [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=152.56s)]
*  for the heroes, the law enforcement, federal, state, and local who gave their lives for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  this country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to the Border Patrol Memorial. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to the ICE Memorial to pay tribute to the men and women who wear a badge and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=164.84s)]
*  gun and to their families who lost their loved ones. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=168.76s)]
*  And they got to deal with that every day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=171.92s)]
*  Children without fathers that died in line of duty. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=173.32s)]
*  At the same time we're doing that along with President Trump in Washington, DC, they're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=175.6s)]
*  assaulting ICE agents. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  It is just disgusting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  And they're going to be held accountable. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Every single time they break the law, we'll be looking for prosecution. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=183.6s)]
*  Let me ask you a last question. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=186.72s)]
*  Sanctuary cities and states, those that aid in a bet in law breaking and provide benefits [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=188.48s)]
*  to people that are not in our country legally, can they be held accountable? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  They're going to be held accountable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=198.36s)]
*  Pam Bonnie's already filing lawsuits. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  We're making some few changes on the detainers to make it clear on the detainers that this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=204.8s)]
*  person is a known terrorist. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=209.56s)]
*  This person is a known felon. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  This person public safety threat. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  And see if they honor the detainers. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  See if they honor the Lincoln-Riley Act. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  So yeah, we're taking it full on. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  Sanctuary cities are sanctuary for criminals. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=220.28000000000003s)]
*  There's no place in this country that ICE is removing public safety threats from the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=222.36s)]
*  streets of this country every day, making this country safer every day. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=226.96s)]
*  And we're not going to stop. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Every known terrorist, murderer, rapist, filing criminal, cartel member, gang member, they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=233.32s)]
*  must go. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=238.1s)]
*  We've got to find them all. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=239.1s)]
*  You're doing a great job. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=240.1s)]
*  Tom, thank you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tomd_rl20OM&t=241.1s)]
