# APRIL FOOL’S DAY ‘INSANITY’: Sean Hannity RAILS against Dems’ tactics
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8)
*  But in honor of April Fool's Day, we begin tonight with more insanity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=0.0s)]
*  It never ends from the Democratic Party. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=4.74s)]
*  For some reason, Cory Booker decided to speak nonstop on the Senate floor for 24 hours, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=6.66s)]
*  no food, no bathroom breaks, no silence, just Cory Booker's performative art at a podium, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=12.82s)]
*  talking for hours, saying nothing worthwhile. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=19.86s)]
*  And of course, it's not a filibuster. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=23.64s)]
*  He's not officially blocking any bill, but he did go on and on and on, all about his [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=25.74s)]
*  hatred of all things. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump, what a shock. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=33.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=34.68s)]
*  I confess that I have been imperfect. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=35.68s)]
*  I confess that I've been inadequate to the moment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=39.14s)]
*  I confess that the Democratic Party has made terrible mistakes that have given lane to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=42.28s)]
*  this demagogue. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  We need you now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=51.82s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=53.34s)]
*  If you love her, if you love your neighbor, if you love this country, show your love. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=54.9s)]
*  I don't want a dissonification of our history. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  I don't want a whitewashed history. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=63.82s)]
*  I don't want a homogenized history. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=65.25999999999999s)]
*  Tell me the wretched truth about America. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=67.06s)]
*  Today and to tomorrow, I'm going to stand as long as I can. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=69.44s)]
*  As long as I can, I'm going to stand and read stories like this because you are seen, you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=73.28s)]
*  are heard. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=78.06s)]
*  When is it going to be enough? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=79.06s)]
*  My voice is inadequate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=80.74s)]
*  My efforts today are inadequate to stop what they're trying to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=82.38s)]
*  Nobody was watching. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=89.3s)]
*  We haven't seen this much bravery from Cory Booker since he referred to himself as Spartacus. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=90.58s)]
*  That was during the Kavanaugh witch hunt. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=96.5s)]
*  But when you think the hysteria can't get any worse, well, think again. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=98.82s)]
*  Last night on MSDNC, far-left Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal promoted her very own training [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=102.3s)]
*  program to teach the American people how to fight back against looming Trump dictatorship [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=110.5s)]
*  that's about to occur. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=116.98s)]
*  I mean, what we decided is that we really need to help Americans understand what happens [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=117.98s)]
*  when democracies fall, when dictators take over. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=123.94s)]
*  We've been pretty complacent in America. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=127.38s)]
*  We haven't had to really deal with this in any real way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=129.58s)]
*  And now I think people need to understand what are the lessons from other countries. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=133.78s)]
*  In working with experts who have studied democratic backsliding in countries around the world [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=138.32s)]
*  and the resistance movements that emerged to take on that democratic backsliding, we've [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  developed a curriculum where we help people understand how do you go after the pillars [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=148.76s)]
*  of support—not necessarily the person at the top, but the pillars of support that allow [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=154.92s)]
*  that person to continue to have power, and how do you shift allies from being sort of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=159.92s)]
*  passive opponents to being active supporters of taking down a dictatorship. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=165.52s)]
*  How to be a left-wing squad lunatic and not to be outdone on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin may be my favorite quote of the year, as usual, making a complete [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=178.28s)]
*  jackass out of himself and is now demanding that Donald Trump bring back the violent, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  Trendy Aragwa, gang members that President Trump deported to El Salvador. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=190.24s)]
*  Wow, I have a condition. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=197.36s)]
*  I call on them to demand that the Trump administration comply with all judicial orders while appealing [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=198.8s)]
*  whichever ones they want to appeal and to demand the return of people unlawfully taken [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=204.72s)]
*  to El Salvador on that so-called plane full of gang bangers. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=210.68s)]
*  I'll cut a deal with Jamie Raskin. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=215.88s)]
*  I'll be fine with his plan as long as the Trendy Aragwa gang members live in Jamie Raskin's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=217.76s)]
*  house with ankle bracelets. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  We'll have more on these gang members coming up with Senator Ted Cruz tonight, but while [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=225.55999999999997s)]
*  Raskin has most concerns with the rights of criminal illegal aliens over the safety of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  American citizens, his colleague—well, she's in the news every day—Jasmine Crockett is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=235.32s)]
*  focused on America's far-left activist judges now abusing their power in a desperate attempt [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  to thwart Donald Trump's agenda. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=246.72s)]
*  Today, she just couldn't believe that Republicans would dare criticize federal judges. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=248.4s)]
*  That is until Congressman Darrell Issa reminded her about her plan to impeach justices Clarence [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=254.32s)]
*  Thomas and Sam Alito. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=261.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=263.76s)]
*  The problem that we have right now is that if we continue down this road, then we will [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=265.24s)]
*  not have a rule of law because we have people that are currently serving and they're saying [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=269.48s)]
*  things like, ignore the judge's order. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=273.68s)]
*  What it means to have law and order in this country is that you follow the order and you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=276.96s)]
*  go through the appeals process even if you dislike what the judge did. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=281.24s)]
*  Thank you and I yield. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=285.88s)]
*  I'll yield back to you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=286.88s)]
*  Mr. Issa, you had a question for me which I'll yield to you now if you want to. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=287.88s)]
*  Now that there's no time left? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=291.08s)]
*  Thanks, Eric. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=292.56s)]
*  I can entertain it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=293.56s)]
*  You're good. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=294.56s)]
*  You're good at that, but I'll take my own time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=295.56s)]
*  I'll recognize myself. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=297.96s)]
*  And I'm going to note that when Ms. LaCasio Cortez, or AOC as we know her, filed articles [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=298.96s)]
*  of impeachment on Justice Thomas and Alito, Ms. Crockett was one of the co-sponsor along [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=308.96s)]
*  with Mr. Cohen, both members of this committee. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=315.0s)]
*  It does seem interesting that when the shoe is on the other foot, everyone is self-righteous. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=318.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=322.84s)]
*  Really great minor reminder. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=325.76s)]
*  Oopsie daisy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=326.76s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=327.76s)]
*  Also, remember, top Democrats even supported court packing all in an effort to all but [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=328.76s)]
*  eliminate the judicial branch of government. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=334.56s)]
*  But of course, they now love judges who use nationwide injunctions against Donald Trump [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=337.12s)]
*  with regularity. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  Now think about it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=344.04s)]
*  One far left, unelected judge representing a lower court gets to stop a duly elected [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=345.04s)]
*  In this case, Donald Trump and a policy nationwide even before that case is adjudicated. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=351.36s)]
*  That is a nationwide injunction. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=357.72s)]
*  This never once happened before 1963. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=359.8s)]
*  George W. Bush faced only six nationwide injunctions in two terms. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=363.72s)]
*  Obama in two terms, he was subject to 12. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=369.56s)]
*  But during Trump's first term, there were a whopping 64 nationwide injunctions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=373.04s)]
*  Then back down to 14 under Joe Biden. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=378.56s)]
*  So far, in just the first two months of his second term, President Trump has already eclipsed [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=381.12s)]
*  that number with 17 nationwide injunctions. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=386.9s)]
*  This is just more democratic lawfare, more weaponization of our justice system. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  This needs to be cleaned up. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=395.44s)]
*  And while Democrats in Congress, they scream and they yell and they make fools out of themselves, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=397.12s)]
*  this is the real resistance to Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=401.72s)]
*  They're using unelected judges. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=404.68s)]
*  What they can't win at the ballot box, what they can't get done legislatively, they run [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=406.96s)]
*  to judicial activist judges acting as kings, even blocking staffing decisions in the executive [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=411.2s)]
*  branch of government. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=418.0s)]
*  At one point, a judge seemingly barred the Treasury Secretary, Scott Bissen, viewing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=419.44s)]
*  files at his own Department of Treasury. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  And you know, is this not insane and totally unconstitutional? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=427.12s)]
*  As Senator Grassley pointed out today in the Wall Street Journal, quote, Article three [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=431.32s)]
*  of our Constitution, task the judicial branch with resolving cases and controversies, not [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=435.58s)]
*  making policies. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=442.38s)]
*  According to a story in the Wall Street Journal, many of these injunctions also break what's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=444.18s)]
*  called Rule 65C. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId5k_sPW_8&t=448.58s)]
