# EGGCELLENT PRICES?: Agriculture secretary on making eggs ‘affordable again’ #eggprice #foxnews
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI)
*  Here now with much more, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary Rollins, it is such a pleasure to see you tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=4.68s)]
*  And I know President Trump credits you personally with bringing down the price of eggs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=8.34s)]
*  They hit $5.37 at some point during Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=13.6s)]
*  Now I checked about $3.13. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=16.8s)]
*  How did you do this? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=19.6s)]
*  Well, hi, Kellyanne. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=21.6s)]
*  What a joy to be on with you today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=24.04s)]
*  Oh my goodness, we have had quite a couple of months. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=26.64s)]
*  But yes, the president has talked a lot about how the eggs were up 237% during Joe Biden, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=30.08s)]
*  but no one talked about it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=38.32s)]
*  But the minute that he took office, then all of a sudden it's his fault. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=39.72s)]
*  So one of the first conversations we had was how in the world, Brooke, you got to go fix it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=44.2s)]
*  We got to figure out what to do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=48.6s)]
*  So we rolled out a pretty massive five point plan, repopulation, importing eggs, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  ensuring that we were getting the right deregulation out, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=57.16s)]
*  And the price of eggs almost immediately started to come down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  So the president has been very vocal about making sure that we have the price of groceries are coming down, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=65.88s)]
*  that in fact that we're doing everything we can to ensure that groceries and really all things [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  that American consumers need are affordable again. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  Secretary Rollins, you were confirmed with quite a high number of Democrats in favor of your nomination. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=81.56s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=87.76s)]
*  But when I see someone like New York Governor Kathy Hochul politicizing the price of eggs and pretending [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  that New York, which she has overtaxed and overregulated, refusing to frack and all of that, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=93.68s)]
*  she pretends that she can't afford eggs at the governor's mansion. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=99.76s)]
*  How do you deal with Democrats trying to politicize eggs? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=102.72s)]
*  And I think she's a special case. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  I think if Kathy Hochul were an egg, she would not be sunny-side up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=107.16s)]
*  She'd be scrambled. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=109.96s)]
*  So maybe she's a special case. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  But do you feel like you can work with Democrats on something as simple as this and all the great work you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=112.36s)]
*  need to do at the Department of Agriculture with our farmers, our ranchers, our school lunch program? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's so true. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=124.0s)]
*  And honestly, we have had a lot of governors we're working with right now on SNAP reform that are Democrat. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=125.72s)]
*  Of course, all the Republicans are completely open to the America First agenda. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=132.04s)]
*  You know this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=135.2s)]
*  We've worked together a long time, but we've actually had some Democrats, Governor Polis of Colorado and a few [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=135.92s)]
*  others, have stepped up. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=141.04s)]
*  They want to do real reform. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=142.6s)]
*  And I think there's no question the Food Stamp program is run by the USDA, that the amount of money that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=145.44s)]
*  taxpayers are spending to buy junk food and sodas for kids that's not healthy and then we pay for it on the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=150.84s)]
*  back end as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=158.56s)]
*  So, you know, there are some that we're working across party lines with, some we can't. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=159.84s)]
*  Perhaps Governor Hochul is one of those that can't. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=164.64s)]
*  But, you know, it is a new day in Washington and the president is leading the way. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=166.72s)]
*  So many people are alongside him, both on the inside and on the outside, and just working really hard to make [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=171.32s)]
*  America great again. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=177.44s)]
*  And Brooke, when we think about the USDA, each of us probably thinks of something different. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=179.28s)]
*  Some folks will think about agriculture, others livestock. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=183.6s)]
*  Some will think of SNAP and the school lunch program. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=186.12s)]
*  Others will think of any any number of issues facing them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=189.04s)]
*  Tell us about the next 100 days or the rest of this calendar year for the USDA. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=193.68s)]
*  What are your priorities as its secretary? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=198.08s)]
*  Well, as you have probably witnessed, because these are a lot of your really good friends, too, this cabinet [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=202.16s)]
*  is hyper focused and completely intent on deploying and employing and implementing President Trump's vision of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=208.8s)]
*  really bringing the power and returning it back to the people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=217.24s)]
*  So across all the cabinets, not just USDA deregulation, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=221.16s)]
*  I mean, ensuring that we're getting government off the backs of the people. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=225.64s)]
*  Of course, at USDA, it's making sure that we're realigning an entire department around putting farmers and ranchers [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=229.2s)]
*  first and making farming great again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=236.32s)]
*  And certainly with the trades and the tariffs and the cost of labor. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=239.2s)]
*  And I mean, many of much of this was under Joe Biden. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  But how do we ensure that we are realigning an American economy that puts America first and puts our farmers and our ranchers first? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=245.8s)]
*  So we'll keep doing that all day, every day, seven days a week at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=253.24s)]
*  But what's really exciting is that it's happening across the entire government, the federal government and in partnership with the governors out in the states. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=258.16s)]
*  Secretary Rollins, as these bilateral trade deals come to be with other countries and companies, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=266.44s)]
*  how hopeful are your farmers and ranchers that we're going to be able to open up new markets around the world for American products? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=271.64s)]
*  Well, that is a massive focus at USDA. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=279.44s)]
*  There was a zero dollar trade deficit when we left four years ago, Kellyanne, when you and I sort of walked out together. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=283.12s)]
*  Four years later, there's an almost a 50 billion dollar trade deficit with just our agriculture products. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=289.8s)]
*  That's 50 billion less dollars that's in the pockets of our farmers and ranchers and our ag community and rural the community across the country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  So I'll be visiting six countries in the next couple of months, Vietnam, India, Brazil, Peru, Japan, etc., [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=304.04s)]
*  to ensure that we're moving our products back out into the world, not only feeding America, which is most important, putting America first. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  Food security is national security, as we all know, but also opening up markets around the world [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=319.68s)]
*  so that our farmers and our ranchers and our rural communities can see prosperity like they've never seen before. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=325.2s)]
*  Secretary Brooke Rollins of the United States Department of Agriculture, happy Holy Easter to you and your beautiful family. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2tsCAeRRI&t=331.24s)]
