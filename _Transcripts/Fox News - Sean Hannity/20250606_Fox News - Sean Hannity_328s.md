# Dems have ‘scrambled around’ since this ‘iceberg moment’: Lara Trump
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag)
*  All right, here with more of the host of The Hitch Show, My View, with Laura Trump right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=0.0s)]
*  here on the Fox News Channel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=4.48s)]
*  Laura Trump is with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=5.64s)]
*  Laura, great to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  I know the state-run legacy media mob, they only want to talk about Elon Musk and Donald [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=14.16s)]
*  They've exchanged words, and they don't have a perfect relationship. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=15.16s)]
*  I predict they'll be friends again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=18.12s)]
*  Just my idea. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=19.68s)]
*  But yet they're ignoring the radicalism in their own party. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=21.48s)]
*  You know, they're doubling down and tripling down on stupid. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=25.2s)]
*  Now Hakeem Jeffries, he wants to dox ICE agents. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=29.44s)]
*  And Boston mayor is referring to ICE agents as Nazis. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  They just don't get it, but their rhetoric is also dangerous. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=40.64s)]
*  Want to get your reaction? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=45.32s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=46.32s)]
*  Well, you're exactly right, Sean. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=47.32s)]
*  And I mean, look, the problem the Democrats have right now, and the legacy media for that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  matter, is that nothing they're talking about and nothing they're doing, no policy they're [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=53.72s)]
*  actually putting forward, is anything that is going to benefit the American people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=57.8s)]
*  They are all about stunts. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=62.48s)]
*  They are all about opposing Donald Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  They're all about their Trump derangement syndrome being highlighted every single day. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=65.72s)]
*  And when you look at things like a mayor of a city, Sean, opposing police, opposing law [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=70.6s)]
*  enforcement, what is that telling the people of her city, that she doesn't care about [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=75.8s)]
*  their safety and well-being? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=79.82s)]
*  The reality with this party, and I've said this before, is that I believe 2024 was the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=82.22s)]
*  end of the Democrat Party, as we have known it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=87.12s)]
*  Their literal iceberg moment was when Joe Biden took the stage at the debate against [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump last June. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=94.64s)]
*  We're almost a year out from that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=96.04s)]
*  And that was the moment they realized they were in free fall. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=98.2s)]
*  They've scrambled around ever since. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=100.76s)]
*  And instead of putting something forward that the American people can grab onto, like, oh, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=102.68s)]
*  I don't know, closed and secure borders, like bringing inflation down, like energy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=106.2s)]
*  independence here at home, like a strong, robust military, they've gone the opposite [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=112.36s)]
*  way. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=117.0s)]
*  And not that I'm in the business, Sean, of giving any advice to the Democrats, but if [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=118.0s)]
*  I were to advise them, I would say cut out the stunts, cut out the Trump derangement [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  syndrome, focus on what the American people want. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  They spoke loudly and clear on November 5th. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=129.44s)]
*  That's why President Trump is there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=131.84s)]
*  The thing is, is they can't. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=134.4s)]
*  It's like an addiction for them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=135.88s)]
*  And they wake up every morning. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  They need that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=139.64s)]
*  It's like manna from heaven for them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=140.76s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, you know, on fake news, CNN, Medicaid for all illegals. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=142.76s)]
*  How did that work out when, let's see, Tim Walz wanted taxpayer-funded college education [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=147.94s)]
*  for illegals and Kamala wanted sex change operations for illegals and for convicts? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=153.94s)]
*  And then, of course, opening the border and allowing in known terrorists and rapists and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=160.44s)]
*  murderers, violent criminals, cartels, gang members, all the things that we talk about. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  And they still fight to champion the rights of illegals over the safety of all of us. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=171.56s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=175.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's why they have the abysmal approval rating that the Democrats have right now. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=176.56s)]
*  It's why people are leaving their party. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=181.76s)]
*  Sean, when Kareem Jean-Pierre leaves your party, the person who was the mouthpiece for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=183.72s)]
*  Joe Biden, you know you have a big problem. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=189.44s)]
*  But this is why people are so thrilled that Donald Trump is back. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=193.2s)]
*  This is why they're so thrilled that Republicans hold both the House and the Senate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=196.32s)]
*  And this is why I want everybody to pay very close attention over the next year and a half. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  We have to make sure we hold these majorities, because we know that Republicans will do the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=204.04s)]
*  right thing for the country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=209.04s)]
*  Take a look at the Democrats. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=210.52s)]
*  It would be a complete disaster to let any of those people be in charge of anything, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=211.8s)]
*  Sean. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=215.68s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that they've been so accepting of the virulent anti-Semitism [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=216.68s)]
*  in their party? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=223.68s)]
*  We see it in the halls of Congress. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=224.68s)]
*  We see it on college campuses. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=226.0s)]
*  It's spreading across the globe and spreading in our country, and they have a fear of the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  squad and the radicals within their party that they refuse to take that on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=234.68s)]
*  What does that tell you about them? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=239.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that there's a huge rift within this party. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=241.4s)]
*  You have a handful of people who are incredibly reasonable, and I'm shocked I say this every [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=252.96s)]
*  John Fetterman is one of these people who seems to speak truth, who seems to say, you [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=253.96s)]
*  know, very reasonable, you know, things that the American people agree with in large part. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  And then you have a group of people, these radical leftists, who are fully in charge [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=261.88s)]
*  of the direction of this party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=266.48s)]
*  They do have a rift. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=268.64s)]
*  I believe there's a bit of a civil war going on within their party right now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=269.64s)]
*  They don't have a leader. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=272.90000000000003s)]
*  They don't have any idea what they stand for. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=274.12s)]
*  All they do is go out and do stunts and try to distract the American people with what [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=276.48s)]
*  I call jazz hands. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  And I think they're going to have a really hard time, Sean. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=285.2s)]
*  If this is how they're going to behave, again, as the former RNC co-chair, that's okay with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=286.2s)]
*  me, but it would be nice if we had a country where both parties had a little bit of common [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=292.0s)]
*  sense. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=296.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Democrats have none of that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=297.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm perfectly okay with AOC and Jasmine Crockett and the squad and Grandpa Bernie [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=299.0s)]
*  and the radicals running the party, because I think that's better for the country, because [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=304.88s)]
*  they won't win elections. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=309.52s)]
*  Laura Trump, we'll be watching this weekend. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=310.88s)]
*  Thank you for being with us and we appreciate your time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNsixOKxvag&t=313.32s)]
