# 'Pothole Pete’ Buttigieg under fire for new 'lie'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA)
*  Well, somebody please tell Joe, if you have access to Joe, if Joe's awake for long enough [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=0.0s)]
*  to hear it, that all the land that was taken by Putin happened under his watch. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=4.2s)]
*  Crimea was taken when he was vice president and Obama was president. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=9.72s)]
*  Remember, Putin was building up his troops and his military on the border with Ukraine, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=13.52s)]
*  and Joe Biden was asked, what happens if they invade? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=18.28s)]
*  Oh, it depends if it's a minor incursion. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=21.12s)]
*  Joe Biden has no idea what this man is talking about. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=23.88s)]
*  In fact, now both Democrats and Republicans agree Biden does not have a firm grasp on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=26.68s)]
*  anything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=32.92s)]
*  He barely ever held a cabinet meeting, never mind, you know, put it out there publicly [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=34.16s)]
*  for everyone to see. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  And by the way, he just simply wasn't mentally, cognitively up to the job. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=40.38s)]
*  Everyone knew it then. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Everybody knows it now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=48.0s)]
*  The left lied, the media lied. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=49.18s)]
*  They all covered it up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=51.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, his cabinet was also incredibly incompetent for a variety of reasons. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=52.4s)]
*  Look at Mayorkas for crying out loud. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=57.56s)]
*  Murderers, rapists, known terrorists, cartel members, gang members, Americans murdered, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=59.8s)]
*  raped, victims of violent crime, fentanyl, opioids, transportation secretary, you know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=66.0s)]
*  pothole Pete. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=72.08s)]
*  Keep in mind about pothole Pete, that he is now considered a real contender for the party's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=73.68s)]
*  nomination in 2028. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't know by who, but he was one of the worst transportation secretaries in the history [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=80.72s)]
*  of this country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=85.76s)]
*  Under this guy's watch, America's infrastructure pushed now to a breaking point. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  According to the current transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, quote, Buddha judge didn't lift [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=92.44s)]
*  a finger to fix our air traffic control system. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=97.4s)]
*  It is 50 years old. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=101.4s)]
*  Did they ever hear of modernization? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  Biden, pothole Pete, they've put the safety of every one of you at risk every time you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=105.32s)]
*  got on a commercial flight, any flight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, we are down according to reports, thousands of air traffic controllers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=113.27999999999999s)]
*  There is a shortage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  They never tried to hire people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=120.08s)]
*  Apparently pothole Pete was busy with other important things. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=122.0s)]
*  Let's see, celebrating Transit Equity Day, chairing the Equity Council, stopping racist [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=125.28s)]
*  roads, whatever that means, I don't know, building bike pads and funding studies on [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=131.44000000000003s)]
*  gender nonconforming people. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=136.68s)]
*  Now, there's more. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  According to a fawning long form interview with Wired, Pete also spends his, quote, cognitive [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=140.08s)]
*  powers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=146.68s)]
*  I didn't know he had them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=147.68s)]
*  On reading Iliad and a Norwegian novel titled Spring, while also studying Puritan histiography. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=149.24s)]
*  Apparently roads and bridges and air traffic controllers, you know, were pretty low on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=158.64s)]
*  his priority list. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  And it even gets worse. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=164.27999999999997s)]
*  Pothole Pete was also tasked with implementing Biden's $42 billion rural broadband program. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=165.72s)]
*  In the end, after years of work and billions spent, it connected zero people to the internet. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Nobody thanks to, did they ever not hear of Elon Musk and Starlink? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Ever hear of that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=185.04s)]
*  Now, thanks to Biden and Buttigieg, there was an endless stream of regulations to this [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  project. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=190.28s)]
*  There were lengthy, complex climate mandates, environmental studies, strict DEI, union staffing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=191.28s)]
*  requirements. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  There was a redundant map studies, dozens and dozens of other regulations that made [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  the project totally, completely unworkable. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, get this, Pete Buttigieg has the gall to go on MSDNC and complain about all the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=205.32s)]
*  burdensome regulations in the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=211.28s)]
*  He wrote the book on them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=214.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=216.2s)]
*  The fact that it is so hard to build and do things in this country, and I lived this when [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=217.64s)]
*  I was at the Department of Transportation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=221.72s)]
*  We got 20,000 infrastructure projects done, but we could have done more if it were easier [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  to complete the things that we start in this country and we could have done it more efficiently [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=229.16s)]
*  with our dollar. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=233.32s)]
*  There's a lot of work that needs to be done there too. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=234.32s)]
*  Those were your studies, your regulations, your mandates, and it was your lie that you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=236.92s)]
*  were doing such a great job. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=241.2s)]
*  It's like they lied, the border's closed, the border's secure. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=242.96s)]
*  No, it wasn't. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=245.28s)]
*  Joe is cognitively strong. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=246.28s)]
*  He can outpace almost anybody. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=248.68s)]
*  Pothole Pete did this, a perfect representation of everything that is wrong with big government [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  and the Democratic Party. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XoA1au3COA&t=258.04s)]
