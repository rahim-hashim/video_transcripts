# Newsom points finger at Trump for anti-ICE riots in glitchy video: 'Perilous moment'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q)
*  If you incite violence or destroy our communities, you're going to be held to account. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  That kind of criminal behavior will not be tolerated full stop. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=5.16s)]
*  Already more than 220 people have been arrested, and we're reviewing tapes to build additional [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=8.52s)]
*  cases and people will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=14.08s)]
*  Again, thanks to our law enforcement officers and the majority of Angelenos who protested [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=19.48s)]
*  peacefully, the situation was winding down and was concentrated in just a few square [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=25.52s)]
*  blocks downtown. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=31.36s)]
*  But that's not what Donald Trump wanted. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=33.32s)]
*  He again chose escalation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=36.2s)]
*  It went dead again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=42.32s)]
*  But Mark Wayne Mullen, notice what he does. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=43.92s)]
*  He's blaming Trump. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Law enforcement can't even ask if they're in the country legally. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that's the unbelievable thing to me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=52.44s)]
*  You know, I never fired... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=56.16s)]
*  By the way, he needs a tech operator. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=58.72s)]
*  He does. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=60.96s)]
*  And Sean, I was going to say that I've never fired anybody for making a mistake. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=61.96s)]
*  I fired a lot of people for not admitting he made a mistake. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=64.88s)]
*  Gavin Newsom needs to be fired as governor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  There is no way this guy should be running that state. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, I will tell you this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=72.16s)]
*  I think... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=74.12s)]
*  All right, let's listen to him. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=75.12s)]
*  Let's dip in again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=76.6s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=77.6s)]
*  Trump is pulling a military dragnet all across Los Angeles, well beyond his stated intent [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=78.6s)]
*  to just go after violent and serious criminals. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  His agents are arresting dishwashers, gardeners, day laborers and seamstresses. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  That's just weakness, weakness masquerading as strength. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=93.84s)]
*  Donald Trump's government isn't protecting our communities. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=98.08s)]
*  They're traumatizing our communities. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=101.12s)]
*  And that seems to be the entire point. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=103.28s)]
*  California will keep fighting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=106.44s)]
*  It will keep fighting on behalf of our people, all of our people, including in the courts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=108.0s)]
*  Just yesterday, we filed a legal challenge to Donald Trump's reckless deployment of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  American troops to a major American city. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  Today, we sought an emergency court order to stop the use of the American military to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=121.64s)]
*  engage in law enforcement activities across Los Angeles. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  If some of us could be snatched off the streets without a warrant, based only on suspicion [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=130.96s)]
*  or skin color, then none of us are safe. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=136.32s)]
*  American regimes begin by targeting people who are least able to defend themselves. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=140.56s)]
*  But they do not stop there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=145.4s)]
*  Trump and his loyalists, they thrive on division because it allows them to take more power [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=148.08s)]
*  and exert even more control. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, Trump, he's not opposed to lawlessness and violence as long as it serves [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=155.08s)]
*  him. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=161.12s)]
*  What more evidence do we need than January 6th? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  I ask everyone, take time, reflect on this perilous moment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=166.04s)]
*  A president who wants to be bound by no law or constitution, perpetuating a unified assault [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=171.48s)]
*  on American traditions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a president who in just over 140 days has fired government watchdogs that could [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=180.92s)]
*  hold him accountable, accountable for corruption and fraud. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=186.68s)]
*  He's declared a war, a war on culture, on history, on science, on knowledge itself. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=190.88s)]
*  Databases, quite literally, are vanishing. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=196.68s)]
*  He's delegitimizing news organizations and he's assaulting the First Amendment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  And the threat of defunding them, at threat, he's dictating what universities themselves [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  can teach. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  He's targeting law firms and the judicial branch that are the foundations of an orderly [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=211.44s)]
*  in civil society. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=216.48s)]
*  He's calling for a sitting governor to be arrested for no other reason than to, in his [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=218.24s)]
*  own words, for getting elected. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=223.24s)]
*  And we all know this Saturday, he's ordering our American heroes, the United States military, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=226.52s)]
*  and forcing them to put on a vulgar display to celebrate his birthday, just as other failed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=232.28s)]
*  dictators have done in the past. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=238.88s)]
*  Look, this isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=241.24s)]
*  When Donald Trump sought blanket authority, he made that order apply to every state, in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=245.92s)]
*  this nation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  This is about all of us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  This is about all of us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  This is about me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=256.96s)]
*  Other states are next. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=260.88s)]
*  Other states are next. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=262.24s)]
*  Our next is next. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=263.24s)]
*  Democracy is next. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=264.24s)]
*  Democracy is under assault before our eyes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=265.24s)]
*  We have feared as we have. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=268.24s)]
*  All right, we have apparently more audio problems. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvGE2ZpZD0Q&t=270.59999999999997s)]
