# Sean Hannity breaks down what President Trump's tariffs really mean #shorts #trump #politics #news
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk)
*  The world's free ride is now over. Look at your screen. Here are the new reciprocal tariffs for each country around the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=0.0s)]
*  compared to the tariffs that they already impose on our products, American products. On the blue column, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=7.2s)]
*  well, this is what American businesses faced when trying to enter a foreign market. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=14.16s)]
*  A nearly 40% tax from the European Union. I thought they were our friends. 50% Japan, South Korea, India, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=19.2s)]
*  61% Switzerland, 72% Thailand, 64% Indonesia, Canada. Absolutely screws our dairy farmers and our meat producers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=27.36s)]
*  That's not very neighborly, if you ask me. And the list, we'll keep scrolling. It goes on and on. Make no mistakes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=39.92s)]
*  These are massive, massive taxes and markups designed to make American products uncompetitive. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=46.72s)]
*  They're hurting our ranchers. They're hurting our farmers. They're hurting our manufacturers. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  They're hurting our auto industry. Look, for example, at the top of the list, China's tariff against American imports, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=58.16s)]
*  it's 64%. That's not free and fair trade. And by the way, how is this fair in any way? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=64.72s)]
*  Why are we making China and all these other countries rich? We can make all of these products here in America. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4R4hqNvfk&t=71.68s)]
