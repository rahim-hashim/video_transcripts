# Timeline of Joe Biden's ‘obvious cognitive decline’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ)
*  But tonight, we begin with a story that will not and should not go away for, well, history, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  forever. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=6.96s)]
*  Democrats, their friends in the state-run legacy media mob, they worked in unison to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=7.96s)]
*  cover up Joe Biden's obvious cognitive decline. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  This was a brazen attempt, frankly a conspiracy, to use a phrase, to deceive all of you, to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  deceive the American people. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  They hated Donald Trump so much that they were more than willing to put Americans at [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=26.62s)]
*  risk handing over the keys to our country and our nuclear arsenal to someone that they [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=31.42s)]
*  knew was in a steep cognitive decline. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=36.82s)]
*  Nearly every elected Democrat, every White House official, every Biden family member, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=39.3s)]
*  every single so-called journalist, they lied over and over and over and over again. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=45.3s)]
*  This is the single biggest, most widespread political White House scandal in our lifetime. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=53.18s)]
*  No other way to describe this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  And it was also the dumbest lie ever told. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=61.26s)]
*  They asked all of you not to believe your lion eyes and your lion ears. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=64.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, we simply reported the obvious truth here on this program. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  My humble advice to every American watching tonight is forever, you cannot trust fake [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=74.36s)]
*  CNN, MSDNC. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=80.58s)]
*  You can't trust the broadcast channels, ABC, CBS, NBC. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=82.46s)]
*  Stop reading the New York Times. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=87.1s)]
*  Stop reading the Washington Post. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=89.0s)]
*  Stop listening to NPR. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=91.25999999999999s)]
*  And frankly, you can get your news right here on this show, on Fox News, talk radio, maybe [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=93.58s)]
*  podcasters that you like, know and trust. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=98.74s)]
*  You might not always agree with my political beliefs, but we're not going to spend five [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=101.44s)]
*  years lying to your face. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=106.74s)]
*  We told you the truth about Russia collusion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=108.86s)]
*  They lied. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=111.3s)]
*  We told you the truth about the valuation of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=112.3s)]
*  They lied. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=115.14s)]
*  We told you the truth about Joe Biden's cognitive decline. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=116.14s)]
*  They lied. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=118.98s)]
*  But don't take my word for it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=120.18s)]
*  Let's take a look at the timeline, shall we? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=121.82s)]
*  Let us begin in 2019, the very beginning of Joe Biden's presidential campaign, from the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=123.9s)]
*  very moment that he threw his hat in the ring, something seemed off. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=129.34s)]
*  Let's take a trip down memory lane. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  If you agree with me, go to Joe 30330. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=136.94s)]
*  We choose truth over facts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=143.22s)]
*  Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=145.74s)]
*  Play the radio. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=148.96s)]
*  Make sure the television, excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=149.96s)]
*  Make sure the kids hear words. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=155.74s)]
*  This was not the Vice President Biden that you were all familiar with. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=159.3s)]
*  It was clear. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=164.16s)]
*  It was obvious. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=165.24s)]
*  It was self-evident. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=166.26s)]
*  Joe didn't talk the same. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  He didn't walk the same. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=168.94s)]
*  He didn't look the same. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=169.94s)]
*  Way back in August of 2019, it was obvious to me that Joe Biden was in a decline. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=171.5s)]
*  And that's exactly what we reported right here on this show. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=177.1s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=180.5s)]
*  And while his allies are trying to downplay it, there is a panic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=181.5s)]
*  All Joe being Joe, the verbal mishaps are piling up by the second, raising serious questions [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=185.78s)]
*  among Democrats about his viability. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=192.78s)]
*  Well, let's just put it this way. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=195.46s)]
*  I would argue that David Axelrod is right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=197.06s)]
*  That's probably the best you're going to get out of Sleepy Creepy Uncle Joe. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=199.78s)]
*  He's losing his fastball. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=203.34s)]
*  I am in a little better shape. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=206.3s)]
*  Anyway, unfortunately, anyone who dared to speak the truth was excoriated by the left-wing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=207.86s)]
*  legacy media mob. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=215.02s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=216.5s)]
*  When he was on the stage, the decision he made in the moment was an unsubtle allusion [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=217.5s)]
*  to Alzheimer's or ageism. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=222.18s)]
*  Now, if he thinks that's winning, good luck. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=224.74s)]
*  And if he thinks that the notion that, you know, again, people have talked about Joe [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=228.86s)]
*  Biden's weaknesses as a candidate, if you actually think he's weak, then he'll fall [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=233.94s)]
*  on his own sort of time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=237.86s)]
*  Now, a year later, let's follow the timeline. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  In 2020, the same pattern continued. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  Now, if you are a loyal viewer to this program for any length of time, you are very, very [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=245.94s)]
*  familiar with this alarming moment from then-candidate Joe Biden, you know, created by the thing, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=252.06s)]
*  you know, the thing, God, the creator of everything. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=259.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=263.82s)]
*  It's time for America to get back up on its feet and once again fight for the proposition [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=264.82s)]
*  that we hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=270.42s)]
*  Sounds corny. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=272.54s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=273.54s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=274.54s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=275.62s)]
*  What men and women created by the, you know, the thing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=278.42s)]
*  You know how we talk about it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=282.66s)]
*  Are we the people? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=283.66s)]
*  Corny. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=284.66s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=285.66s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=287.3s)]
*  The thing, the thing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=288.3s)]
*  Once again, we observed the truth and immediately we told you, our viewers, a reminder. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=290.8s)]
*  As a voter, it is fair for every American to ask whether or not this 78-year-old has [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=298.5s)]
*  the strength, the stamina, the focus and the capacity to handle what is by far the toughest [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=305.4s)]
*  job in the world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=310.4s)]
*  Now, to me, quid pro quo Joe seems to be in a rapid state of decline and not up to the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=311.4s)]
*  rigors needed even on a campaign. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=316.17999999999995s)]
*  Now over there on Fake News CNN, the reporting was much different. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=319.84s)]
*  Instead of telling you that the people that watch, the very few people that watch that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  network, well, they spread blatant lies, propaganda, misinformation. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=326.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=332.73999999999995s)]
*  This is Joe Biden out there on a vigorous bike ride. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=334.38s)]
*  Not wearing a helmet, but definitely wearing a mask, by the way. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=338.54s)]
*  Fox's narrative and talk radio's narrative for months has been that Joe Biden is falling [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=342.02s)]
*  apart. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=347.66s)]
*  You just heard Ben Shapiro say it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=348.66s)]
*  Falling apart. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=349.94s)]
*  And there he is riding a bike, out for a bike ride. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=350.94s)]
*  Humpty Dumpty, you want to take that back? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=354.7s)]
*  Don't forget Humpty Dumpty tells everyone he's a reporter, which is another lie. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=358.06s)]
*  None of these people are, quote, journalists, as they claim. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=362.94s)]
*  They are leftist, activist, talk show hosts that are merely part of the democratic machine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=366.34s)]
*  Frankly, nothing more than an extension of their press offices. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  They're not honest about who they are. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=376.62s)]
*  And that brings us to 2021 and our timeline. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  Biden got a year older and his mental condition got even worse. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=382.17999999999995s)]
*  We observed obvious mental fog, too many gaffes to count. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  And to top it all off, Joe barely ever did unscripted press. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=390.82s)]
*  Let me go to Sam, who's going to ask me about the budget. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=394.61999999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's how it went down. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=399.02s)]
*  And he spent most of his weekends in Delaware, could barely even drag his beach chair around. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=400.94s)]
*  But according to MSDNC, competence was at the helm. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=406.5s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  We cannot downplay the comfort that some of us feel in the country, that government is [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=412.14s)]
*  actually working or at least trying to work, that competence is actually at the helm. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=418.62s)]
*  More lies from the state run legacy media mob. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=425.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's go to 2022. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=427.98s)]
*  Joe Biden's decline, it continued. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=431.98s)]
*  Dazed and confused, Joe Biden mumbling, bumbling, stumbling. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=433.42s)]
*  Barely look at this case. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=437.74s)]
*  Get his jacket on without help from Dr. Jill. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=439.5s)]
*  But again, anyone who reported the truth, we were viciously attacked. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=442.86s)]
*  We were accused of ageism. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=446.94s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=449.58000000000004s)]
*  What about the respect for elders thing that we talk about? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=450.86s)]
*  Because we treat, I think, our elderly people not, we don't support them and honor them [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=454.06s)]
*  as much as other countries. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=459.66s)]
*  Is there, and it's a little bit difficult sometimes to talk about these issues and to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=461.1s)]
*  speak of a president that way. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=465.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought that up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  I think one of the biggest challenges we face is ageism, right? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=467.98s)]
*  Fake news, CNN running cover once again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=472.3s)]
*  A year later, 2023, Biden was on MSDNC, and for some reason he just got up and wandered [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=474.7s)]
*  off the set while the show was live on air. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=481.9s)]
*  I'm leaving now. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=486.3s)]
*  Just walked off the set. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=487.34s)]
*  The legacy media mob still lie to your face. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=489.26s)]
*  In fact, CNN continue to blame Biden's lifelong stutter. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=492.7s)]
*  Nobody ever talked about his stutter for his unusual behavior. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=496.53999999999996s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=500.14s)]
*  President Biden does have word finding difficulties. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=501.5s)]
*  He does. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=503.9s)]
*  I mean, we can, whenever, anytime you hear him in a speech, he does them. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=504.7s)]
*  And I don't know if that's his stutter or if that's the prompter. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=508.14s)]
*  He does. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=511.65999999999997s)]
*  And as you know, his critics seize on that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=512.06s)]
*  And this brings us to 2024, Biden's last year as your so-called president. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=515.5s)]
*  Was he really? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=520.38s)]
*  Anyways, most of you know Joe Biden was an utter train wreck. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=521.42s)]
*  He barely worked, took a lot of naps, including during public meetings. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=524.62s)]
*  Let's call a lid at eight o'clock in the morning, meaning you won't see the president [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=528.62s)]
*  for the rest of the day. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=532.22s)]
*  He wandered off, remember, during the G7 meeting in France, while other world leaders [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=533.58s)]
*  anxiously looked on, come on, Joe, let me steer you back to where you belong. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=538.86s)]
*  He also seemed completely lost during a Juneteenth concert, looking off into the distance without, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=543.5s)]
*  you know, with a thousand-yard stare of his. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=549.9000000000001s)]
*  At one point in 2024, he even walked straight into a jungle during a trip to Latin America. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=552.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to go for a walk. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=559.98s)]
*  You know, I mean, we showed you all of this very real footage. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=561.42s)]
*  Remember, you would shake air, and you didn't know whether to go exit left or exit right. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=565.66s)]
*  You had no idea. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=569.5799999999999s)]
*  Somebody would have to, oh, come on, Joe, we'll walk you off the stage. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=570.2199999999999s)]
*  You know, we would show you this footage day in, day out, night in, night out, while the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  other media outlets accused us of producing what they call cheap fake videos. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=579.5799999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=584.86s)]
*  We were hearing about so-called cheap fakes. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=585.42s)]
*  It's playing out on right-wing media, Fox, New York Post, and so on. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=588.38s)]
*  And all of this is to try to make the case that Biden is slipping, he's confused, and so on. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=592.9399999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of videos going around about President Biden on social media. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=598.06s)]
*  Which ones are real? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=601.26s)]
*  Which ones are deceptively edited, now being called cheap fakes? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=602.3s)]
*  A lot of memes and what the White House is calling cheap fakes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=606.22s)]
*  Cheap fakes are a little bit simpler. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=611.74s)]
*  They're cheap. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=613.34s)]
*  They're just distorted, out-of-context videos, chopped up in certain ways, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=613.98s)]
*  constructed in certain ways. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=618.06s)]
*  That's what we're seeing. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=619.3399999999999s)]
*  That's what the Biden administration, the Biden campaign is so worried about right now. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=620.2199999999999s)]
*  That's June of 24th. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=624.6199999999999s)]
*  They had four long years to figure out what we figured out in 2019. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=626.78s)]
*  And it gets worse. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=632.14s)]
*  March of 2024, liberal Joe, our old friend, proclaiming Joe Biden was his best self, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=633.66s)]
*  intellectually, analytically. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=640.3s)]
*  What planet is he living on? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=645.3399999999999s)]
*  Start your tape right now, because I'm about to tell you the truth. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=646.86s)]
*  And f you if you can't handle the truth. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=650.6999999999999s)]
*  This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=654.78s)]
*  Not a close second. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=663.66s)]
*  And I've known him for years. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  The Brzezinski's have known him for 50 years. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=666.3s)]
*  If it weren't the truth, I wouldn't say it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=669.02s)]
*  Hey, Joe, I could use your words. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=673.42s)]
*  F you for lying, lying to the American people. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=675.58s)]
*  Even after Biden's disastrous debate performance in 2024, there was still some on fake news CNN [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=679.1800000000001s)]
*  making excuses for Joe until he was officially out of the presidential race. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=686.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=691.74s)]
*  In several events since the CNN debate, President Biden has appeared vigorous. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=693.0200000000001s)]
*  He has had a really busy, jam-packed schedule where you haven't seen [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=698.14s)]
*  what we all saw on the debate stage. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=704.22s)]
*  He never had a jam-packed schedule. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=708.78s)]
*  My big question is tonight, if Democrats, their friends in the state-run legacy media mob [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=710.7s)]
*  are willing to lie so blatantly about all of this, what won't they lie about? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=717.18s)]
*  As it turns out, their rampant dishonesty extends to almost everything. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=722.38s)]
*  I don't have time to list every lie. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=727.9s)]
*  They have done nothing but lie and lie again and again and peddle one conspiracy theory [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=730.46s)]
*  about Donald Trump after another, and they even got Pulitzer Prizes for lying, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=735.98s)]
*  and they won't give him back. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=741.66s)]
*  It's repulsive. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=743.34s)]
*  It is corrupt. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=744.62s)]
*  It is the biggest presidential scandal in history. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=745.98s)]
*  Well, right up there. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=750.3s)]
*  Here's one quick example. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=751.98s)]
*  This is fake Jake Tapper defending Hunter Biden in 2019, 20 and 23. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=753.18s)]
*  Now he's criticizing him. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=757.9s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=759.1s)]
*  Whatever you think of Hunter Biden—and there's certainly a lot of people in this town, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=760.54s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans, that do not think a lot of him—there is a certain kind of [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=763.98s)]
*  cruelty to the campaign against him. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=769.26s)]
*  Where is Hunter? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=771.34s)]
*  Where is Hunter? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=771.98s)]
*  Where is Hunter? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=772.62s)]
*  The right wing is going crazy with all sorts of allegations about Biden and his family. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=773.58s)]
*  Too disgusting to even repeat here. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=779.18s)]
*  Some of the ones I've seen from the president's son and some of the president's supporters are [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=783.1s)]
*  wildly unhinged. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=788.9399999999999s)]
*  I think that you came here and leveled a bunch of accusations and allegations about Hunter Biden. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=790.38s)]
*  I didn't level—I just said the facts. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=796.46s)]
*  Now, that was before Biden's exit from public life. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=799.42s)]
*  Now here's fake Jake admitting the truth. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=802.62s)]
*  He's trying to make money selling a book. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=806.9399999999999s)]
*  I think Hunter was driving the decision making for the family in a way that people—he was [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=808.46s)]
*  almost like a chief of staff of the family. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=814.14s)]
*  Does that strike you as pretty bizarre? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=816.14s)]
*  It's bizarre because I think he is provably, demonstrably unethical, sleazy, and prone to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=818.38s)]
*  horrible decisions. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=825.34s)]
*  Tell me how you really feel. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=826.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, I just look at the record. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=828.78s)]
*  I mean, after his brother died, he cheated on his wife with his brother's widow and then [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=831.74s)]
*  got her addicted to crack. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=835.9s)]
*  That's just one thing I could say. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=837.66s)]
*  I mean, I don't have a lot of personal regard for him. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=839.34s)]
*  And I have no personal regard for you either, fake Jake. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=844.9399999999999s)]
*  You're trying to make money criticizing the very lying that you were a huge part of. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=849.5s)]
*  Why would anyone buy that book or trust anyone at fake news CNN ever, ever again? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=853.74s)]
*  They pretend to be honest, purveyors of truth, and that is a lie. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=860.54s)]
*  But of course, it's not just the media. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=865.3399999999999s)]
*  As Peter Ducey can report firsthand, then-Biden White House at that time was a house of cards, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  built on lies and smears. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=874.7s)]
*  He's the only one I recall calling it out regularly. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=876.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=879.6600000000001s)]
*  President Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=880.94s)]
*  Why does White House staff treat him like a baby? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsySL_MHtpQ&t=884.3000000000001s)]
