# This should scare the hell out of every American: Tom Homan
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA)
*  Joining us now, Borders are, Tom Homan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=0.0s)]
*  Tom, let's get your first reaction, your first public comments on this issue out in Colorado. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=2.52s)]
*  You know, me and you have been talking about this for years, Sean. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=7.76s)]
*  I mean, I worked for the network just before I came back to the second Trump administration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=13.52s)]
*  And I've said over and over again, you know, what scares me about the southern border, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=18.48s)]
*  the sex trafficking, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Sky high. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=23.96s)]
*  The Americans dying from Fentanyl. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  The people, you know, all the drugs coming across, all the sex trafficking, all the smuggling. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=28.0s)]
*  And I said what concerned me the most was they created the biggest national security [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=35.28s)]
*  vulnerability this country has ever seen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=40.44s)]
*  Not only did two million known gotaways, two million people cross the border, we don't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=42.68s)]
*  know who they are, where they came from, we don't know where they are now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=47.44s)]
*  On top of that, even through the legal process, the Biden administration were bringing people [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=50.36s)]
*  unvetted, handing out work fees like they're candy while they sat here and planned something [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=55.0s)]
*  bad. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=61.64s)]
*  We are going to be dealing with this for the next 10 years because of the chaos they created [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=62.64s)]
*  in four years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=67.44s)]
*  We're out there kicking butt. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=68.44s)]
*  We're arresting a lot of criminal aliens. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=70.0s)]
*  We're out there looking for the bad guy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=72.0s)]
*  And when we're out there doing that, Sean, we've got protesters assaulting ICE officers. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=73.88s)]
*  We've got members of Congress all over the country going to ICE facilities, raising hell, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  saying this is your oversight responsibility. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=84.0s)]
*  Where were those oversight responsibility when 10.5 million illegal aliens came across [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=85.32s)]
*  the border? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=89.84s)]
*  Where is the oversight responsibility on releasing over 8 million illegal aliens to this country? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=90.84s)]
*  Where is the oversight responsibility then? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=95.72s)]
*  This is attack on ICE. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=97.32s)]
*  This is attack on the Trump administration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=98.8s)]
*  We're trying to fix the damage done by Biden. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=100.72s)]
*  You're doing a great job. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=104.48s)]
*  And this was the most preventable national security threat I would argue in history. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=105.92s)]
*  I have annoyingly asked you the question over and over again. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=111.36s)]
*  When you have known terrorists and murderers and rapists and cartel members and gang members [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=114.68s)]
*  in the country, and you have them, you know, 12 million, 15 million, 20 million, nobody [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=118.64s)]
*  knows the actual number, and what did we learn from 9-11-01? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=124.6s)]
*  They were at war with us. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  We were not at war with them, the 9-11 Commission report. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=130.04s)]
*  They're plotting, planning and scheming. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=133.6s)]
*  This is a terror attack. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=135.86s)]
*  I'm worried about the big terror attack. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=137.52s)]
*  And of course, my prayers, my thoughts, my sympathies go out to the victims here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=139.84s)]
*  But do you not agree that if we don't find these people soon, that we are at risk of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=144.96s)]
*  a 9-11 or worse? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=154.4s)]
*  I mean, why did 10—why did 2 million illegal aliens pay more to get away? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=155.4s)]
*  They could have paid half of what they paid, crossed the border, turned themselves into [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  a border agent, get released that same day, get a free airline ticket to the city of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=166.72s)]
*  their choice, get a free hotel room, get three meals a day, plus free medical care and work [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=170.6s)]
*  authorization. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=175.6s)]
*  2 million people paid more to get away. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=176.6s)]
*  They didn't want to be vetted. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  They didn't want to be fingerprinted. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  This scares the hell out of me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  I've been doing this for 40 years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  It should have scared the hell out of every American what the Biden administration did. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=186.16s)]
*  This 2 million known Godaways scares the hell out of me. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=189.94s)]
*  So I'm convinced something's coming, unless we can find them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  They've come—they came from over 200 countries. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=197.04s)]
*  We don't know how many. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  We know there are terrorists here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you've taken on Mission Impossible as great a job as you're doing, but to find [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=203.72s)]
*  every single one of them? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=209.44s)]
*  I don't know how you do it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fox_2vlf_PA&t=212.16s)]
