# This could be ‘FAR WORSE’ than Watergate, says Hannity
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0)
*  Welcome to Hannity and tonight Democrats, their friends and the state-run legacy media [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=0.0s)]
*  mob, they were wrong again. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=7.82s)]
*  Another anti-Trump smear is now poof. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=9.94s)]
*  It's up in smoke despite their doom and gloom predictions about Donald Trump and the economy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=12.82s)]
*  Oh, sad news. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=18.1s)]
*  Second quarter growth is now slated to smash all expectations. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=20.18s)]
*  The Atlanta Fed predicting a whopping 6.6% growth in the second quarter. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=24.86s)]
*  At the same time, job creation way up in the country, wages are up, inflation, oh, it's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=31.78s)]
*  at the Fed's benchmark of 2.1. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=38.1s)]
*  Well, they won 2.0, one-tenth of 1% off. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=41.26s)]
*  In other words, President Donald Trump is keeping his word. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=44.7s)]
*  The state-run legacy media mob, they look stupid, they look foolish. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Once again, the punditry class, forget it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=51.7s)]
*  They're absolutely useless, which is why nobody watches them anymore. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=53.94s)]
*  We've got all the details coming up in a few minutes and polling numbers that you're [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=57.739999999999995s)]
*  going to want to see as well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  Also tonight, left-leaning statistician Nate Silver, out with new data, backs up something [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=63.4s)]
*  we have known on this program for a long time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=69.12s)]
*  The Democratic Party is dominated by, well, mentally unwell Americans. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  Hmm, Hannity's calling Democrats mentally unwell. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=78.06s)]
*  No, Nate Silver is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=81.7s)]
*  We'll tell you what he said. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=83.14s)]
*  And just when you think the Democratic Party cannot get any more unhinged, think again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=84.74s)]
*  Coming up, we're going to bring you the latest edition of Timmy Wall's, Uncle Timmy's, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=89.66s)]
*  investigation into young male voters. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=94.25999999999999s)]
*  This guy cannot be any more wrong on his analysis of what happened in November of last year. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=97.56s)]
*  But first, this could be the biggest political scandal in American presidential history. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I believe it's the biggest scandal in presidential history and White [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=108.5s)]
*  House history. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=112.58s)]
*  Tonight, the Department of Justice has officially opened a major investigation into the Biden [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=113.58s)]
*  administration's prolific use of the auto pen, especially during Biden's final days [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=118.46s)]
*  in office. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=124.5s)]
*  Let me make a prediction here tonight. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=125.5s)]
*  There are people that will be in a lot of trouble before this is all said and done. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=127.9s)]
*  In fact, out of the scores of Biden's last minute pardons, only one appeared to be physically [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=131.94s)]
*  signed by Joe Biden. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=137.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=140.12s)]
*  When you look at these last minute Biden pardons, the big ones, Biden siblings, Fauci, January [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  6th committee, most of the big ones have the same very neat signature. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=148.32s)]
*  We would expect that probably to be the auto pen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=153.44s)]
*  There is one that looks different. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=156.76s)]
*  It looks authentic. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=160.44s)]
*  In fact, if you look at the last name, it almost looks like the president was having [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=161.44s)]
*  a hard time spelling his last name there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=164.44s)]
*  Is this White House of the opinion that the only pardon that would count is one that the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=167.2s)]
*  president signed himself? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=172.92s)]
*  But not Joe Biden. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=173.92s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=174.92s)]
*  Very interesting props if you want to bring them to my office later so I can take a closer [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=175.92s)]
*  look. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=179.92s)]
*  I would like to do that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=180.92s)]
*  The president is making a good point when he discusses the usage of the auto pen. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=182.44s)]
*  Who was running the country for the past four years? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  Perhaps those documents were signed with the auto pen, something that I believe the Department [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=190.28s)]
*  of Justice is looking into. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=195.44s)]
*  As you saw, Ed Martin made an announcement at the Department of Justice this morning [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=196.92s)]
*  to launch an investigation because the American people deserve answers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=200.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=204.6s)]
*  That certainly doesn't look good, does it? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=205.84s)]
*  Now, as a reminder, multiple presidents, they have directed staff to use the auto pen to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=207.44s)]
*  sign official documents. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=212.52s)]
*  But the key word here is directed. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=214.0s)]
*  Past presidents directed their staff to use the auto pen, typically when they were out [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=217.32s)]
*  of town. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=222.4s)]
*  Now, does anyone on either side of the aisle or in the state-run legacy media mob actually [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=223.44s)]
*  believe Joe Biden was capable of directing his staff to do anything in those final days [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=228.32s)]
*  when they thought they'd run him for reelection and just prove, bring out proof of life occasionally [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=233.96s)]
*  if he won again? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=240.84s)]
*  It was the other way around. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=242.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=243.72s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm going to get in trouble with staff. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=244.72s)]
*  I don't do this the right way. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=247.24s)]
*  I'm going to get in trouble with my staff. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=251.52s)]
*  I pretend that you didn't answer me. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=252.56s)]
*  Am I allowed to take any questions? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=254.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=256.56s)]
*  Anybody here who's that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=259.56s)]
*  You know, I thought when I got to be president I'd get to do things that I wanted to do, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=261.56s)]
*  but my staff tells me what I can't do. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, remember? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  They controlled every aspect of the president's life. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  The president of our country is the only person with the power to issue federal pardons, sign [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=272.92s)]
*  executive orders, and sign bills into law. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=278.92s)]
*  And he can do it with his hand or he can order the use of the auto pen, but it must come [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  from the president, not a cabal of weird advisors who make decisions behind the scenes while [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=287.88s)]
*  Biden is napping every day pretty much all day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  So let's be clear. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=296.55999999999995s)]
*  This is a very real, credible allegation from multiple sources, including the new book from [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=298.2s)]
*  the very low rated fake Jake Tapper at Fake News CNN. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=305.4s)]
*  We focused on all the evidence, our own observations. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=309.84s)]
*  It was obvious, transparent. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=312.84s)]
*  It was clear. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=314.76s)]
*  We pointed it out first in 2019 that Biden was mentally incompetent and president in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=315.92s)]
*  name only while his senior advisors were running the country by committee. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=322.24s)]
*  This is a massive security threat and was a security threat to our country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=328.18s)]
*  It raises serious questions about whether Biden even knew the auto pen was being used. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=333.26s)]
*  If that is the case, none of his auto pen signatures are valid. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=339.11999999999995s)]
*  None of the pardons are legal. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  And his senior advisors, that would mean they broke the law, violated the constitution in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=345.11999999999995s)]
*  very serious ways. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=350.32s)]
*  If true, this would be far worse than Watergate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=351.56s)]
*  So tonight there are two key questions that must be answered. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  Was Biden mentally unable to perform the duties of the White House? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  The answer to me seems obvious. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=363.55999999999995s)]
*  And two, did he fully know and understand what the auto pen was actually signing? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v85Uc0eGO0&t=365.2s)]
