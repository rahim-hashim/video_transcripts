# Behind Trump's wins on the economy as inflation cools
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk)
*  So, despite endless hysteria from the left, the Trump economy is booming. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=0.0s)]
*  In April, job openings rose to a shocking 7.4 million. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=4.08s)]
*  Inflation fell more than expected to just 2.1 percent. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=10.98s)]
*  Oh, that's the lowest number in years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=15.08s)]
*  Oh, that's the Fed's magic number to lower interest rates. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=17.52s)]
*  Oh, Jerome Powell, I hope you're watching. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=20.6s)]
*  Time to lower interest rates. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=23.04s)]
*  And on top of all this positive news, the Atlanta Fed, highly respected, now projecting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=24.56s)]
*  second quarter GDP growth, will reach a staggering 4.6 percent. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=30.0s)]
*  Now, with President Trump securing one victory after another, it is no surprise his approval [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=35.12s)]
*  rating is soaring. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=40.08s)]
*  Look at this new Trafalgar. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  That's Robert Cahaly, his poll out today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  Trump is eight points above water with an approval rating of nearly 54 percent. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=45.14s)]
*  And that's following his historic Middle East trip. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=50.0s)]
*  An insider advantage poll had his approval at 55 percent, 11 points on the positive side. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=52.64s)]
*  Here with more, pollster Matt Towery, co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, Steve [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=59.32s)]
*  Moore. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=64.44s)]
*  All right, before we get to the polls, let's go to you, Steve. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=65.44s)]
*  Four point six percent, ten trillion dollars in money committed for manufacturing investment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=68.52s)]
*  for automobiles, pharmaceuticals, semiconductor trips, ten trillion dollars. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=74.84s)]
*  I've never seen that in my lifetime. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=79.92s)]
*  The largest tax cuts in history, assuming the one big beautiful bill gets passed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=81.96s)]
*  Oh, and he's looking out for hardworking men and women, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  and seniors, no tax on Social Security. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=91.05999999999999s)]
*  And he's not touching Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  So the question is, what happens next? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=97.82s)]
*  Because Reagan cut taxes and he doubled revenues to the government. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=101.36s)]
*  Well, Sean, this is an amazing story. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=105.32s)]
*  It didn't happen by accident. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=110.92s)]
*  By the way, doesn't seem just like about a month ago, the media was saying we're headed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=112.58s)]
*  to a second Great Depression because of Donald Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=116.78s)]
*  So it's been an amazing turnaround. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  And I would attribute this to three factors. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=121.86s)]
*  Number one, you've got a pro-business president, a pro-America pro-business president. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=125.04s)]
*  And that is a very reassuring thing for America's small businesses and our employers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=130.02s)]
*  Number two, you've got this big tax cut that is like rocket fuel for the economy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=136.68s)]
*  And Donald Trump is going to get this done. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  And I want to salute Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, who got that through the House. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=142.88s)]
*  Now the Senate has to do their job. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=147.52s)]
*  Now, do I love that bill? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't love it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=150.24s)]
*  But it's extremely important for the economy that they get this done. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=151.36s)]
*  And then third of all, and as you know, Sean, I'm not a big fan of the tariffs that Trump [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=155.32s)]
*  has put in place, but he is one after another after another getting these trade deals done. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=159.84s)]
*  And that has had a very positive impact on the overall economy and the market. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=165.16s)]
*  So this is a beautiful picture right now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=169.84s)]
*  It's almost like Donald Trump, think about this, since COVID hit, you know, the American [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=172.82s)]
*  economy has been kind of in a slumber. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  It's been kind of comatose. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  And all of a sudden, it's almost like the animal spirits of the economy have reawoken, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=183.5s)]
*  awakened. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=188.16s)]
*  And I love this picture. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=189.16s)]
*  I just think it's fantastic. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=190.72s)]
*  You know, last night, Matt Towery, we played fake news CNN and their poll guy, freaking [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  out because the Democratic numbers were so bad. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=198.5s)]
*  You have Donald Trump plus 11, 55, 44. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  And that's prior to this real big economic news. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=206.94s)]
*  You're very well aware of how credible the Atlanta Fed is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=211.5s)]
*  You used to be a state legislator in the state of Georgia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=214.66s)]
*  This is a big deal to me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=218.82s)]
*  $10 trillion in manufacturing commitments is a lot of money. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=220.8s)]
*  That's a lot of high paying career jobs. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  And I didn't mention we're going to become energy dominant. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=226.72s)]
*  That's another big factor. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know, years ago, I wrote a book called News Vest, it was about how you could [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  take opinion and news and invest. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=235.28s)]
*  A little harder under Donald Trump because the news cycle changes every 15 minutes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=237.28s)]
*  But things are really going well with the economy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=241.8s)]
*  You can feel it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=243.96s)]
*  And I think the average American realizes it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=244.96s)]
*  Those who are on Main Street. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=247.9s)]
*  It's Wall Street and the media that are the problem. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=249.56s)]
*  Wall Street is fixated on these tariffs and the media is fixated on reporting the negative [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=252.16s)]
*  side of those tariffs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  Most people aren't feeling that inflation because it's going down. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=258.88s)]
*  Most people are not upset with Trump's policies. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=262.48s)]
*  They know he's making progress. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=264.8s)]
*  They have a general feeling that things are going well. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=265.8s)]
*  I'll add this, Robert Kaley nor I, neither one of us really poll issues all that much. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=268.88s)]
*  So we haven't polled the economy. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=274.24s)]
*  But I know one thing about Robert's polling and our polling and insider advantage. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=275.68s)]
*  That is if we have Trump at 54 or 55 or 56, he's at least there or higher because we do [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=279.08s)]
*  not miss when it comes to polling Donald Trump. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=284.92s)]
*  You got it right in 2016, 2020, 2024, both of you with inflation at the Fed's magic number [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=288.48s)]
*  of two point. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=295.12s)]
*  Well, it's really two percent. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=296.12s)]
*  There are two point one percent. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=297.6s)]
*  What possible excuse can Chairman Powell give at this point, Steve Moore, not to lower interest [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=299.56s)]
*  rates unless it's political? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=306.72s)]
*  I would imagine a full basis point would not be out of the question or, you know, point [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=309.88s)]
*  five, oh, basis point reduction in interest rates. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=315.12s)]
*  That would be great for the economy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=318.56s)]
*  It seems like every other indicator would support that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=320.04s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=323.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=324.2s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's an overall beautiful picture. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=325.2s)]
*  It really is. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=327.4s)]
*  And, you know, when you look at the consumer confidence numbers, they're great. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=328.4s)]
*  One of the one of the most important statistics that came out in that Atlanta Fed report, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=331.76s)]
*  which brought a big smile on my face and Larry Kudlow's Larry Kudlow talks about this all [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=336.52s)]
*  the time on Fox Business News, is businesses are investing like crazy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's like they're opening up the spigots. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  They're so confident in the economy right now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  So should the Fed be lowering rates right now? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=350.64s)]
*  I would give it another month or so. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=353.84s)]
*  Let's see what happens with inflation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=355.79999999999995s)]
*  The only thing that could really disrupt this picture is if we saw, you know, a new eruption [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  of inflation. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  But I don't want to let the genie out of that bottle. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=364.6s)]
*  So I'm kind of pause now. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=367.24s)]
*  Let's see what happens in a month or two. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=369.26000000000005s)]
*  And then if we continue to have that low inflation, lower rates, by the way, that'll be great [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=371.12s)]
*  for our budget situation because think of this, Sean, the cost of borrowing, we're the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=375.42s)]
*  biggest borrower in the world, will decline and that will reduce the deficit. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=380.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=384.44s)]
*  You know, look, there are unpredictable things that will happen in any presidency. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=385.44s)]
*  The president has taken on big issues like trying to create peace in Europe, peace in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=391.16s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  We don't know what the Iranians will do, for example. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=397.04s)]
*  That is a big unknown for most people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=399.8s)]
*  The president was very clear that they're not allowed to enrich. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  He put that out on a truth post earlier today. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiXAYtPIaTk&t=404.72s)]
