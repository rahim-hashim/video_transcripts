# Karoline Leavitt: This shows how 'deranged' the Democratic Party has become
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ)
*  Here now with reaction it is time for the Hannity press briefing with White House press secretary Caroline Leavitt boy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Very powerful. Well, I think actually all of your press briefings are pretty powerful because I love watching the liberal media melt and bubble and fizz [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=8.42s)]
*  Like alcohol salts and water but it was it was powerful [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=16.04s)]
*  We had Patty Rachel's mom on this show last night and what she said at that podium today was extremely powerful [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=19.02s)]
*  Which is why I assume you decided you know what that's enough for the for today. I think that speaks for itself [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=26.3s)]
*  What was that like for you? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=32.74s)]
*  It was incredibly difficult Sean to stand beside Patty [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=35.38s)]
*  Moran a mother who has [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=40.3s)]
*  Experienced every mother's worst nightmare and it was incredibly powerful to listen to her words because they are the truth [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=42.82s)]
*  The brutal truth about what happened to her beautiful daughter at the hands of a heinous monster [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=49.94s)]
*  Who should have never been allowed into our country in the first place and? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=56.1s)]
*  Patty was so courageous and brave to share the gruesome details about her daughter's murder and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=61.42s)]
*  Thank goodness our justice system [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=67.98s)]
*  Convicted this illegal alien criminal murderer of the heinous killing of Patty's daughter [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=70.9s)]
*  And I was so honored to stand beside her today and it speaks to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  Just the she also spoke to just the lack of common sense by today's modern-day Democrat party because you have a senator in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=80.86000000000001s)]
*  Maryland who is supposed to serve his constituents including Patty Moran and Rachel Moran and their family and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=89.14000000000001s)]
*  Instead he is spending more time [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=96.94000000000001s)]
*  Wasting taxpayer dollars flying to a foreign country and an attempt to bring back an illegal criminal alien [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=100.32s)]
*  foreign terrorist gang member [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=107.56s)]
*  Then he ever gave the time to Patty Moran and her mourning family over the loss of his constituent [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=110.08s)]
*  This shows you how deranged the modern-day Democrat party has truly become and we are incredibly grateful for Patty for her [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=116.72s)]
*  Willingness and her request to share her story at the White House briefing room today [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=124.44s)]
*  Well, we see that they're silent when we see these acts of domestic terrorism against Tesla [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=128.8s)]
*  We see that the Democratic Party is now the party of championing the right of men to play women's sports [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=134.84s)]
*  putting the rights of the illegals over the safety of Americans [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=140.36s)]
*  screaming bloody murder and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=144.36s)]
*  That we're experiencing a constitutional crisis if we cut out waste fraud and abuse and corruption [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=146.4s)]
*  That is the party that they now represent. That's fine. If that's where they want to be [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=153.56s)]
*  Do we have an update? I know that there was discussions today regarding trade and terrorists with Japan [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=158.24s)]
*  I expect that probably a lot of countries are gonna be signing deals in the days and weeks ahead. Can you update us? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=163.6s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I don't have an update for you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=171.04s)]
*  I actually just left a dinner with the president and Patty Moran and some great faith leaders in celebration of Holy Week [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=173.48s)]
*  So I haven't checked in with our Secretary of Treasury or a Jameson Greer our United States trade ambassador yet [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=179.24s)]
*  However, I did run into the Secretary of Treasury and he told me the meetings were productive and they were moving along and they were [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=184.96s)]
*  Here for quite some time and the president met directly with one of the trade representatives from Japan because the president wants to be involved in [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=191.6s)]
*  These negotiations and these talks and I think it speaks volumes about the number of countries [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=199.08s)]
*  We have seen come to the table reaching out to this administration to cut deals [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  It's because the entire world knows they need to do business with the United States of America and China knows that too [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=208.36s)]
*  Sean and as President Trump directed me to say yesterday it remains true tonight. The ball is in China's court [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=214.68s)]
*  They need to do business with the United States [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=220.6s)]
*  they need the best thing on the face of the planet and that is the American consumer and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=222.72s)]
*  We have we are the best place in the world to do business [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=228.32s)]
*  The rest of the world knows that and that's why Japan was here today to negotiate a trade deal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=231.12s)]
*  It's kind of a simple concept if a country wants free and fair trade or if they want to put tariffs on us on us [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  They'll have reciprocal tariffs. It doesn't seem that complicated [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=242.56s)]
*  And if they're gonna put barriers up to products being sold in their country [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=246.84s)]
*  We'll do the same back to them [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=250.94s)]
*  If they don't want to do it then it'll be really free and fair trade and and that would be something that has not happened [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  For in our country in what? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=258.52s)]
*  50 years 60 years [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=261.32s)]
*  Anyway, Caroline Levitt. We appreciate you being with us somebody we say on radio smack down with a smile [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83AN4nVGmKQ&t=263.76s)]
