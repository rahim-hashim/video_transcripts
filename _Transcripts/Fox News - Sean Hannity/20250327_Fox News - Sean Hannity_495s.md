# 'Selfless warrior' Elise Stefanik gives inside look at decision to stay in Congress
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ)
*  Congresswoman Elise Stefanik joins me with more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, you know, a lot of people praising your action today as selfless, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=3.44s)]
*  as really heroic for the agenda of President Trump. I want to pull up this razor-thin House [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=8.08s)]
*  majority. This is what we were looking at here. 218 to 215 is the narrow majority—218 to 213, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=13.36s)]
*  rather—which means Republicans can only lose two votes on any given piece of legislation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  A senior White House official told our Peter Ducey that when you look at this, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=27.2s)]
*  this seat that you are in could have been vacant for most of the year. We don't have time to waste. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  They were referring to Governor Kathy Hochul, who is no friend of the Trump administration and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=37.6s)]
*  would like to hold your seat open as long as possible. There were a lot of political [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=42.24s)]
*  realities at play, and I'm hoping you can take me behind the scenes into exactly how this transpired [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=46.16s)]
*  and what the thought process was. Well, thank you, Kayleigh. First of all, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=51.68s)]
*  I was honored to have earned that nomination by President Trump, and I'm proud to be one of his [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=55.6s)]
*  top allies on Capitol Hill. This goes back to fighting against the witch hunt impeachment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=59.92s)]
*  It goes back to being the first member of Congress who endorsed him, as well as leading the charge [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=64.56s)]
*  in so many ways to combat anti-Semitism, which, of course, he is taking action on today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=69.28s)]
*  I know the stakes as an elected representative for New York's 21st District and as a previous [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=74.8s)]
*  member of leadership in the House, that we need to secure the border, cut taxes, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=79.6s)]
*  unleash American energy independence and deliver these historic results on behalf of the president [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=84.88s)]
*  because of this tremendous mandate that the American people gave him. So I have been proud [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  to be a team player. The president knows that. He and I had multiple conversations today, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  and we are committed to delivering results on behalf of the American people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=99.84s)]
*  And as always, I'm committed to delivering results on behalf of my constituents. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=104.0s)]
*  What was the timeline on this? Did this all transpire today? Was it a long and thought-out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=110.24s)]
*  conversation? There's a lot of factors. There's, of course, the key election in Florida on Tuesday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=114.08s)]
*  There's Kathy Hochul's part in this. There's the notion that your seat has an open—does not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  have an open primary. So there's a lot of factors. What was the timeline of this? Was this a quick [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=123.6s)]
*  decision or one that was long and thought out? Well, as you know, Kayleigh, I have been—I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=128.88s)]
*  had my hearing the day after the inauguration. The hearing went incredibly smoothly. It passed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=133.76s)]
*  by voice, and there's been universal praise for the nomination. The reality is, as Democrats, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=137.76s)]
*  as we see in New York state, it is totally corrupt. Kathy Hochul started threatening to move the ball [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=142.72s)]
*  on the election date. You see a highly, highly politicized, radical left trying to do everything [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=148.32s)]
*  they can to defeat the president. And this is about stepping up as a team. And I am doing that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  as a leader to ensure that we can take hold of this mandate and deliver these historic results, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=158.72s)]
*  that we can pass this reconciliation bill, which will have tax cuts. It will have border security, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=164.4s)]
*  American energy independence. And importantly, I look forward to continuing to hold higher [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=169.84s)]
*  education accountable for their failures, as well as all of my work on the House Armed Services [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=174.72s)]
*  Committee and in the national security space that I have been known for at the highest levels in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=179.76s)]
*  Congress. So it really came to a culmination today, but it was a combination of the New York [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=184.24s)]
*  corruption that we're seeing under Kathy Hochul, special elections and the House margin. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=188.88s)]
*  And look, I've been in a House. It's tough to count these votes every day. And we are going to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=193.52s)]
*  continue to defy the political prognosticators and deliver victory on behalf of President Trump, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  and importantly, the voters across this country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  Congresswoman, you were the first congresswoman—or congressman, first member, I should say—to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=207.84s)]
*  endorse President Trump for president. I remember when I was press secretary, he called you a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=213.52s)]
*  Republican star. You showed that to be the case in the anti-Semitism hearings, where you were [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  responsible for some of these presidents stepping aside. You've been instrumental [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=222.64s)]
*  to this party, a warrior for the party. House Speaker Mike Johnson had this to say [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=227.2s)]
*  about you today. We'll pull this up here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=231.6s)]
*  Today's selfless decision shows America what those of us who work with Elise already know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  She's deeply devoted to her country, fully committed to see President Trump's agenda succeed [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=238.88s)]
*  in Congress. I will invite her to return to the leadership table immediately. Your old-spot GOP [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  conference chair is taken by Lisa McLean. What do you think your new leadership position will [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=249.92s)]
*  look like? Do you even know yet? You know, I'm going to continue speaking out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  The good news, Kayleigh, is because I am not pending confirmation, the American people will [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=258.24s)]
*  be hearing a lot more from me, because you're limited in what you can say when you are pending [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=262.32s)]
*  confirmation. So I'm glad to have joined Fox today, as I will continue to do, and just look [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=266.56s)]
*  forward to sharing my voice, as I always have, being one of the top fighters and top allies on [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  behalf of President Trump and behalf of the American people and on behalf of my district, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=276.88s)]
*  standing up for our principles to make sure that we have a strong economy, a secure border, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=282.0s)]
*  strong national security, and that we are unified as a team to deliver historic results. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=287.36s)]
*  You know, President Trump, I noticed in his true social today, where he very much praised you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=294.24s)]
*  and your efforts for the party, he said this at the very end, I look forward to the day when Elise [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=298.4s)]
*  is able to join my administration in the future. It sounds like he has a spot for you down the line. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=303.36s)]
*  Can you even put your mind there? I mean, four years is a long time. There's going to be a lot [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  of turnover, a lot of spots that open. Elise? Well, the president is going to continue to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  deliver just incredible results. He has had a nearly perfect first few months and has just [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  done a tremendous job on delivering what he campaigned on. And I was proud to be by his [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=325.76s)]
*  side campaigning all across the country, making sure we held this House majority, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=331.12s)]
*  specifically focus on fighting back against the politicization and the illegal weaponization of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  the witch hunts stemming from New York state. I will continue to do that. He knows that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=340.48s)]
*  And I look forward to continuing to serve in different ways. And, Kayleigh, while I've been [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  in the House quite a long time, I, you know, am proud to still be one of the youngest members, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=349.44s)]
*  although I'm very happy that there are younger ones, too. But this will be my 11th year in the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=354.24s)]
*  House, and I have a long ways to go and will continue to speak out and use my voice to help [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=357.84s)]
*  the American people and stand up and support the president. And Congresswoman, you know, one last [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=363.44s)]
*  question, because Hakeem Jeffries and the D triple C, they're all out there saying this is, you know, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=370.0s)]
*  a sign that the Trump agenda isn't working. And it's almost laughable because when you look at [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=374.88s)]
*  polling, you see President Trump at record highs and NBC. You see him at record highs and CNN and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  our Fox polling. And then you see Hakeem Jeffries there and the Democrats at record lows. So is this [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=385.12s)]
*  just political posturing he's doing because it seems to have no bearing in truth? It's desperate [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=391.76s)]
*  political posturing from the Democrats. As you pointed out, Kayleigh, they are polling at a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=397.12s)]
*  historic low point versus President Trump has historic approval ratings, as well as congressional [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  Republicans have historic approval ratings right now. And I want to point out that Hakeem Jeffries [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=406.72s)]
*  actually has among the lowest approval rating for any leader of either party in the House in [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=411.6s)]
*  modern history. And add on top of that, you have the implosion of Chuck Schumer, who is likely going [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  to face a very, very contested primary in New York state. And you have Governor Kathy Hochul, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  who is the lowest polling New York state governor ever. So this is a Democrat party that is an [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  absolute freefall. Democrats are Democrats are failing to unify versus Republicans are [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  defying all political odds. We are defying what the media is saying and continuing to pass these [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=439.52s)]
*  important agenda items, which we will do in the House working through the Senate, and the president [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=445.84s)]
*  will be there to sign them. But this is a shift in leadership from the abysmal failure of Joe Biden [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=450.4s)]
*  to the strength that we're seeing under President Trump. I've been proud to be a part of it. I am [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  here to deliver results on behalf of my constituents and the American people. And that's what I [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=459.76s)]
*  committed to doing today with the president. And I consider him a friend. I'm proud to be a leader [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=464.0s)]
*  in the House in terms of one of his top allies. And that will continue to be the case. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=469.28s)]
*  Well, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, you're being praised as a selfless [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=475.11999999999995s)]
*  warrior. And I look very much forward to seeing what the bright future holds for you. Thank you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orGjS_cb6NQ&t=478.71999999999997s)]
