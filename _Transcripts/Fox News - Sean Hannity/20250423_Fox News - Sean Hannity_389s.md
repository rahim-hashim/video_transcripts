# Psychologist breaks down 'assassin culture' in the left: 'WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY)
*  All right, a disturbing new trend is on the rise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=0.0s)]
*  A recent bombshell report found that assassination culture is spreading on the left and the deadly [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  consequences are being felt all across the country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Now the suspect in a seemingly random Arizona hatchet attack is now being charged with murder [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=14.16s)]
*  after 32 years of, after a 32 year old Jacob Couch died from the injury sustained in an [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=20.0s)]
*  attack earlier this month. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=25.62s)]
*  I mean, it's getting worse every day. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=27.04s)]
*  We're here with reaction psychologist and podcast host Dr. Jordan Peterson is here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=28.88s)]
*  Dr. Peterson, let me ask you about this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=33.68s)]
*  We hear now more and more loud calls for the murder of President Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=37.56s)]
*  We saw the two assassination or would be assassins. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=42.92s)]
*  Elon Musk is a target. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=45.8s)]
*  We see domestic terrorism at Tesla dealerships and the doxing of Tesla owners. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  We got this pro-Hamas culture, a designated terror organization on college campuses, and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  some on the left are in love with this charged assassin, Luigi Mangione. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  You're a lot smarter than me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=67.16s)]
*  Can you explain what the hell is going on here? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=68.24s)]
*  How is this becoming, you know, acceptable and so popular? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=70.8s)]
*  Well, I think the most important thing to do first is to draw a distinction between [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=76.64s)]
*  the political and the psychological and not to collapse them together. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=83.4s)]
*  So imagine this, imagine that there's a group of individuals, about 4% of the population, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=87.8s)]
*  who have a set of personality characteristics that have been described as dark tetrad. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=96.72s)]
*  So they're Machiavellian, they use their language to manipulate, they're narcissistic, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=102.06s)]
*  they want unearned social status and reputation, they're psychopathic, which makes them free [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=107.34s)]
*  of empathy and parasitical and predatory, and they're sadistic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  So they take positive delight in the unnecessary suffering of others. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=118.04s)]
*  Now those people also use false cries of victimization, let's say, to manipulate, and they're entitled. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=122.38s)]
*  They seek vengeance when it's unwarranted and they protest loudly and make very public [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=128.86s)]
*  cries for reparations that would be self-serving. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=134.94000000000003s)]
*  Okay, now the way those people operate is they look for what patterns of belief form [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=138.06s)]
*  groups that they can infiltrate and then capitalize on. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=145.18s)]
*  And that happens on the right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=149.66000000000003s)]
*  We did a report, the same group, on the use of Christ as king as a manipulative strategy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=151.4s)]
*  by bad actors, hypothetically, on the right, and this report identified the same sort of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=157.3s)]
*  people on the left. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=162.26s)]
*  But it's not primarily political. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=163.98s)]
*  They're wolves in sheep's clothing who look for where there's power and value and then [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=166.14s)]
*  adopt those beliefs as a surface camouflage so that they can elevate their moral status. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=171.7s)]
*  Now, and this has become worse in recent years, as far as I'm concerned, because the evolved [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=179.1s)]
*  strategies that we have for dealing with these psychopathic types, psychopathic narcissistic [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=186.08s)]
*  types, don't work well online. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=190.96s)]
*  And so the psychopaths can get away with their terrible manipulations online and they can [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=194.72s)]
*  find like-minded people and they can escape from any reputational consequences. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=199.28s)]
*  And so there's always been psychopaths. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=205.02s)]
*  Those are the Pharisees, for example, that Christ points to, the religious pretenders. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=207.52s)]
*  Those are the people who use God's name in vain and claim moral virtue and even religious [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=212.12s)]
*  devotion. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, all they're doing is feathering their own nests and furthering their own narrow [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  interests and the web, social media, anonymity, enables them to organize and also hides them [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=222.44s)]
*  much more effectively. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=230.24s)]
*  And this is a problem in religious organizations. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=231.8s)]
*  It's a problem in political organizations and it pathologizes the whole culture. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  80% of Americans agree on virtually everything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  And then there's these fringe people and they're not political. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  They're psychopathological narcissists who cloak themselves in political guise. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  And we all have to learn to distinguish between the political and the psychological. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  We're not good at it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=257.0s)]
*  Can you explain the evolution of the party of peace and give peace a chance and the party [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  that obsessed over January 6th but claimed falsely that the 574 riots in the summer of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=266.16s)]
*  2020 were mostly peaceful. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=273.16s)]
*  Now their voices are silent in light of recent acts of domestic terrorism against Tesla [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=275.88s)]
*  dealerships and calls for assassination. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  Explain the psychology behind that flagrant hypocrisy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=287.72s)]
*  Well, once a system of ideas has established itself and so it has some territory, you might [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=295.56s)]
*  say, you can capitalize on that by being a pretender and you can claim to be a pure upholder [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  of that particular doctrine and advance yourself, especially among naive people, while only [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=308.96s)]
*  playing even your own crowd for a fool. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=314.76s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=317.84s)]
*  And so hypocrisy doesn't bother anybody who's essentially narcissistic and psychopathic [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=319.36s)]
*  because they don't feel guilt. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=324.6s)]
*  They serve their own interests in a very narrow way and they'll use whatever arguments come [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=326.48s)]
*  to mind to advance their claims for power. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=331.32s)]
*  They're particularly good at using false cries of victimization. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=334.04s)]
*  And that's one of the places where the left is particularly susceptible, you might say, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=337.64s)]
*  to the psychopathic types because the leftist types tend to be more agreeable and hypothetically [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=342.2s)]
*  empathic. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  And so when psychopathic types come along and claim victim status or oppression of some [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  form, it's very difficult for the naive empaths of the left to distinguish between them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=354.32s)]
*  Dr. Peterson, a pleasure to have you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=359.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=363.44s)]

*  Somebody's going to get hurt. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=367.04s)]
*  You keep firing bullets and shooting at dealerships and putting Tesla's ablaze and the charging [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=368.04s)]
*  stations ablaze. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=374.44s)]
*  What do you think's going to happen? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8oCJCB39lY&t=375.44s)]
