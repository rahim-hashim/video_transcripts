# NO CHOICE?: Stephen A. Smith spars with Hannity over WH run consideration
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ)
*  Here with more ESPN hosts our good old friend Stephen A. Smith. What do you mean you have no choice you have a choice [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You don't have to get involved in politics. You can be a commentator. You can get into the political arena [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=6.68s)]
*  You can give your opinions. You can try to impact policy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=11.94s)]
*  You don't have to run for president to do that. So you have a choice. Why do you say you have no choice? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=14.92s)]
*  I didn't make an announcement [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=20.78s)]
*  Because I didn't make an announcement [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=22.6s)]
*  You said I have no choice [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=24.6s)]
*  Don't ask a question interrupt me before I even get a chance [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=27.12s)]
*  They answer your question directly they answer your question directly. Yeah, sure I got a choice [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=33.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day is here's what it comes down to Sean. You're absolutely right. I am a pundit [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=37.08s)]
*  I am a commentator. I am a journalist by trade and what have you [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=41.32s)]
*  These are the things that I care about and I care about having a voice and I care about making an impact and making a [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=44.18000000000001s)]
*  Difference especially when it comes to what's in the best interest of the United States of America [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=48.92s)]
*  There's no question about that the other side to it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=53.16s)]
*  However, is that I've had folks coming up to me [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=55.64s)]
*  Like I said elected officials and others including my own pastor a arbonar from the Christian Cultural Center here in Brooklyn, New York [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=58.0s)]
*  Who looked at me and said hey [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=64.0s)]
*  Show respect to people who believe in you and respect you and believe that you could do good for this country [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=66.0s)]
*  By at least leaving a door open. You never know what God has planned for you. That's years down the road [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=72.6s)]
*  The stop saying no no no and that's all I said that's all so I watched I watched this poll come out and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=78.56s)]
*  I did give you some of my thoughts on it. I have more to share with you. Yeah, I don't believe that whole [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=87.36s)]
*  That's my gut instinct. I think either do I probably I think I would say, you know [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=94.6s)]
*  The first poll that came out had you at 7% [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=99.08s)]
*  Maybe you're at five six seven percent [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=101.44s)]
*  Do I think that the party that is now led by AOC and Bernie Sanders and Jasmine Crockett [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  and the radical left would ever accept you or want your input or go along with your [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=111.48s)]
*  That's my point I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=121.08s)]
*  Believe I I don't believe I do I believe that people would have a conversation with me and get my perspective on things [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=123.0s)]
*  Sure, do I believe they would ever really really support me meaning those that have been entrenched within the Democratic Party [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=131.04s)]
*  Now and for the last several years absolutely positively not I saw the poll listen [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=136.68s)]
*  I'm not an expert in this but I've been following politics for for a very very long time [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=141.04s)]
*  We understand what comes with the process particularly if you're a Democratic nominee the superdelegates got to approve for you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=144.76s)]
*  You got I mean you got to get a whole bunch of supports from all over the place for you to even be the nominee [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=150.1s)]
*  You know people are going to stand in your way. Look at what happened [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=155.0s)]
*  You can look at Andrew Cuomo you can look at Al Franken [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=157.96s)]
*  You can look at a lot of different things and at least on the left what they say is that they eat their own [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=160.56s)]
*  Especially when they don't like you so they don't know me [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  You got people that's craving to go on. I'm sorry go ahead [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=170.68s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo who took out Andrew Cuomo you think it was the Republicans in New York [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=175.24s)]
*  I don't know who was the Democrats maybe maybe [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=180.44s)]
*  To them because they thought he had political aspirations [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, they thought that he was he listen he was he was in line to fight for the presidency fight for the Democratic nomination [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=188.96s)]
*  And at least at least on the left that's even those folks is speculated about it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=194.08s)]
*  But in the end here's what it comes down to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=198.32s)]
*  Poll comes out about two months ago or so I'm at around seven and a half percent of whatever ever since then I've been in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  The news ad nauseam every single damn day and suddenly I'm at one percent. I don't believe that for one second [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=206.08s)]
*  That's not how this works. No, but but what I'm saying to you is this at the end [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=211.32s)]
*  Absolutely, you know my listen listen, I'm not putting gas. I'm not putting gasoline on anything [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=215.16s)]
*  I'm just not running and what I mean by that is that I have a voice. I care about the issues [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=220.44s)]
*  I'm gonna attack them. I'm gonna address the issues that need to be addressed. No matter how I feel on the other side of the aisle [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=225.26s)]
*  I'm an independent. I'm gonna say what I feel. I'm gonna speak my mind and I'm not going to run from anybody [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=230.64s)]
*  So it doesn't mean that I'm running from office. I'm not gonna run from them [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=236.0s)]
*  You're not talking about being an independent [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=240.44s)]
*  About trying to change your party your party is a Democratic Party and you're trying to you know [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=242.76s)]
*  Have it both ways you want to either you're an independent or you're Democrat. What are you say? Well, that's that's what y'all say [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=248.22s)]
*  That's what people like you say politicians say this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=255.24s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of American citizens out there that don't want anything to do with the fringes that whether you're center-left or center-right [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=259.36s)]
*  They want common sense man. They want to listen to people that have common sense. Do you align? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=266.56s)]
*  Democratic Party or the Republican Party or are you more independent? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=272.88s)]
*  I'm more independent, but the reality is what's the chances of an independent winning a general election? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=278.6s)]
*  Slimly not it's a good see the Democrats. You know, there's better than me talk you you talked about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=285.2s)]
*  billionaires and prominent Democrats and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=290.6s)]
*  And you've been kind enough to share privately with me and I would never reveal my sources [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=293.76s)]
*  The number of people that have reached out to you these people are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  I think that's pretty enticing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=303.0s)]
*  I think some of them probably they're trying to get intel for other candidates that they're really supporting and not for you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=304.8s)]
*  They're not really there for you. I think some may sincerely be there [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=310.92s)]
*  But at the end of the day [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  Do you want to be part of a party that led to the greatest national security threat in our history with wide-open borders and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=316.24s)]
*  12 million unvetted illegals including known terrorists murderers rapists cartel members gang members [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=323.58s)]
*  Do you want to be part of a party that that's systemically lied about? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=329.9s)]
*  Biden's cognitive health that lied. Hang on that lied about the economy. Do you want to be part of a party? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=334.74s)]
*  We go here we go [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=341.02s)]
*  Do you want to be part of a party that cares more about the rights of men to play women's sports the rights of the illegals? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=342.1s)]
*  Over the safety of Americans I have Rachel Moran's mother on this program tonight [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=350.02s)]
*  Do you want to be part of a party that thinks it's a constitutional crisis? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  If in fact you eliminate waste fraud and abuse is that what you believe because I don't think you do [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=358.97999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, I do not okay [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=364.38s)]
*  And I spoke adamantly against some of those things that you articulated on my own show and on this show as along with various [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=366.94s)]
*  Other shows, but let me tell you what I do want to be a part of I want to be a part of a party [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=373.82s)]
*  And a part of an American society that looks at those actions that you just chronicled and says that has no business in the United [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=379.14s)]
*  States of America we can do better. Let's exercise common sense and decency [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=386.97999999999996s)]
*  Let's understand that even when we look at the right every damn thing ain't wrong about what Trump do [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=391.58s)]
*  You might have a problem with how he's going about with the tariffs, but his position about the terms isn't totally wrong [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=396.06s)]
*  Guess what the border is better since he's been in office because we no longer have open borders [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=402.3s)]
*  But we can still look at him and say you know what what Obrego the bottom line is this the you know immigration [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=407.76s)]
*  You know a judge ruled to for protection for the kid and the Supreme Court voted nine and up to zero [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=413.68s)]
*  In order for him to be here go back and get it from El Salvador [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  We can agree on some things we could disagree on some things but in the end [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=423.09999999999997s)]
*  It's about a core decency that we are devoid of right now in our politics [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  I hope somebody from the Democratic Party steps up [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=431.96s)]
*  I hope I light a fire under them and get a more qualified individual in this mix so people can stop asking me this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=434.52s)]
*  Stuff and I can enjoy my life, but if it continues to get worse [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=440.0s)]
*  I got it all right. Let me ask you this do you believe in the the the the environmental policies? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=449.96s)]
*  Climate alarmism Green New Deal policies do you agree with the DEI? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=456.91999999999996s)]

*  Transgenderism do you think one tax dollars? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=467.36s)]
*  One tax dollar ever go into any of those programs especially abroad [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=471.88s)]
*  Why are we given a penny to have in University when they have a 50 billion dollar endowment help me with that I? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=476.76s)]
*  Don't know the answer to that question, but what if I what if I find out that there's a pretty decent answer for that question [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=483.76s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that question when you bring up Harvard you would think with an endowment like that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=490.72s)]
*  They wouldn't do it, but why has this federal government spent years giving it? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=494.7s)]
*  Maybe it's because they make a contribution to the American fabric that we you're not articulating on this [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=497.88s)]
*  We don't know the answer that question [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=504.12s)]
*  About the left I could ask questions about the right to let's just be fair [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  Why are you paying for an Ivy League elitist institution? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=514.52s)]
*  When maybe we could be shoring up community colleges trade schools [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=518.8s)]
*  So we can be helping the children of the hard-working men and women [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=523.1999999999999s)]
*  That don't have an opportunity ever think about an elite private school like that. I'll give you the last word [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=527.12s)]
*  Okay, that's a that's a fair question and and and let's hope Trump the president of the United States [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=533.04s)]
*  Has a has a as a big-time answer for that I get that part [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=538.68s)]
*  I understand what you're saying as a common American citizen you look at your frustration [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=542.24s)]
*  He's cutting them off but why but but why the intent matters how you [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=546.28s)]
*  We can't be paying these these Ivy School brats tuition if they want to go to an Ivy League school [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVFtreMt2FQ&t=556.0400000000001s)]
