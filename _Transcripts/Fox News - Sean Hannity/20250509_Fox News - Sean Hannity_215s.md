# Here's what Democrats couldn't 'grasp' about Kamala Harris' defeat
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s)
*  To respond, Oklahoma Senator Mark Wayne Mullin, your reaction to that? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, of course they got to throw out the sexist and racist card, right? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=3.92s)]
*  They can't talk about the fact that she couldn't even figure out what accent to use when she was [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=7.68s)]
*  talking to which crowd. She never could actually explain her policies. She was always shifting to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=12.0s)]
*  the right or to the left, depending on who she was visiting with. And the truth is, the only person [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=18.32s)]
*  who had worse polling numbers than Joe Biden was Kamala Harris. So they picked a bad candidate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=23.28s)]
*  And so what did they think was going to happen? Failure was going to take place, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=30.48s)]
*  and they want to blame the fact that they don't believe in actually true and fair elections in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=34.64s)]
*  the Democrat Party anymore. They want to king and crown their next president or the next person [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=39.52s)]
*  to lead their party. Of course they're going to fail. What they couldn't understand is that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=46.16s)]
*  President Trump was able to resonate with the American people. He was able to speak directly [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=50.16s)]
*  to them. And after having four years of Biden in the office, they wanted someone with actually [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  high energy, which we know, Sean, we know President Trump. No one has higher energy than President [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  Trump. You know, Kamala was part of the cover-up of Joe's cognitive decline. She was part of the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=66.72s)]
*  big lie that the border's secure and the border's closed, part of the big lie in the disaster on the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=74.08s)]
*  economy. She was the one that wanted taxpayer-funded sex change operations. Her running mate wanted [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=79.6s)]
*  taxpayer-funded college education for illegals. She was the one that was so out of touch and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=86.0s)]
*  couldn't even do an interview or put a sentence together herself. So, you know, I find this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  narrative both deeply offensive and just not true. Well, who knows her best? Probably her state, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  and she couldn't even win her own state in the primary when she ran against Joe Biden. She had [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  to drop out because she couldn't win California. She didn't pull good even across the country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=109.2s)]
*  That's why President Trump won all the states. He won by overwhelming popular vote, and he won [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=115.2s)]
*  the electoral college. Plus, he delivered the House, then kept them and controlled the Republicans, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=121.68s)]
*  and delivered the Senate for the American people in the hands of the Republican people. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=127.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris decided to go to the left of even where the party was at. They thought that was [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=132.56s)]
*  their winning piece. They thought that they'd go farther to the DEI, farther to this woke movement, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=138.32s)]
*  that the American people was at that moment ready to make the change. What they found out, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=143.2s)]
*  it's not happening. What's interesting, they lost the election, and they still haven't learned their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=149.28s)]
*  lesson. Look what they're doing right now. They're constantly digging farther to the left. They're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  digging up the old language that you just pointed out a while ago, still calling Republicans that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=157.12s)]
*  support President Trump trash, calling us racists, calling us sexists. You just name the word, throw [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=162.56s)]
*  it out there, because they can't talk about policy. What could they possibly talk about with Joe Biden's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=169.44s)]
*  policy? His failure to secure the border, his failure to bring down inflation. I mean, where do you start? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=174.16s)]
*  Well, we need an investigation into who knew what and when. What did you know? When did you know it [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=183.6s)]
*  in terms of Joe's cognitive decline, because that was a national security threat? Senator, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=189.84s)]
*  we have a White House that's going to do that too, underneath President Trump. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a national security threat. That president doesn't know what time of day or what day of the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seDaPGGec-s&t=198.64000000000001s)]
