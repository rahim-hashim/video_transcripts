# 'ABSOLUTELY NUTS': Lara Trump says Dems have nothing to offer Americans
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA)
*  President Trump has totally broken the Democratic Party in 100 days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=0.0s)]
*  And as of now, there is no one capable of picking up the pieces. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=4.48s)]
*  Here now with reaction, the host of My View, right here on the Fox News channel, Laura [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=7.72s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=11.52s)]
*  Is with us, Laura. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=12.52s)]
*  It's 100 days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=13.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=14.52s)]
*  I think my analysis is right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=15.52s)]
*  I think the party is broken. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I think your father-in-law broke them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=18.88s)]
*  And if their strategies is sit-ins and singing and, oh, F-bombs and bingo paddles. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=21.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=29.160000000000004s)]
*  I'm kind of okay with that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=30.160000000000004s)]
*  If AOC, the squad, Bernie and Jasmine are the leaders, I'm fine with that too. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, I think that 2024 marked the end of the Democrat Party as we've always known [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump broke them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  They are destroyed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=45.68000000000001s)]
*  They are shattered. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  As to how a party would implode on itself and be literally a circular firing squad. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=48.68s)]
*  They're doing it right now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=55.84s)]
*  Just take some notes and you've got the movie written, the book written right here in front [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=56.84s)]
*  of you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=60.4s)]
*  The problem with the Democrats right now is they actually have nothing to offer America. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=61.4s)]
*  They have no solutions. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=65.88s)]
*  They have no forward progress. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=67.3s)]
*  They have nothing enticing for the American people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  What do they have? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=71.68s)]
*  Sitting for 12 hours on the steps of the Capitol. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=72.68s)]
*  By the way, Cory Booker, who had that 24-hour ranting and raving on the Senate floor, I [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=75.8s)]
*  think a lot of people remember, with, by the way, not a single quote to be taken from that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  whole fiasco. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  Pretty embarrassing, if you ask me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  And you contrast that with Donald Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=87.92s)]
*  What is it that Donald Trump has done in 100 days? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  More than Joe Biden did for the country in four years, and that is per USA Today, Sean. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  That is not a favorable outlet to Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=99.84s)]
*  They even have to admit it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=102.7s)]
*  This is a man who hit the ground running, who every day delivers for the American people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=104.0s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept was a slogan for the campaign in 2020 because in the first [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=108.56s)]
*  term Donald Trump delivered so much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=113.68s)]
*  He wanted absolutely no time off. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=115.6s)]
*  This time he hit the ground running and we see the results. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=117.9s)]
*  We see a secure southern border unlike anything America has ever seen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=120.68s)]
*  We see our standing on the world stage reestablished. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=124.52s)]
*  We see that there is finally someone who is addressing our bloated government so that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=127.4s)]
*  we don't have to see the end of this country because of it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=131.88s)]
*  These are things the American people wanted. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  He's delivering on the promises he made this campaign and the things that people voted [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=137.56s)]
*  in him into office for. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=141.2s)]
*  And the funny part is it's driving the Democrats absolutely nuts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=143.28s)]
*  They can't handle it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  It is next level Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  It is spread like a disease throughout the Democrat Party and it's really something to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=150.58s)]
*  watch. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=154.28s)]
*  It's like a cancer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=155.28s)]
*  On the one hand, so the leaders that have emerged are the names I mentioned. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=157.28s)]
*  Members of the squad, AOC. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=162.12s)]
*  She's kind of the mantle of radical statism, communism from Bernie's being handed to her. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett and then Hakeem Jeffries and Schumer, they seem scared to death to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  ever take them on, which is an interesting dynamic in and of itself. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  Then within the DNC you have the vice chair fighting the chairman over whether or not [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  they're going to primary elected Democrats because they're not radical enough. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=184.32s)]
*  Yeah, and this is what they think the American people want to see. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  It's absolutely wrong. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  And what are they offering? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=197.0s)]
*  You have J.B. Pritzker out there, by the way, suggesting, I don't know, sounded pretty violent [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=198.0s)]
*  to me. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  You have people saying, oh, we're going to go back to the old resist playbook. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  Let's impeach Donald Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  Let me ask the Democrats really quickly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=209.48s)]
*  How did that work out for you guys? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  How did you feel on November 5th when Donald Trump won the popular vote first time in 20 [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=213.32s)]
*  years? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=217.72s)]
*  A Republican has ever done that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=218.72s)]
*  Every single swing state, the electoral vote. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=219.72s)]
*  How did you guys feel? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=221.94s)]
*  If you want to see your party absolutely destroyed, then go on this way. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  And I honestly, Sean, sometimes I look at it as a former RNC co-chair and I say, you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=227.16s)]
*  know what? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Let them keep down this path because they're never going to win another election. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  But look, in reality, our country was based on debate, on different ideas and being able [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=235.48s)]
*  to come together and talk about those ideas, it would be great if we didn't have a bunch [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=241.32s)]
*  of lunatics on the left who were running the Democrat party. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=245.28s)]
*  It would actually be better overall for America for a little sanity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=248.8s)]
*  But I'll tell you what, if this is the way they want to keep going, guess what? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=252.28s)]
*  We have a great bench on the Republican side. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=255.24s)]
*  And I know there are a lot of people who'd be happy to take a lot of their positions. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=258.12s)]
*  And no doubt. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=261.88s)]
*  All right, Laura Trump, appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-as51FYuyA&t=262.88s)]
