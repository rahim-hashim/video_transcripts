# Hannity: A moment of truth is coming
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs)
*  Sean Hannity is live in Saudi Arabia. He did interview President Trump on Air Force One [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday. It will air tonight. Hey, Sean. Hey, guys. How are you? Welcome to beautiful [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=4.8s)]
*  Riyadh. It's very hot here, I will tell you that. A hundred degrees, right? It's been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=12.08s)]
*  a, it's been so, I just got, a hundred plus and no breeze. But putting all that aside, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=16.0s)]
*  I just got out of a lunch, President Trump, his cabinet, the cabinet members that are [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=23.28s)]
*  with him, MBS, all of the top officials in Saudi Arabia, all of the top business people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=27.8s)]
*  in America from every major corporation, every private equity company. And it was designed [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=37.72s)]
*  that it was sort of like a perfect mix at every table. And it, this is, it's very interesting [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=45.32s)]
*  what's happening here. And for a lot of different reasons, it is clear that now Saudi Arabia [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=52.84s)]
*  is wanting to have the best relationship they can possibly have with the United States. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  But more importantly, they see the opportunity only because of President Trump. We cover [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  a wide range of issues in tonight's interview. Obviously the prescription drug issue, obviously [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=72.28s)]
*  with Pakistan and India, obviously what happens with China and tariffs and so on and so forth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=78.32s)]
*  I saw Scott Besson while I was here. Certainly what's going to happen this week, later on [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=84.63999999999999s)]
*  this week with Putin and Vladimir and Zelensky. So there's a lot happening, all of which we [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  got into with the president and we'll be covering tonight. Very interesting ride in. I don't [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=96.56s)]
*  know if you guys saw any of the pictures, but F-15s literally guiding us, you know, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=103.0s)]
*  right down to the ground when we landed in Riyadh. And very interesting time, I will [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=108.64s)]
*  tell you that. I did have an interaction with the president and the crown prince. That was [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=114.56s)]
*  pretty interesting. And I walked up to the dais. Somebody brought me up to the dais. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=119.52s)]
*  I didn't walk up on my own. I said hi to the president. The president introduced me [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=126.44s)]
*  to the crown prince and the president in a lot of good humor said, now he doesn't quite [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=133.16s)]
*  make the money that you do, but, and he went on to tell a funny story and, you know, in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  very Trumpian fashion. And it was pretty special and pretty funny. And what really surprised [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=146.12s)]
*  me is everybody from Saudi Arabia on that dais all said to me, Oh, we know Mr. Hannity. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=152.64s)]
*  We watch your show all the time. And I'm like, I look a lot better with makeup, don't you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  think? And everyone laughed. And I know you all agree with that. So it was a perfect... [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=163.16s)]
*  You're not doing so bad, Sean, to be your age. It's all the jujitsu that's helping out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=170.16s)]
*  But real quick, Sean, you know I got to tease you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=178.16s)]
*  Well, I created... LJ, my friend, my protege, I'm your biggest supporter and I come on your [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=183.16s)]
*  show and look what happens. It's unbelievable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  This is true. Sean, tell me what sense did you give from the crown prince for helping [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=193.8s)]
*  us with peace as it relates to Israel and Eradicating Hamas, but they seem a little [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=200.8s)]
*  uneasy to accepting some of the Palestinian people. Did you see a willingness to help [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=207.8s)]
*  the president, broker, peace between Israel? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=215.08s)]
*  Yeah. You're, Lauren, LJ, as usual, you're asking a great question. There, I sat next [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  to one of the cabinet members. Maybe I shouldn't mention it because it was kind of a private [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=226.56s)]
*  get-together lunch. And he's one of the longest-serving cabinet members in Saudi Arabia. And we went [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=232.04s)]
*  chapter and verse about what the kingdom is looking for. Their overwhelming desire is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=241.2s)]
*  for peace in the region. And their overwhelming belief is that the person that is best able [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=248.2s)]
*  to bring that together is going to be President Trump. And there's a reason why that the Saudis [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=255.2s)]
*  have committed over a trillion dollars in investment in the United States. For example, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=262.56s)]
*  we'll be... Next we'll go to Qatar. Then we'll go to the UAE. UAE has committed over a trillion [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=267.56s)]
*  five in the United States to have all their top ministers, all their top business people, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=275.08s)]
*  every American, I mean, from Coca-Cola on down and Steve Schwartzman. I could run through [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=282.08s)]
*  the list of people that were in this room. It was a who's who, Elon Musk. I can go straight [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=287.08s)]
*  on down the list. And to see the desire to have a great business working relationship [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=292.08s)]
*  that benefits both countries. And that seems to be where their focus is. When we spoke [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  about radicalism and extremism, when we did have that discussion and when we did speak [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  about Iran, it was very, very clear that they understand that Iran has been fomenting terror. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=311.2s)]
*  They're the number one state sponsor of terror. On the one hand, I guess Saudi Arabia has [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=318.2s)]
*  to thread a needle because they don't want to... They don't want to... They don't want [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=323.4s)]
*  to start a conflict themselves with Iran. So they're in a bit of a... They're in a delicate [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=326.2s)]
*  situation because of their proximity to Iran. And there's no doubt that behind the scenes, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=334.56s)]
*  one of the more untold stories of Donald Trump's first term is, in my view, he was able to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=341.36s)]
*  put together a coalition that included the U.S., Israel, the Saudis, the Emirates, the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=346.4s)]
*  Jordanians, the Egyptians. They were all aligned. They were all sharing intelligence. They were [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  all building business relationships to prevent Iranian hegemony. Everybody understands clearly [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  also, which is an issue front and center now, if you look at the IAEA and their projections [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=365.72s)]
*  as to Iran's nuclear enrichment program, they believe they're at about 66%. To get to weapons [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  grade, 90% enrichment, you can get that done from what I understand from four to six weeks. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=378.8s)]
*  So the time period that the Iranians will have for breaking out into nuclear weapon [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=386.16s)]
*  capability is very short. And the message team seems to be clear, and the president [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=394.12s)]
*  has reiterated that, that they will not be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. From everybody [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  that I spoke to at this luncheon today, they are in full agreement with that policy, probably [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  wouldn't state it publicly, and they understand that it's going to be, this is go time. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=410.72s)]
*  The Iranians have a choice. The president said, I'd rather they choose the peaceful [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  route. I believe that he means that. I believe he's sincere about that. I think the president [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  has shown that he wants peace in the Middle East. He wants peace in Europe. And so I think [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=428.44s)]
*  the choice is ultimately going to be the Iranians. And they've been offered, Marco Rubio said [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  on my show, if they want nuclear power enrichment, those rods will be provided to them. But they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=438.32s)]
*  cannot enrich on their own. There's no need for them to enrich on their own. So that would [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=444.68s)]
*  mean American inspectors, that would mean they stop their enrichment program. That would [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=449.44s)]
*  mean any place, anywhere, any time inspections. And so there's a moment of truth that's definitely [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=454.6s)]
*  coming for the region and for the world. And the distinct impression I got from everybody [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=460.78s)]
*  I spoke to, and I spoke to a lot of people today, was very clearly that that can't happen [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  and that they don't want it to happen. And they understand that they're in jeopardy. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=471.28s)]
*  Yeah, but just not saying nuclear weapon is not enough. They have to have zero enrichment. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=475.26s)]
*  They have to be incapable of doing it. Saudi Arabia will get a nuclear weapon right away. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=478.94s)]
*  We'll have another Pakistan-India situation where every other, every six months nuclear [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=483.29999999999995s)]
*  war could be happening. So that's why I'm just very curious that the foreign minister [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=488.78s)]
*  of Iran showed up before President Trump got there. And what is he saying? You know, what [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=492.46s)]
*  is he saying in Saudi Arabia? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=498.02s)]
*  Well, what they say, they believe what we believe, Brian. I mean, they understand that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=500.26s)]
*  a nuclear-armed Iran, it just, it brings nothing but fear, distrust and instability to the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=507.14s)]
*  region. They also understand that it's bad business. You know, one of the things that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=515.1s)]
*  was very obvious to me as I listened in on conversations, had conversations, I met some [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=523.14s)]
*  of the top business people in our country and the top business people here in Saudi [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=528.86s)]
*  Arabia is most people are about business and having better lives and creating wealth and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=532.9s)]
*  happiness and prosperity, opportunity for their children and grandchildren versus the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=538.86s)]
*  alternative which is, you know, never ending war, never ending death and destruction. And, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=544.22s)]
*  you know, the number one state sponsor of terror has been Iran. They see what's happening. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=551.54s)]
*  Interesting things that you can put together. I heard your previous guest talking about, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=556.94s)]
*  you know, the history, the distrust that frankly was earned by the Saudis over time. However, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=561.34s)]
*  when Israel got hit the first time a year ago, April, when Iran fired directly at Israel, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=568.5s)]
*  remember, the Saudis, Jordanians, a lot of countries joined in in missile defense helping [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=576.46s)]
*  to provide Israel with the defense they needed from that attack. That was an interesting [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=582.34s)]
*  moment. I think that might be something we look back on as a critical moment where these [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=586.74s)]
*  countries not only were threading the needle, they were threading it the right way. So there's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=592.1s)]
*  a lot of hope here. And I think a lot of it, I think there's a lot of the hope is based [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=596.66s)]
*  on President Trump and the strength that he brings. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=603.06s)]
*  One of the things that also came up, I had a really interesting discussion with one of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=606.62s)]
*  the foreign ministers here about the last administration and how they did not engage. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=612.3s)]
*  They did not involve themselves. They were very acutely aware that the sanctions that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=619.14s)]
*  Donald Trump had put in place against the Iranians in his first term were extraordinarily effective. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=624.9599999999999s)]
*  And when Joe Biden turned a blind eye towards those sanctions, unfortunately, that resulted [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=631.76s)]
*  in the Iranians getting very, very wealthy. What did they do with that wealth? Did they [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=637.36s)]
*  help their citizenry? Did they help make, you know, lift people out of poverty? No, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=641.4799999999999s)]
*  they were fomenting terror and they were providing weaponry to Hamas and Hezbollah and other [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=646.92s)]
*  Islamic jihad and the Houthis and building out their own nuclear program and ballistic [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=655.24s)]
*  missile program. So it is in that sense that they see where the Iranians' mentality is. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=660.76s)]
*  And there's no love lost between these two countries, I can tell you that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=668.52s)]
*  Sean, we only have 90 seconds, but what are you hearing about? I know that Saudi Arabia [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=672.04s)]
*  wants the U.S. to defend them if they're attacked by Iran or those allies. They want access [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INxZbvVexqs&t=676.5999999999999s)]
