# Dr. Oz: Even the Dems realize this system is so sick
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk)
*  All right, now on to a wild new smear campaign from the Democratic Party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=0.0s)]
*  They are now actually claiming that if passed, this big, beautiful budget bill of Donald [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Trump will kill scores of Americans. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=9.56s)]
*  It's going to kill you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=12.4s)]
*  Remember, Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  They want dirty air and water, and they want to kick grandma and grandpa over a cliff and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=18.98s)]
*  kill them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=23.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=24.38s)]
*  We're all going to die, Bill. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=25.86s)]
*  And that shows the callousness, the callousness of this Republican majority in the House and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=28.099999999999998s)]
*  the Republican majority in the Senate. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=35.98s)]
*  And the reality is, because of this House Republican bill, if it were to pass and become [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  law, people will die. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  Now other top Democrats claiming that the bill would kill 51,000 people a year because [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=46.82s)]
*  of non-existent cuts to Medicaid, non-existent, here to respond, the Centers for Medicare, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=53.04s)]
*  Medicaid services, the administrator, Dr. Mehmet Oz is with us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Dr. Oz, are there any such cuts in this bill? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=63.44s)]
*  My reading of it is the only thing that would be cut are those people that don't belong [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=67.84s)]
*  on the rolls, that have given fraudulent information that will be weeded out of services they never [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=75.6s)]
*  deserved in the first place. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=82.2s)]
*  There's no cuts that I know of that exist in that bill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=84.2s)]
*  In every scenario that I've seen, including the one that's in the current, one big, beautiful [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=87.62s)]
*  bill, we are increasing Medicaid spending. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=92.34s)]
*  I'll give you a number. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=95.3s)]
*  We project $200 billion of more money being spent on Medicaid. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=96.3s)]
*  We already have a health care system that spends twice as much on individuals as any [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=101.3s)]
*  other system in the world. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=106.26s)]
*  So the problem isn't money. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=107.7s)]
*  The issue is the increased expenditures on Medicaid, which is 50 percent bigger than [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=109.77999999999999s)]
*  it was five years ago before the pandemic, is crippling the system. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=114.02s)]
*  We are hurting Medicaid. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=118.33999999999999s)]
*  The president said, and it's very clear on this, he wants to love and cherish these programs. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  Our job is to save this system. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=124.74s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=126.78s)]
*  Because as you walk into our building at Healthy Human Services where me and Bobby Kennedy [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=127.78s)]
*  and others reside, there's a great quote. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=130.78s)]
*  It says it's the moral obligation of government to take care of people at the dawn of their [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=133.01999999999998s)]
*  life, the children, those at the twilight of their life, elderly, and those living in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=136.66s)]
*  the shadows, folks who have handicaps, who are disabled. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=141.78s)]
*  That's the job, to make sure that original population that 60 years ago was envisioned [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=145.1s)]
*  to require Medicaid, great people protect their vulnerable. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=149.7s)]
*  We're going to do that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  But if you're cowardly and not willing to make important changes to fix the system so [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=153.9s)]
*  it's viable for the next generation, then you're actually hamstringing it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=158.74s)]
*  So specifically, what does this bill do? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  Sean, it says you have to be able to either get a job or try to get a job. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  Volunteer. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=168.3s)]
*  Get an education. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=169.3s)]
*  Just help out around the home by taking care of a relative. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=170.3s)]
*  Do something that shows you have agency over your future. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  If you're not willing to do that, we're not going to give you Medicaid. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=176.58s)]
*  I think most Americans wouldn't do that if they're offered the choice of free health [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=180.06s)]
*  insurance in return. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=183.66s)]
*  I have confidence in the American people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=184.86s)]
*  The Democratic Party does not. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't think Americans are going to do that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=189.46s)]
*  And I've got more news for you on this topic. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=191.46s)]
*  Even the Democrats realize the system is so sick, they had to unwind COVID. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=193.22s)]
*  That resulted over the last year, year and a half, in 15 million Americans coming off [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=198.18s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  But it did not change dramatically the number of people uninsured. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  90 percent of these people went on to the exchanges. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=207.3s)]
*  They went on to commercial health insurance. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  They went to Medicare. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  They got other forms of coverage. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=212.82s)]
*  So the system is resilient. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=214.66s)]
*  We're doing what needs to be done to heal a bad infection to preserve the system. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=216.22s)]
*  That's the president's charge to me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=220.66s)]
*  Dr. Oz, the trajectory of growth the last five years has been very high. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=222.1s)]
*  And I mean growth increases, massive increases in spending. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=229.26s)]
*  Now when Newt Gingrich partnered with Bill Clinton, they reduced the rate of growth to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=233.7s)]
*  a whopping 7 percent a year, every year for seven years. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=239.1s)]
*  That resulted in a balanced budget. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=243.14s)]
*  They had five balanced budgets in a row. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=244.9s)]
*  We've not balanced the budget since. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=246.7s)]
*  And they reduced the rate of growth instead of baseline budgeting. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=250.02s)]
*  And they only reduced it to 7 percent a year. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=254.98s)]
*  That's a big increase. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=257.26s)]
*  It was said at the time that old people were going to die and that they were cutting, cutting, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=259.74s)]
*  cutting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=265.74s)]
*  They weren't cutting. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=266.74s)]
*  They just reduced the increase from 12 percent to 7 percent so we could stop stealing from [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=267.74s)]
*  our kids. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=272.56s)]
*  Is that similar here? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=273.56s)]
*  Similar scenario. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=275.9s)]
*  We're asking for radical things like make sure you double check in Social Security that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=276.9s)]
*  the patient didn't already die. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  So why would you pay health insurance for someone who's not alive anymore? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  They're asking for income verification. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  You can't just tell us what you made. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=288.41999999999996s)]
*  We actually should be able to check that and states should feel that obligation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=289.9s)]
*  We also have crises that have now led to 660,000 people having Medicaid in multiple states. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=293.34s)]
*  That means the federal government's paying for people in multiple states for full health [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=300.4s)]
*  coverage even though that's not really what's being done. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=304.82s)]
*  Only one state is actually taking care of the patient. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  But I'll give you the biggest and most shameful issue for me, Sean. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=309.9s)]
*  This wasn't true until the end of the Biden administration. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  Even the Obama administration prevented this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  They banned individuals on Medicaid who are getting free health care insurance from getting [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=318.52s)]
*  health care benefits that were greater than those on Medicare who've been paying into [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=323.94s)]
*  the system. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  If you're on Medicare at home right now, guess what? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  Would people on Medicaid in your state probably reimburse their doctors more than you do? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=331.02s)]
*  I'll say that again. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=336.3s)]
*  People on Medicaid are paying their doctors less, sometimes one third what Medicaid patients [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=337.58s)]
*  in that same state are paying doctors. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=342.86s)]
*  This isn't correct. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=344.86s)]
*  It's not right. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=346.26s)]
*  It's a moral failing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=347.26s)]
*  This bill protects now seniors to make sure they get to pay their doctors the same as [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=348.9s)]
*  Medicaid patients. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=352.78s)]
*  Not a difference. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=354.18s)]
*  We need to rethink. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=355.18s)]
*  These are rational choices. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=356.18s)]
*  We need to rethink a lot of this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=358.3s)]
*  Health care savings accounts. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=359.9s)]
*  We need telemedicine included, health care cooperatives. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=361.17999999999995s)]
*  Catastrophic care is part of an equation of lower cost. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=364.5s)]
*  But Sean, one favor. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  To interrupt you, it's my birthday as you know. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=370.41999999999996s)]
*  Happy birthday. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=372.78s)]
*  Today I got my Medicaid card. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=373.78s)]
*  So I'm asking all Americans, please, if you're turning 65 like I am and many of you are on [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=376.41999999999996s)]
*  Medicaid, go to Medicare.gov. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=382.5s)]
*  I've got my Medicare card. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=385.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm proudly a beneficiary of the program that I've been asked to run. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  So Medicare.gov, check it out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3omyGHpMsk&t=390.86s)]
