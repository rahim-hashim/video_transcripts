# MAJOR SHAKEUP: Could this be Gov. Gavin Newsom's successor?
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, a state lawmaker in California has a plan to help fight homelessness. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=2.12s)]
*  He wants to allow community college students to sleep in their cars on campus. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=6.92s)]
*  Helping homeless students by allowing them to be homeless is just one of the latest and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=11.32s)]
*  greatest ideas coming out of the Golden State and its fearless leader, Gavin Newsom, who [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=14.84s)]
*  is pretty clearly focused on an upcoming presidential campaign. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=20.0s)]
*  He spent a lot of time recently lecturing the Democratic Party on how to rise from the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=24.68s)]
*  ashes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  And his latest bit of advice is, quote, We just have to move beyond the guy or gal on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=29.84s)]
*  the white horse that's going to come in and save the day. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=34.56s)]
*  Whatever that means. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=38.56s)]
*  One thing is for sure, Newsom's time as governor of California is coming to an end very soon [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=39.92s)]
*  because he's term limited and the race to replace him is already underway. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=44.48s)]
*  While Kamala Harris waits to make a decision, others are stepping forward. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=48.92s)]
*  This includes one Republican you may know who has just launched his campaign with the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=53.88s)]
*  promise to make California golden again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=58.36s)]
*  It's none other than former Fox host Steve Hilton, and he joins us right now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  Steve, looks like you're out on the campaign trail already working really hard. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=65.92s)]
*  So tell us about your campaign and how it's been for the last couple of days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=70.48s)]
*  I know you're just getting started. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=73.56s)]
*  Yeah, great to see you, Katie. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=75.36s)]
*  We're literally on the road here in California. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=77.6s)]
*  By the way, this this new housing thing, it reminds me of the last genius idea they had [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  here in California, which is to deal with the crime problem by legalizing it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=85.2s)]
*  They've caused all these problems. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=89.84s)]
*  The housing costs in California, the highest in the country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  That's why so many people are leaving. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Everything is the most expensive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=97.48s)]
*  Families just can't make it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=99.0s)]
*  The rent, the gas, electricity, water, everything, the most expensive. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=100.84s)]
*  And then still you have the homelessness crisis and still you have the crime. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=105.76s)]
*  The schools are a disaster. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=109.0s)]
*  Everything's a disaster. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=110.84s)]
*  And my argument in this campaign is imagine another 15 years of the Democrat one party [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=111.84s)]
*  rule that landed us in this mess. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=118.52s)]
*  We can't allow that to happen. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=121.36s)]
*  And actually, it's not just for the people of California. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=122.52s)]
*  This matters, the 2026 election here matters to everyone in America because so many of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=124.88s)]
*  the terrible ideas that have infected all of America, they start here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=129.76s)]
*  The Green New Deal, the insanity on gender and race ballot harvesting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=134.44s)]
*  We've got to stop it here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=139.0s)]
*  And I think we've got a really good shot in 2026. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, I really admire your dedication because California is the number one state where people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  are renting you halls and chasing them, taking them out of the state to other places throughout [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=147.68s)]
*  the country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=152.24s)]
*  But on this California legislation where they're saying, well, kids should just sleep in their [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=153.24s)]
*  cars. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Hasn't the state of California under Governor Newsom's watch spent billions of dollars to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  solve this crisis? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=165.24s)]
*  And now the solution is to have kids sleeping in their cars? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=166.72s)]
*  I mean, where is all this money going? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=170.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=172.28s)]
*  The number keeps going up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=173.28s)]
*  A few months ago, there was an audit. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=175.08s)]
*  It was $24 billion. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=176.96s)]
*  They couldn't figure out what it did for homelessness. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Now it's pulled up to $38 billion. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=181.84s)]
*  I was in San Francisco just the other day looking at the problem firsthand. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=184.32s)]
*  Here's the issue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  They passed a law in 2016. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=189.84s)]
*  It's called Housing First. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  It makes it illegal to actually deal with the problem, which is more than 80 percent [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  of people who are homeless have either mental health problems or drug or alcohol addiction. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=199.04s)]
*  In California, it is illegal for any organization working with the homeless to require treatment, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  sobriety, anything. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  So the problem just keeps getting worse and worse. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=213.28s)]
*  We have 11 percent of America's population, nearly 50 percent of our homeless population. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  It's another example of the complete disaster that this one-party rule has caused. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=221.68s)]
*  We've got to change direction. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=225.96s)]
*  Well, the homelessness industrial complex is also run by a single party in that state. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=227.44s)]
*  But when you're on the campaign show, and you've only been out for a couple of days, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=232.72s)]
*  but I know you're talking to all kinds of people, probably at cafes, on the road. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=236.0s)]
*  What are Californians saying to you about the situation there? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  So it's very interesting, actually, Katie. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=246.08s)]
*  I'm getting a lot of people just saying thank you for stepping up. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  It's beyond just partisan policies. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  You've got Republicans, Democrats, independents. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=252.96s)]
*  Everyone can see we need change. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  But for years, there's been no sense of hope that it's even possible. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  But things have got so bad now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  And actually, you saw real progress in the 2024 election. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=262.76s)]
*  President Trump got more votes in California last year than any Republican candidate for a generation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  Things are turning. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  Ten counties flipped from blue to red. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=274.48s)]
*  You've got the opportunity to take the Trump revolution with working class voters, Latino voters, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=277.16s)]
*  and really turn that into a big win in 2026. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=283.2s)]
*  I call it the California revolution. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=286.4s)]
*  That's how we're going to make California golden again. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=288.12s)]
*  Well, I love the big pickup truck behind you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=290.48s)]
*  You're off to a great start. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=292.76s)]
*  And when you win, maybe we'll want to export California policies to the rest of the country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=293.8s)]
*  So best of luck, Steve. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=298.68s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=301.68s)]
*  And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=307.12s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKJCaS5yWQ&t=310.56s)]
