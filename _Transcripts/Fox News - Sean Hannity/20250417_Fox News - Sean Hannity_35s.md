*  The Democrat Party has been thoroughly, completely radicalized. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=0.0s)]
*  They're an open borders party. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=3.84s)]
*  They're a communist party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=5.44s)]
*  They're a party that excuses violence and left-wing terrorism. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  They're a party that's pulling at 21 percent. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=9.92s)]
*  But if they keep fighting to spring illegal alien gang members loose from foreign countries [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=12.24s)]

*  keep them safe. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump is fighting harder to keep our families safe than anyone who has ever [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=27.36s)]
*  sat behind that resolute desk. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPnf_tzb_-g&t=31.12s)]
