# ‘UNHINGED’: Democrats are in a ‘state of rage’ after Trump win
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE)
*  And welcome to a special Friday night edition of Hannity, the left in a state of rage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, after getting absolutely demolished in the 2024 elections, Democrats, they have [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=7.2s)]
*  two options. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=12.56s)]
*  They could have accepted reality. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=13.56s)]
*  They could have worked with President Trump. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  They could try to find common ground. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=16.52s)]
*  Nope. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=18.52s)]
*  Instead, they woke up on November the 6th, 2024. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=19.52s)]
*  They chose violence and anger and total rage. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=22.72s)]
*  They have been completely unhinged ever since. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=26.54s)]
*  Now, coming up, we're going to bring you the very latest from the pro-Hamas riots that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=29.36s)]
*  are taking place in American's college campuses. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=34.12s)]
*  Also tonight, she's back, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, once again, back in the news for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=37.8s)]
*  every wrong reason. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=43.38s)]
*  During a congressional hearing, she actually forced a witness to play a game she called, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=44.92s)]
*  quote, Trump or trans. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=50.16s)]
*  I'll explain straight ahead. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And later, Jimmy Fela will give his thoughts on New York's number one Trump hater, Leticia [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=55.12s)]
*  James, who is now in some potential legal trouble of her own and getting ridiculed by [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=60.8s)]
*  her own constituents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=67.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=68.52s)]
*  My question is for Tush James. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=69.52s)]
*  Will you apologize to President Trump for wasting millions of dollars and the state [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=72.84s)]
*  of New York for a witch trial and how does it feel to know that you're, you will be in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=77.44s)]
*  prison for mortgage fraud? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=83.92s)]
*  We'll check in with Jimmy Fela and also we'll tell you about our upcoming punch lines and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=85.36s)]
*  Patriots tour. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=93.6s)]
*  Tickets on sale today. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=94.6s)]
*  We'll tell you about that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=96.16s)]
*  But first, here is, and that's along with Fox Nation, a quick review of the current [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=97.16s)]
*  state of the Democratic Party. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=101.36s)]
*  Hours ago, several congressional Democrats, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, showed up [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=103.4s)]
*  uninvited at an ICE facility and breached the perimeter. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=109.12s)]
*  Apparently they wanted to secure the release of a violent criminal illegal. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=113.08s)]
*  One of those gang members detained inside. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=117.6s)]
*  This was supposed to be a bold political stunt in defiance of President Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=120.1s)]
*  But the Newark mayor ended up getting arrested while the members of Congress were ultimately [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=124.92s)]
*  granted a tour of the facilities. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=129.64s)]
*  Now, according to the U.S. attorney, Alina Haba, quote, the mayor of Newark committed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=131.56s)]
*  trespass, ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security to remove himself from the ICE detention [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=136.28s)]
*  center in Newark, New Jersey this afternoon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=142.64s)]
*  He has willingly chosen to disregard the law that will not stand in this state. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  He has been taken into custody. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  No one is above the law. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  Now, this is a truly pathetic party filled with all this anti-Trump rage, desperate for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=155.48s)]
*  attention, taken over by radicals. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=161.44s)]
*  But tonight, this anger isn't just reserved for Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  That's pretty predictable. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=168.44s)]
*  They're even mad at themselves, especially Joe and Jill Biden, that they have now thrust [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=171.0s)]
*  themselves back into the public spotlight. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=175.84s)]
*  But according to reports, the Bidens, they're broke. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  How could they be broke? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=181.84s)]
*  Anyway, with the family syndicate, anyway, desperately, they need a huge book deal to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=183.08s)]
*  stay afloat. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=187.44s)]
*  So they are going back to the well one more time. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=188.44s)]
*  And of course, they go back to the, you know, predictable trashing Trump while hoping that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=191.4s)]
*  Every American forgets about Joe's horrific track record as president and his full-blown [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=197.72s)]
*  cognitive decline. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=202.8s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, the Democratic Party's heir apparent, AOC, apparently she's been very, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  very busy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  Fight the oligarchy, flying around on private jets with Grandpa Bernie, talking about and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=212.32s)]
*  preaching about the evils of capitalism and climate change on a private jet. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=217.84s)]
*  Anyway, and then there's Kamala Harris, who is still clinging onto relevance during [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  a written interview with Vogue magazine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=227.64s)]
*  Kamala served up yet another word salad, this one in writing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=230.16s)]
*  I mean, no excuse on that one. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=234.16s)]
*  This time about artistic expression and the passage of time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  No, artistic expression and its influence on politics and its ability to, quote, shape [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=240.2s)]
*  the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=245.32s)]
*  And if you need to go where you need to go, you need something to help you to go to where [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  need to go so you can go and then go home. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=255.04s)]
*  And California Governor Gavin Newsom also working very, very, very hard to stay in the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=258.32s)]
*  limelight trying to say things he has never said or believed in nearly 30 years in the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  public eye. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=268.28s)]
*  I don't know, maybe he can get Elon Musk to give him an A.I. brain transplant. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=269.28s)]
*  Now, he's also now trying to distract from his abject failure as California's governor, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=273.4s)]
*  A brand new website dedicated to fact checking pro-Trump accounts on X. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  And just when you think that the left can't get any more petty and desperate, just think [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=285.24s)]
*  again. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=290.16s)]
*  This morning, our old friend, poor liberal Joe, morning Joe, couldn't find a nice thing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=291.16s)]
*  to say about Trump's big new trade deal with the UK. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=296.0s)]
*  In fact, they almost seem sad and disappointed that President Trump's trade negotiations [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=298.88s)]
*  are actually paying off, like eight trillion in committed investments from countries and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=306.64s)]
*  companies for the next four years. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=311.68s)]
*  Eight trillion. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=313.72s)]
*  All right, take a look. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=314.72s)]
*  Maybe there's a deal in Canada that happened. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=317.36s)]
*  The same thing with President Scheinbaum in Mexico. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=319.16s)]
*  I think you look for what's most likely most likely those trade deals are going to come [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=322.2s)]
*  from leaders that he's more comfortable with. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=328.12s)]
*  And he certainly, again, says he's very comfortable with Keir Starmer. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=330.6s)]
*  Yeah, no question there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=334.8s)]
*  President Trump diplomacy is very personal. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's the degree of that for most presidents, but this one in particular, it's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=338.0s)]
*  really whether or not he likes you. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a relatively low-hanging fruit. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=343.44s)]
*  If you can't get a trade deal with the longest-standing and loyalist United States ally anywhere in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=345.24s)]
*  the world over generations, you're going to be in trouble when you're dealing with some [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=352.04s)]
*  of the more obstreperous countries around the world. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=357.36s)]
*  It just is nonstop. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=361.36s)]
*  The state-run legacy media mob, Democratic Party, they just hate Trump so much. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=362.76000000000005s)]
*  They're so addicted to this hate, seemingly rooting for America. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  And that means all of you to fail. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=373.16s)]
*  They don't just hate President Trump. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  They also hate us, you, his supporters, and even other Democrats that don't completely [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  fall in line, you know, political differences no longer tolerated inside the Democratic [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=382.56s)]
*  Party. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=388.24s)]
*  Take a look at how they're currently treating John Fetterman. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=389.24s)]
*  They had no issues with Fetterman on the campaign trail, even though he was recovering from [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=391.6s)]
*  a very serious stroke. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  And by the way, he's done incredibly well. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=398.36s)]
*  Thank God for him. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, he was struggling to communicate during that campaign. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=402.04s)]
*  But now that the senator has broken ranks and he's doing a lot better cognitively, a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=406.12s)]
*  lot better, but God forbid he broke ranks with his party on just really a few issues [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=410.72s)]
*  on the borders, on Iran and on Israel. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=417.04s)]
*  That's it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=420.88s)]
*  Now the knives are out for John Fetterman, one hit piece after another, one attack after [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  another. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=426.28s)]
*  Now, Republicans are defending him. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=426.91999999999996s)]
*  They don't agree with most of the other issues. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=428.76s)]
*  Tom Cotton remarked, quote, John Fetterman and I have our differences, but he is a decent [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=431.08s)]
*  and genuine guy. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=436.2s)]
*  The radical left is smearing him with dishonest, vicious attacks because he's pro-Israel and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IRJLtBC9ZE&t=437.67999999999995s)]
