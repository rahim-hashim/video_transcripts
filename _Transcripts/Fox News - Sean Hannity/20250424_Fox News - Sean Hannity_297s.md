# 'HORRORS HAVE BEEN AFFLICTED': Democrats called out for border failure
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M)
*  Deputy Chief of Policy Homeland Security Advisor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=0.0s)]
*  our friend Stephen Smith is with us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=2.48s)]
*  What do you make of a party that has prioritized [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=4.48s)]
*  going after an illegal from El Salvador whose own wife [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=8.94s)]
*  in her own handwriting claimed he's a wife beater, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  that two judges designated as an MS-13 gang member [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=17.62s)]
*  and this is now their priority. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=22.72s)]
*  Their second priority is to help provide due process [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=24.9s)]
*  for international students that were supporting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=30.86s)]
*  a designated terrorist group called Hamas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=33.8s)]
*  Help me out. What is their end game here? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=36.74s)]
*  The Democrat Party has become the party of terrorists [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  and illegal aliens. That is the Democrat Party of today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=46.14s)]
*  Who does it sympathize with? Who does it fight for? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  Who does it move heaven and earth to protect? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=52.22s)]
*  Illegal alien gang members and foreign terrorists. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=54.36s)]
*  President Trump is leading a party for Americans, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=58.18s)]
*  for all Americans, for American citizens. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=60.86s)]
*  That's who he's fighting for and he's doing it [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=63.32s)]
*  with a determination and a passion and a focus [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=66.16s)]
*  and a commitment we've never seen before. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=68.84s)]
*  Let's talk just briefly about Tren Deragua, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=70.7s)]
*  the vicious gang that drills holes in people's hands, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=73.5s)]
*  chops off their fingers, murders them in cold blood. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  Again, based on information that has been discovered [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=79.18s)]
*  by FBI is even plotting assassination attempts [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=83.92s)]
*  inside the United States of America. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=88.18s)]
*  In just the last few weeks, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=90.86s)]
*  President Trump has found 300 ringleaders [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=92.7s)]
*  and top members of the Tren Deragua terrorist organization. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  They are the ones that are now in Texas [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=101.2s)]
*  awaiting deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=104.16s)]
*  stymied by judges, but Sean, they're going to get deported, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=107.14s)]
*  they're going to get sent home. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=110.78s)]
*  President Trump found them, 300 ringleaders [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=112.1s)]
*  and top executives of that terrorist organization [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=115.6s)]
*  in just the last couple of weeks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=118.94s)]
*  That is his level of determination [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=121.58s)]
*  while the Democrat party is flying around the world [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  defending gang bangers and terrorists. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=126.52s)]
*  I've been saying, and I always add, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=129.22s)]
*  I pray to God that I'm wrong, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=131.36s)]
*  that it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=132.96s)]
*  We now have, since Donald Trump has become president, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=135.86s)]
*  less than 100 days, over 200 known [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=138.64s)]
*  or suspected terrorists, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=141.32s)]
*  including one of India's most wanted terrorists. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=142.72s)]
*  So you explained to me that if that day happens [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=146.62s)]
*  and we wake up and we turn on the news [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  and we've been attacked, maybe 9-11 or worst style attack, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  they will have their blood on their hands. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=158.76s)]
*  They've allowed this to happen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=160.04s)]
*  Eddie, what's the estimate? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=161.84s)]
*  12, 14, 15 million unvetted Biden-Harris illegals? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=163.0s)]
*  That's a lot of people, known terrorists, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=167.84s)]
*  gang members, cartel members. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, how many more people have to die [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=172.0s)]
*  before these people get on board? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=174.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, at least that many, Sean. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=177.4s)]
*  So look, you've cataloged the horrors [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=179.34s)]
*  that have been inflicted, the rapes, the beatings, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=181.68s)]
*  the murders, the fentanyl deaths by the hundreds of thousands, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=184.38s)]
*  the destruction of entire neighborhoods in this country [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  because of the Democrat party's policy [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=191.18s)]
*  of open borders these last four years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned the threat of international terrorism [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=195.06s)]
*  that is on our shores. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  The millions of Godaways who entered [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=199.08s)]
*  under the previous administration [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=200.72s)]
*  on top of the millions more unvetted [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=202.08s)]
*  that were caught and released into the country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=204.5s)]
*  and the millions more that were allowed [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  to either fly into the country or overstay their visas. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  It is a clear and present danger [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  to the national security of this country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=213.56s)]
*  And we have federal judges telling President Trump [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=215.4s)]
*  that he can't deport these threats from our communities. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  This is the choice facing every American. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=222.58s)]
*  Either we all side and get behind President Trump [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=225.78s)]
*  to remove these terrorists from our communities [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  or we let a rogue radical left judiciary [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=232.5s)]
*  shut down the machinery of our national security apparatus. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  President Trump is going to see this through to his conclusion [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=238.4s)]
*  and we will find and remove every terrorist from this country [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=241.94s)]
*  and President Trump will make this nation [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  to stand for it ever before. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  And he'll do it over the fighting and opposition [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=248.88s)]
*  of the Democrat party, over the fighting and opposition [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=251.24s)]
*  of the communist left-wing judges, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=253.88s)]
*  over the fighting and opposition [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=255.66s)]
*  of the far-left federal bureaucracy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=257.22s)]
*  He will not be deterred, Sean. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=259.38s)]
*  He will see this through, I promise you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=261.1s)]
*  I'll tell you, if this is the Democratic party [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=264.62s)]
*  and this is what they stand for, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=267.86s)]
*  how do they possibly add voters to their roles? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=270.58s)]
*  Politics is about addition. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=273.98s)]
*  I don't think there's any America, this is an 80-20 issue. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=276.18s)]
*  But they doubled down on this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=278.76s)]
*  and it's not safe for the country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=281.7s)]
*  Anyway, Stephen Miller, thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzaYpMty9-M&t=283.5s)]
