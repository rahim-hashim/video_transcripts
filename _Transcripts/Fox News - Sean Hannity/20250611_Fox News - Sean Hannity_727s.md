# ‘LOST THE PLOT’: Hannity gives Newsom, Democrats a reality check on LA riots
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc)
*  Tonight, America's top Democrats, you know, the ones that were all obsessed about January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=0.0s)]
*  6th for years and years, they are doing absolutely nothing at all to calm tensions in major cities, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=4.7s)]
*  which have already been, you know, wrecked by looting and arson and other acts of violence. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=12.64s)]
*  Instead, similar to what we saw in the summer of love in 2020, they're just adding fuel [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=18.84s)]
*  to the fire with one recycled smear campaign after another against President Trump, the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=23.32s)]
*  talking points have now gone out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=28.8s)]
*  And almost everyone in the state-run legacy media mob, the radical left Democratic Party, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=31.64s)]
*  they're telling the American people Trump is a dictator, a threat to democracy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=37.44s)]
*  Democracy is in peril and on the line. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=43.2s)]
*  And don't believe the violence that you see day in and day out, night in, night out, with [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=45.88s)]
*  your own eyes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=51.08s)]
*  They are lying to you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=52.32s)]
*  They are cheap fake videos. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=53.64s)]
*  And the riots, they are mostly peaceful. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=55.56s)]
*  And everything is all Donald Trump's fault. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=57.92s)]
*  Now, we have heard these smears over and over again. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=60.04s)]
*  By the way, a lot of good, this did Democrats and the left-wing media mob during the election [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=62.88s)]
*  of 24. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=67.6s)]
*  Let's just keep lying to the American people and simply expect a different result. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=68.6s)]
*  That would be the definition of insanity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=73.28s)]
*  This is why Democrats lost in 24, why the legacy media died on November 5th of 24, and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=75.86s)]
*  they're officially dead. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=82.68s)]
*  Listen to them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=85.36s)]
*  They don't believe them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=86.36s)]
*  And for good reason, they don't trust them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=87.36s)]
*  Remember, these are the same people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=89.36s)]
*  They all lied. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=91.36s)]
*  They all said the border is closed, the border secure, and Joe Biden is his best self and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=92.36s)]
*  so cognitively strong. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=98.32s)]
*  And those are cheap fake videos that they're running about Joe Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=99.92s)]
*  Now, this time, the reasoning is even more ridiculous. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=103.36s)]
*  Apparently, Democrats and democracy is in peril for three things. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=106.8s)]
*  One, Donald Trump is enforcing America's immigration laws. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=111.28s)]
*  That would be the rule of law. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=114.92s)]
*  That would be his constitutional duty and deporting people who are here illegally, prioritizing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=116.24s)]
*  those who are convicted of heinous crimes, those murderers, rapists, known terrorists, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=122.44s)]
*  cartel members, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  And two, Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to protect federal buildings and federal [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=130.96s)]
*  workers from rioters in Los Angeles. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Three, the president organized a military parade to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=143.76s)]
*  Now, of course, every fake, resistant movement, they need an equally superficial leader. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=144.76s)]
*  And tonight, look who they've chosen, none other than the sanctuary state leader himself, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=150.84s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=156.2s)]
*  And Governor Newsom is desperate for the spotlight, loving every minute of it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=157.6s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean he's on the ground with the people and law enforcement in L.A., [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=162.6s)]
*  creating a movement to bring peace to a state's largest city. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=167.36s)]
*  No. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=170.36s)]
*  Instead, after spending the first few days of the L.A. riots getting into fights on X [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=171.36s)]
*  with people like me and others and appearing on every left-wing legacy media outlet in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=176.28s)]
*  the country like MSDNC—by the way, he even had time for podcasters. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=182.12s)]
*  Newsom got in front—and by the way, not big podcasters. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=187.56s)]
*  Newsom got in front of another camera last night to deliver an impassioned plea all against [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=190.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=196.16s)]
*  Talk about Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=197.16s)]
*  Donald Trump takes up more space in Gavin's mind than, you know, pretty much anybody ever [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=199.4s)]
*  has taken up in anybody's mind. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=204.48s)]
*  Although they did have a lot of audio problems, if you were watching last night, and he did [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=206.4s)]
*  look tired. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=210.2s)]
*  But he's not tired because he's on the ground helping the people of Los Angeles and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=211.6s)]
*  offering moral support to law enforcement. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=216.56s)]
*  Now, the governor was tired from all the interviews he was doing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=219.12s)]
*  The governor, who barred Californians from attending church, banned all indoor singing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  in 2020 while he himself was eating out French laundry, sending his kids to in-person learning [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=227.24s)]
*  at private schools. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  When everybody else's public school kids, they had to stay home. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=234.96s)]
*  He has now declared that President Trump is, quote, assaulting the First Amendment. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=238.24s)]
*  Now, by the way, nobody cares what people say. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=242.4s)]
*  It's what they do that we're talking about. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=245.24s)]
*  Newsom insisted, quote, the Founding Fathers did not live and die to see this moment. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=247.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  They didn't live and die to see states like California destroyed by people like him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=253.88000000000002s)]
*  Now, this dramatic, moralistic, pre-rehearsed tirade by Gavin Newsom was a response to President [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=259.04s)]
*  Trump's use of the National Guard and the U.S. Marines to protect federal buildings, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=266.12s)]
*  federal workers during a riot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=271.64s)]
*  We keep reminding you that as per sanctuary status laws in California, sanctuary city [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=274.16s)]
*  laws in Los Angeles, local law enforcement is not allowed to aid and help and assist [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  federal agents that they were the ones that were under assault. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  Stephen Miller points this out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  According to Gavin Newsom, this is what Founders were fighting for, rioters waving foreign [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  cars on fire, looting stores because Donald Trump is actually enforcing this country's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=299.48s)]
*  immigration law. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=306.88s)]
*  These are some of the criminal, illegal aliens. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=308.44s)]
*  Gavin, I've sent this to you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  You have it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  You've watched it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  You asked me to carry your speech last night. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=316.54s)]
*  Gavin, answer the people of California. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=320.6s)]
*  Call the families of the victims on the screen. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=323.8s)]
*  Put it up full. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=326.68s)]
*  So people can actually read it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=327.84s)]
*  You know, because you allowed this and aid and abet and assist these people, you give [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=329.84s)]
*  them free health care and education in your state of California. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  You and Democrats are fighting to protect people. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=338.84s)]
*  Yes, some of them are killers and rapists and gang members and child molesters. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  And Gavin Newsom and leading Democrats, guess what? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=348.0s)]
*  They're leading the movement to help keep them in the country as they sat idly by while [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  12, 20 million, whatever the number is, of illegal immigrants were entering our country [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  unvetted under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=362.56s)]
*  They're moving to states like California so they can get taxpayer funded education for [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  their kids and they can get free health care in the state of California. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  No wonder why they're borrowing money from Medi-Cal. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=375.76s)]
*  And by the way, other states contribute to health care out there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=378.2s)]
*  That has to stop. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=381.98s)]
*  Once again, Democrats are taking the most extreme, the most unpopular position imaginable. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  Look at this new poll. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=388.68s)]
*  Matt Towery, insider advantage. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=389.68s)]
*  By the way, this guy actually nailed the 2016 presidential election, 2020 and 2024. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  Fifty nine percent of voters approve of Donald Trump's decision to send in the guard to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  California. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=402.92s)]
*  Only 39 percent disagree. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  At the same time, 70 percent of Americans disapprove of D.C. Democrats. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=406.16s)]
*  And by and large, people just want simple things. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=412.08s)]
*  They want good schools where the kids learn reading, writing, math, science, arithmetic [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=415.2s)]
*  and computers. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=420.4s)]
*  They want stable jobs. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=421.6s)]
*  Oh, Donald Trump has 10 trillion manufacturing that will be created for prescription drugs [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=423.2s)]
*  and pharmaceuticals and chips and everything else and automobile manufacturing, all coming [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=430.04s)]
*  back to the country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=435.86s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=437.42s)]
*  We don't want men playing in women's sports, Gavin, and all you coastal elites cramming [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=438.42s)]
*  woke politics into every corner of everybody's everyday life. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=443.26s)]
*  They're sick of it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=447.42s)]
*  Gavin, nobody wants to be told what cars to drive and put in their driveway. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=448.82s)]
*  We don't want to be told we can't have a gas stove. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=453.42s)]
*  We don't want you to lecture us about our refrigerators, our A.C. units and the fact [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=456.46000000000004s)]
*  that most people don't want crappy paper straws. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=461.18s)]
*  We prefer plastic. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  They, you know, people want safety. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=466.38s)]
*  They want security. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=468.14s)]
*  They want a secure border. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=469.14s)]
*  They want a majority of Americans. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=470.58s)]
*  What everybody wants. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=472.66s)]
*  They want illegal immigrants deported. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=473.92s)]
*  I don't care if you come to this country. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=476.38s)]
*  I'm the product of immigrants. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=478.22s)]
*  All four of my grandparents came legally from Ireland. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  Go through the process. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  Do it legally. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=484.92s)]
*  I don't really give a rip where you come from. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=485.92s)]
*  Welcome to our country. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=488.5s)]
*  Give us time to vet you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=489.98s)]
*  Let's do a background check. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=491.54s)]
*  Don't be a financial burden on the American people and come in legally. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=493.3s)]
*  And by the way, Americans do not want illegal immigrants prioritized over the lives of law [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=498.38s)]
*  enforcement and the people in their state, like California. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  This is why I've been telling you generational, transformational, there's a huge political [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=509.86s)]
*  shift unfolding before our eyes in this country. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=515.7s)]
*  Democratic, Democratic Party, they have lost the plot. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=518.9s)]
*  Remember, it wasn't long ago, Democrats sounded just like President Trump on illegal immigration. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=522.3000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=527.82s)]
*  All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=529.82s)]
*  country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=534.4200000000001s)]
*  The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=541.62s)]
*  The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=545.58s)]
*  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=549.74s)]
*  number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=554.66s)]
*  by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=559.66s)]
*  We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=565.54s)]
*  It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=570.42s)]
*  of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=575.5s)]
*  Bill Clinton sounds like Donald Trump. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=583.22s)]
*  Boy, have times changed. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=585.86s)]
*  Democrats have since traded in sound policy, common sense for utter lunacy and insanity. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=587.86s)]
*  Listen to the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=593.9s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=596.1s)]
*  They're terrified. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=597.7s)]
*  They are absolutely terrified. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=599.54s)]
*  And that's, look, I remember a few stand-ups ago when I talked about what terrorism looks like. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=602.3s)]
*  This is it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=610.14s)]
*  There should be no question to what our country would look like had the Confederacy won. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=612.02s)]
*  We're seeing it on full display. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=617.54s)]
*  People being terrorized are law enforcement, the law-abiding people of Los Angeles that [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=620.14s)]
*  deserve to be protected by their government. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=624.5s)]
*  By the way, Mayor Johnson, he has a whopping 6.6% approval rating. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=627.42s)]
*  Great job, Mr. Mayor. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  Democratic Party, they are in shambles. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=633.18s)]
*  The DNC already holding a re-election for two of their vice chairs, including David Hogg, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=635.1s)]
*  after nonstop drama and infighting. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=641.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, his approval rating is at a 20-year low, 17%. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  Great job, Chuckie. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=650.42s)]
*  And today he ran from the cameras when he was asked about the violent riots. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=651.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=655.3s)]
*  Senator, what do Democrats mean when they say that the L.A. protests are peaceful? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=656.3s)]
*  Senator, what do Democrats mean when they say that the L.A. protests are peaceful? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=661.6999999999999s)]
*  Do you consider burning private property peaceful? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=667.4599999999999s)]
*  Now there's a guy who I know well. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=671.18s)]
*  He never ran away from a television camera his entire life. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=673.14s)]
*  Now tonight I do have some good news for the Democratic Party. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=677.62s)]
*  No matter how incompetent, unpopular, dishonest, weird and bizarre they have become, their [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=680.64s)]
*  friends in the legacy media mob, they're always going to have their backs. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=688.18s)]
*  And today, as per usual, predictably, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt forcefully, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=692.42s)]
*  powerfully confronted the latest smear campaign against President Trump. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=698.46s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=702.3s)]
*  So if there were peaceful protests on Saturday for the military parade, President Trump would [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=703.3s)]
*  allow that? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=707.78s)]
*  Of course the president supports peaceful protests. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=708.78s)]
*  What a stupid question. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=710.62s)]
*  What a stupid question. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFb_3Jbclhc&t=712.9399999999999s)]
