# Kid Rock predicts Bill Maher will say this about his meeting with Trump
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc)
*  All right, joining us now with more on yesterday's White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, dinner, music, meeting, Kid Rock. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=3.44s)]
*  What a cool idea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=6.88s)]
*  How did you pull this off? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=8.08s)]
*  How did you make that happen? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=9.38s)]
*  And this is one of those moments I would have loved to have been a fly on that wall. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=10.64s)]
*  Yeah, I heard that from a lot of people. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=14.88s)]
*  They wanted to be flies on the wall. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=18.32s)]
*  It's starting for me doing Bill's show and doing his podcast last year and again this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=19.88s)]
*  year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=25.2s)]
*  And, you know, he—they actually have things in common. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=26.2s)]
*  I've been with him and Trump as hard as they've been on each other, and Bill's been more than [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=29.319999999999997s)]
*  a little unkind to the president over the years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  And I've got a friendly with them both. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=35.6s)]
*  And I said, man, what if you could sit out and meet them and break bread? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=38.12s)]
*  That's one thing I've found in life is, you know, nothing gets solved when—and this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  country's so divided. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=43.8s)]
*  I'm like, what if we could just have some laughs, talk about some things we agree on, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=44.8s)]
*  and maybe just try to set an example for the reasonable people of this country that, you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=48.4s)]
*  know, it's okay to disagree on things and, you know, we can talk a little smack about [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=53.28s)]
*  each other, but at the end of the day, we're all on the same team. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  Well, we're on the same team. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  We live in the greatest country on earth, fair enough. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  But he's been a hard, harsh, harsh critic of President Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=64.92s)]
*  So you asked the president about it, and what was his first reaction? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=69.56s)]
*  He called me a couple times. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=73.8s)]
*  He's like, Bob, what the hell have you got me into? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=78.24s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=81.24s)]
*  And, you know, I talked to my—I said, Mr. President, I've talked to Bill. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=82.24s)]
*  You know, there's a—it was very nerve-racking for me leading up to it, because I'm like, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=86.2s)]
*  what if this goes terrible and things go sideways? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  It ruins a lot of my credibility with someone I consider dear friend the president. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=92.64s)]
*  But my heart was totally 100 percent pure going into this, just trying to do the right [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=98.2s)]
*  thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=101.88s)]
*  And Bill totally got it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=102.88s)]
*  Bill's like, Bob, I'm not going to sabotage something that could potentially bring us [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=103.88s)]
*  and maybe this country closer together. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=107.36s)]
*  I was like, Mr. President, he totally gets it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  And these guys, I was—my mind was blown. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=112.48s)]
*  That's all I can say is just how well they got along. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=115.44s)]
*  You know, we talked about things we had in common. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  The president, you know, gave us a great tour of the White House again, even the private [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  residence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  It was just—and then he even called me later that night. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Me and Dana went out after to, you know, smoke a cigar and just catch up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=128.16s)]
*  And much closer to midnight, the president called me, and it was—he was—he thought [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=131.16s)]
*  it went great. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=137.6s)]
*  So did I. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=138.6s)]
*  I go, that was incredible. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=139.6s)]
*  I go, I don't know. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=140.6s)]
*  Bring us all in that room, though. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you talked about things that maybe they did agree on, I would assume borders, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=144.64s)]
*  wokeism, things like that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=149.2s)]
*  Was there any disagreement at any point? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=151.56s)]
*  What was Maher's reaction walking in there? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=154.64s)]
*  My understanding is this was his first time, and he's donated a fortune to Democrats. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  He never got invited by any Democrat to the White House? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  I couldn't believe that when he said that, that he had never been invited to the White [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  House. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=168.76s)]
*  And not only were we in the White House having dinner, but then the president's like, you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=169.76s)]
*  know, he'd like to see the private residence. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=172.88s)]
*  I'm like, oh, again? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=174.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=175.56s)]
*  And Bill's like, I've never even been here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=176.56s)]
*  And it just blew my mind, you know, going up there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=177.72s)]
*  And he's such a gracious host. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=180.4s)]
*  You know how he is. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=182.92s)]
*  He's so fun to be around. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=183.92s)]
*  He's so pleasant, so funny, so smart. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=185.4s)]
*  Just a guy's guy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=188.84s)]
*  And, you know, and we're—all of us there are sticks and stones, guys. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=189.84s)]
*  So, you know, jokes, we don't care about that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=193.28s)]
*  Like, you know, a lot of these snowflakes over the years have been, you say one thing [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=195.4s)]
*  and they're all butt sore about it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=198.64s)]
*  And I'm like, we don't care about that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=200.04s)]
*  But it was just, it was incredible just watching B Coral. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=201.04s)]
*  Dana was sitting there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=204.72s)]
*  Dana's like, man, you did a great thing, Bob. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=205.72s)]
*  You know, this is a great thing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=207.4s)]
*  And it really made me feel good, you know, made me feel proud to just—I've been a very [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  polarizing figure in my own right, I get that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=212.48s)]
*  So just trying to do something good, you know, bring people together. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  You've been polarizing? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=219.76s)]
*  No way. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=220.76s)]
*  I don't believe that for one second. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=221.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=223.0s)]
*  Bill's going to go on his show. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=224.8s)]
*  And what do you think, based on being there, he's going to say? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=227.4s)]
*  I think he's going to say nice things about the president. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=231.56s)]
*  He's—no, he's not going to have a MAGA hat on and he's probably not going to vote—vote [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=235.88s)]
*  Republican anytime in his lifetime. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=240.6s)]
*  Is he going to hide his name until you have your outfit on? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=241.6s)]
*  Your evil, cannibal, you know, patriotic outfit. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=245.52s)]
*  Oh, oh, here's a fun story. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=248.28s)]
*  So I wasn't—so I was in the Oval Office with that outfit on, and so I brought a change [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=250.72s)]
*  of clothes for dinner. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=255.28s)]
*  That thing was very hot. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=256.96s)]
*  So I was changing clothes, but Dana told me, he goes, he goes, Bob, you missed it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=257.96s)]
*  When Bill Maher walked into the Oval Office, he was—he said he looked pretty nervous, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=262.04s)]
*  this, that and the other, and you know, the president said something to him real nice, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=265.6s)]
*  and Bill's like, I need a drink. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=268.36s)]
*  And the president's like, get him a drink, what do you want? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=270.52s)]
*  He said, I want a margarita. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=272.8s)]
*  And the president had his people grab a margarita, and that just—I grabbed a beer, and man, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=273.8s)]
*  we had a great time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=278.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=279.36s)]
*  So, go back to my question, though, and I interrupted you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=280.44s)]
*  He goes on his show. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=284.2s)]
*  Is he going to say, I really like this guy? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=285.92s)]
*  We had a really good conversation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=288.44s)]
*  We had a meeting in the mines. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=290.12s)]
*  Were there any points that they disagreed? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=291.44s)]
*  What is he going to say? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=294.38s)]
*  I believe he is going to go on his show and say nice things. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=297.16s)]
*  I think he's going to say that we still don't agree politically. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=300.6s)]
*  You know, it really freaks out Bill and the president's—when people are talking about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  a third term, this, that and the other, he brought that up, and the president, you know, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  they talked about it a little bit. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=308.8s)]
*  That was something that's—I would consider private. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  I feel uncomfortable sharing that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  If the president wanted to, he could. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  But, you know, we basically stuck to things that we agreed on. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=315.36s)]
*  And they both have extremely deep knowledge of American history, both very smart guys, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=319.6s)]
*  and, you know, very reasonable people, even though they've had this, you know, pretty [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  harsh relationship. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=329.8s)]
*  It was just—it was a cool—I'm like, if they can do it, maybe that family member [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=330.8s)]
*  you have with the—you disagree with—dissuaded you politically or that someone, you know, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=334.94s)]
*  social standing with a neighbor or somebody, maybe you can, you know, go back and be like, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=339.84s)]
*  hey, let's have dinner and talk about what we do have in common. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think it's a great thing that you did on every level. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=345.79999999999995s)]
*  What was maybe a moment that stood out? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  Something that you feel free to share, where maybe like Maher's reaction or something—I [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=354.84s)]
*  mean, you said he was nervous when he came in. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=360.32s)]
*  He had the drink that hopefully settled him down a little bit. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm not sure if he's allowed to smoke weed in the White House. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=365.96s)]
*  I know he talks a lot about that, although some people have, according to reports. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=368.36s)]
*  But in all seriousness, was there a moment where you saw a connection that you didn't [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=373.6s)]
*  expect? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, the whole dinner, the whole dinner, the tour around the White House, it was—I mean, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  the president was so engaged with Bill. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=386.56s)]
*  You know, usually, you know, Dana and I are very good friends with him, so, you know, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=388.48s)]
*  when we're in the room, he's usually pretty engaged with us, and he was so engaged with [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=392.32s)]
*  Bill the whole dinner. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=395.16s)]
*  Me and Dana just kind of sat back and enjoyed the show, and our minds were both blown. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=396.16s)]
*  How gracious the president was to have him there, number one. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=401.44s)]
*  I mean, that's a big deal, to have him there, to reach out and say—to let me reach out [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=404.0s)]
*  and say, hey, can I bring this guy to dinner? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=408.20000000000005s)]

*  Let's try it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=411.6s)]
*  I mean, and he was just engaged with him the whole time. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=412.6s)]
*  There was nothing negative. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=415.32000000000005s)]
*  Bill was really funny, too. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=417.04s)]
*  He loosened up. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  He was great, you know. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  He had some funny, funny jokes. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=421.04s)]

*  Very surprised, but— [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=426.76s)]
*  If you keep this up, you might be the next, you know, Middle East and European envoy to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=427.76s)]
*  bring peace, or maybe you can bring in the ladies of the view. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  That might be—that might be a fun moment, too. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=437.64s)]
*  That would be pretty entertaining, for sure. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=441.12s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=442.12s)]
*  No, not—I don't think they would be able to contain themselves. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=443.12s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  They'd lose it in front of them. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  Great thing that you did. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=451.0s)]
*  I'm glad it worked out. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=452.0s)]
*  Good for Bill for going. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=453.28s)]
*  It'll be interesting to hear his comments. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=455.04s)]
*  Kid Rock, always good to see you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMXrATu9Qc&t=457.24s)]
