# Commerce secretary: Someone is finally standing up for us
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw)
*  Here now with more. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick is with us. All right. What are we [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=0.0s)]
*  missing here? And I'm going to scroll all these countries that have been abusing and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=4.84s)]
*  stealing from us, as far as I'm concerned, including allied countries for years. And [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=10.88s)]
*  why have we let them get away with this for so long? Why are people saying that, oh, this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=16.6s)]
*  is terrible, that we were saying you can have free and fair trade, or if you're going to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=20.56s)]
*  put tariffs on us, we'll put them on you? How is that not fair? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=24.84s)]
*  It was just soft politicians. I mean, as president Trump said, it was the people in the Oval Office. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=30.48s)]
*  I mean, the European Union won't take chicken from America. They won't take lobsters from [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  America. They hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak. It's unbelievable. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  They won't. We can't sell corn to India. We can't sell rice to Asia. Why in the world [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=50.52s)]
*  do we let these people sell their cars? Ninety-four percent of cars in Japan are made in Japan. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=56.96s)]
*  They just block us. And finally, finally, the man behind the Resolute Desk, the man [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=63.96s)]
*  in the Oval Office, Donald Trump, is finally standing up for our farmers, our ranchers [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  and our manufacturers to let the world understand either they're buying our products or don't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=76.68s)]
*  bother coming here unless you're paying for the right to come. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=83.36s)]
*  All right. Let me scroll something else, and that is, since Donald Trump began this pressure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=87.28s)]
*  campaign and threatening tariffs, a lot of money has been pledged for investments in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=93.78s)]
*  our country. It's been pledged by foreign countries, $1.5 trillion by the UAE, $1 trillion, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  for example, by Saudi Arabia, Hyundai, $20 billion, $500 billion over four years, a new [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=106.06s)]
*  factory Apple is going to build in Texas, and they're going to expand out other facilities [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=113.02s)]
*  around the country. We have a Taiwanese company, Nissan and Honda, we're going to build plants [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=117.86s)]
*  in Mexico. They're now building them here, and I can go on and on. So I added up to be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  over $4 trillion committed only because of the threat of tariffs. I've got to imagine [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=128.46s)]
*  that a lot of these countries are not going to like the tariffs that go into effect tonight [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=134.7s)]
*  at midnight, and they're going to want to negotiate. You think I'm wrong? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=138.96s)]
*  No, they're going to want to negotiate. But these are the same people who have been ripping [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=143.66s)]
*  us off for all these years. Remember, the tariffs are only part of the issue. It's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=149.1s)]
*  these non-tariff trade barriers where they just won't let you trade. They provide subsidies [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=153.1s)]
*  back like they charge this VAT tax, right? And they always say, oh, it's not the VAT [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=159.5s)]
*  tax. You know what some of these countries do? They take that 20 percent tax and they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=164.5s)]
*  give it back to their producers so they crush our people. It's got to end, and what's going [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=169.06s)]
*  to happen is you're going to see the greatest renaissance of manufacturing in America, $4 [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=174.6s)]
*  trillion investing in America. That's going to create the most incredible set of jobs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=181.26s)]
*  Tradecraft is going to come back to America. People, you know, a high school educated workforce [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=188.3s)]
*  is going to get trained to do robot mechanic, you know, HVAC, but in high-tech, you know, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=193.74s)]
*  fabs for semiconductors. I mean, the coolest jobs, the highest paying jobs, they're all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=201.18s)]
*  coming to America, and Donald Trump is bringing them in because we're tired of having them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=206.78s)]
*  built in Taiwan. We're tired of having it built in South Korea. It's time for these [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=211.66s)]
*  things to be built in America, and these jobs are coming home. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=216.82s)]
*  One last question. When you talk to leaders and your counterparts in other countries, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=221.14s)]
*  they tell you privately, yeah, we think it's time to negotiate. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=226.66s)]
*  It's unbelievable when I talk to these people, they say, you know, I can't believe we got [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=231.66s)]
*  away with it for this long. I mean, seriously, it is outrageous, the conversations we have. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=238.78s)]
*  Of course they do. I mean, come on, they don't take our products and they sell everything. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=244.78s)]
*  Here's one quick story for you. In Korea, we started taking their cars in 2012 in exchange [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=249.78s)]
*  for us for selling produce and food there and agriculture, so McDonald's tried to bring [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=255.34s)]
*  in french fries. And you know what? They wouldn't let them take french fries because they said [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=260.34s)]
*  you couldn't prove the origin of the potato. Now that is the definition of a trade barrier. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=264.42s)]
*  I mean, you think that's a joke? It's not. They offered me last week, they offered to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=272.42s)]
*  take it away and let McDonald's take in french fries. That is absurd. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=277.66s)]
*  All right, Secretary LeTnick, Howard, good to see you. We appreciate you being with us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHG6t7H61Tw&t=282.46000000000004s)]
