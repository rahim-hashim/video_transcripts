# ‘LUXURY TO BE OFFENDED’: Comedian pushes back on woke ideology
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY)
*  All right, Tim Dillon joins us with more on a special and his pushback on wokeism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=0.0s)]
*  Tim, great to have you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=5.08s)]
*  I mean, just the name of your special, for example, you know, isn't that kind of like [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  a riff on pronouns? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=12.0s)]
*  I mean— [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=13.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=14.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=15.0s)]
*  I mean, you'll have to watch it till the end, the last joke in its reference. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=16.0s)]
*  But yeah, you know, listen, I think it's a luxury to be offended by something. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=20.0s)]
*  And I think for a couple of years, we were really into words, and people were offended [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=26.16s)]
*  by things, and like the Democratic Party made the last week of the election about a joke [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=30.84s)]
*  they didn't like at a rally that a comedian made. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=35.24s)]
*  And most people are concerned with real things like their safety, the amount of money they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=38.36s)]
*  have, you know, their families. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  And I think people now are relaxing, and they just want to hear things that are, you know, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=46.56s)]
*  and challenging, and they don't want to run away from these debates. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=52.2s)]
*  I think they're important to have. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=56.52s)]
*  And I think the Democratic Party got away from being the working-class party, and now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  they seem to be like the party of very coddled college kids and very wealthy people who have [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=64.64s)]
*  the luxury of getting offended at like a joke or something like that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  I call them the party of coastal elites, you know, and they've lost touch with hardworking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=78.88000000000001s)]
*  men and women and the people that make the country great. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=84.0s)]
*  They champion men and their rights to play women's sports, and they get all worked up [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=87.48s)]
*  if we find $150 billion in DEI, wokeism, transgenderism spent abroad. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  That's a constitutional crisis to them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=98.84s)]
*  They put the rights of illegals over the safety of Americans. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=101.12s)]
*  You know, I want to go into your profession, though. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=104.28s)]
*  I want comedians like you to have the freedom to say whatever the hell you want. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=107.44s)]
*  When I watch Chappelle and I watch Chris Rock and certain other comedians, they say what [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=114.88s)]
*  they want, and guess what? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=120.78s)]
*  I laugh because they're funny. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=122.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you have to agree with the comic. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=124.44s)]
*  I don't think you have to think that the comic is right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=126.52s)]
*  I think you just have to think that it's funny and that maybe it's thought-provoking. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=129.2s)]
*  And I think that's what we all try to do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=133.12s)]
*  When you look around at certain things in our society, you have to laugh at them, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=135.68s)]
*  I mean, like, they're absurd. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  And if you behave in an absurd manner, people have to criticize you, you know? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=142.96s)]
*  It's like, you know, I live in Los Angeles, and if there's not a city that's absurd [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=147.36s)]
*  as Los Angeles, you know, then I don't know what is. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's kind of a crazy place. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of the things don't seem to make any sense. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  So you've got to point that out if your job is to point things out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=161.68s)]
*  Isn't it, can you imagine, isn't it obvious why Fallon and Colbert and Kimmel are dying? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=165.72s)]
*  Because they just have an agenda. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=172.88s)]
*  You know, great comedians to me are going to just go for the laugh, and they don't care [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=176.96s)]
*  about politics. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=181.84s)]
*  They don't have an agenda up there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  And if you have the freedom to, like, I've noticed, I have not noticed you put a filter [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=185.16s)]
*  on anything you say. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=190.44s)]
*  So that kind of makes you unique. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=191.68s)]
*  And I think that's a big reason for your huge success. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=197.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, I try to say things I think are funny and or, you know, interesting, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=198.44s)]
*  and then they become funny. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=205.44s)]
*  And I don't care if people in the audience agree with me. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=206.96s)]
*  I'm not telling you who to vote for. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=210.36s)]
*  I don't tell you what to do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=211.84s)]
*  I don't tell you how to raise your kids. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=213.84s)]
*  I just point out things that I find to be insane. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=215.48s)]
*  And people look at that and hopefully laugh. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=220.84s)]
*  And that's the job. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=224.16s)]
*  I think the three guys that you mentioned are part of a system that has become a kind [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=225.32s)]
*  of unofficial spokesman for an establishment that people feel is, like, increasingly out [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=231.92s)]
*  of touch. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=237.74s)]
*  So a lot of what they do isn't funny. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=238.88s)]
*  It's become, like, a version of state TV. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=240.2s)]
*  And I don't think anyone should do that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=243.64s)]
*  I don't think anyone should do that for the current administration. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=245.88s)]
*  I think people should just go out and say what they think is funny. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=247.96s)]
*  And then if it aligns with something political, that's great. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=251.04s)]
*  If not, it doesn't. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=254.04s)]
*  But they shouldn't be a spokesman for something they should let people, you know, they should [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=255.24s)]
*  be funny and try to, you know, say what they think. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  They've taken shots. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=265.44s)]
*  Comedians have taken shots of me over the years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=266.56s)]
*  If it's funny, I laugh. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=268.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  I've looked on social media. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  People put up funny stuff about me. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=272.52s)]
*  When I see it and it's funny, I laugh. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=274.28s)]
*  I think people have lost the ability to laugh at themselves. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=276.11999999999995s)]
*  Is there anything in the back of your head when you're on stage that you won't say, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=279.28s)]
*  because, ah, I don't need that headache? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=283.4s)]
*  If I haven't figured out a way to make it funny, then I won't say it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=285.84s)]
*  But I don't think there's any topic that I won't go near. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  I just have to do the work to make it funny. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=298.84s)]
*  Well, you're doing a good job. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=299.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=301.44s)]
*  I think we need a new rule, and the rule's got to be comedians, they, no topic is off [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=302.44s)]
*  limits. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=308.88s)]
*  You can say any word you want to say, and if you don't like them, don't watch them [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=309.88s)]
*  or don't go to their show. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=314.72s)]
*  That's called freedom. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=316.56s)]
*  I'd like to live in a free country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=317.56s)]
*  Yeah, that is free. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=319.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=320.28s)]
*  Anyway, congratulations. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=321.28s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ac3tj-LIaY&t=322.28s)]
