# 'BEST NIGHT EVER': University of Alabama grads hear President Trump speak
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M)
*  University of Alabama graduates Megan Bonhouse and Hannah Adams are here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=0.0s)]
*  Ladies, are you a little hungover from last night? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=5.0s)]
*  No, honestly, I had a fun night. I mean that was amazing. Only the best night ever. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=8.0s)]
*  What did you take away from that speech? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=16.0s)]
*  I took away, he kept reiterating the importance of doing what you love and that is your path to being successful. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=20.0s)]
*  And he also said treat every day like it's a home game, which is very fitting as we go to Alabama. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=29.0s)]
*  I felt like we both sat on the front row and I felt like it was a very personal conversation that we were having with him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=37.0s)]
*  It was unlike anything I've ever been to and I'm sure you could say the same. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=43.0s)]
*  Hannah, what about you? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=48.0s)]
*  I think something that I really took away from is that President Trump believes in our generation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=51.0s)]
*  He told us to not let people look down upon us because we're young, but to set an example that we can be successful and pursue our American dream. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=56.0s)]
*  I know the University of Alabama has equipped us with the skills that we need to succeed and President Trump's address just affirmed that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=66.0s)]
*  Were there any anti-Trump students that turned their back or tried to throw their caps at the president? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=74.0s)]
*  You know, I do think I noticed I was just looking at my Instagram this morning and I posted about it last night and I lost a pretty good bit of followers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=83.0s)]
*  But you know, at that point I feel, but I really don't think that, I mean, the University of Alabama is a place where you can, there's all different walks of life. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=91.0s)]
*  You can speak your mind in whatever you do. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=102.0s)]
*  There was protests yesterday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=104.0s)]
*  They were able to protest in whatever way they wanted to. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=106.0s)]
*  So I really think that the fact that this was an opt-in event really made it so they couldn't really turn their backs in a way. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=109.0s)]
*  But like we hear them and we listen to them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=116.0s)]
*  But yes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=119.0s)]
*  Megan, what are you doing now with your life? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=120.0s)]
*  You've just graduated. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=123.0s)]
*  Do you have a job yet? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=124.0s)]
*  No, I actually applied for the internship at the White House, but I'm still waiting to hear back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=127.0s)]
*  But I'm about to start my MBA in Alabama for the next two years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=131.0s)]
*  I think there might be a chance someone could watch this at the White House and maybe put your resume closer to the top. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=136.0s)]
*  You never know how things are. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=144.0s)]
*  Hannah, what about you? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=145.0s)]
*  What are your plans? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=146.0s)]
*  I'll be staying here at Alabama for another year to obtain my MBA in marketing and sales and then hope to work in politics too. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=149.0s)]
*  Maybe in the admin or something here in this state. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=157.0s)]
*  Just wanting to serve our country and was so inspired by everything that President Trump said. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=160.0s)]
*  And it just ignited the fire in my heart to continue that part of service. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=165.0s)]
*  Hannah, do you wish you'd gone to Harvard? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=168.0s)]
*  Man, last night it's affirmed that I picked the right school for me. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=173.0s)]
*  I honestly wasn't sure where I was going to school right off the bat when I went through the college admissions process. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=177.0s)]
*  I looked at a bunch of different schools, but the University of Alabama stuck out to me and last night affirmed that decision that President Trump wanted to come to Alabama just speaks volumes of the prestige that we have here in the state and across the SEC. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=183.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=198.0s)]
*  Well, there's probably a place at Fox too. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=199.0s)]
*  If it doesn't work out at the White House or wherever else you guys want to check out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=201.0s)]
*  Roll Tide. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=207.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=208.0s)]
*  Roll Tide. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0nPrRyS0M&t=209.0s)]
