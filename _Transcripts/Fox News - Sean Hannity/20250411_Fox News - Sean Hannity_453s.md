# Sean Hannity: The left failed Americans on a spectacular level
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, after purposefully allowing millions of unvetted illegal immigrants to pour right [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=2.4s)]
*  across our wide-open border, Democrats, they now are outraged at a new bill that would [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  block illegal immigrants from voting. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=16.48s)]
*  I wonder why. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=17.48s)]
*  Anyway, Stephen Miller, we'll get his thoughts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=18.48s)]
*  That's coming up straight ahead. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=21.2s)]
*  Also, Stuart Varney will join us as one Democratic fresh new plan to fix America. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=22.56s)]
*  What a great idea. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=29.36s)]
*  New taxes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=30.36s)]
*  Bad idea. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=31.36s)]
*  Anyway, we'll end the night with the one and only Jimmy Fela for the other News of the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=32.36s)]
*  Day segment and our viral video of the day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=36.64s)]
*  He's going to give us a play-by-play of poor Peter Ducey and his harrowing encounter with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=40.28s)]
*  the bird on the White House lawn. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=44.96s)]
*  Also, by the way, told he has a message for Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, who apparently [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=47.36s)]
*  gave us more words of wisdom today. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=53.92s)]
*  And Jimmy will weigh in on Donald Trump's plan to increase daylight right here in the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=56.28s)]
*  USA. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=60.44s)]
*  But we begin with the left's new buzzword, chaos. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=61.44s)]
*  Is just creating economic chaos. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=66.0s)]
*  And when there's economic chaos, no one wants to make investments in the United States. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=69.12s)]
*  And you cannot run a country with such chaos, with such unpredictability, with such lack [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=75.7s)]
*  of understanding of what's going on in the world and the facts. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=84.96s)]
*  When there's chaos, already damage is done, irretrievable damage is done because of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=90.32s)]
*  chaos. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=96.52s)]
*  Apparently, the talking points went out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=97.52s)]
*  And now almost every elected Democrat and the state-run legacy media mob extension of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=99.74s)]
*  everything Democrat and radical, they're using the word chaos, chaos, chaos, over and over [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=105.32s)]
*  describe the Trump administration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=112.32s)]
*  They think so out of the box. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=115.0s)]
*  Anyway, since it's Friday and we're at the end of a very good week, allow me to be very [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=116.44s)]
*  kind to our Democratic friends and try to understand where they're coming from. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  After getting clobbered in 2024 and watching Donald Trump, let's see, restore order at [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=126.24s)]
*  our southern border in a matter of days, also bringing down the cost of everything from [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=132.26s)]
*  energy to eggs, also saving taxpayer money with Doge, $150 billion as of now, also establishing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=137.04s)]
*  the most transparent administration in history while now moving the country towards energy [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=144.84s)]
*  dominance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=150.76s)]
*  That means a lot of money coming into the country, getting all these nations to line [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=151.76s)]
*  up so they'll stop ripping you off and eliminating tariffs and $7 trillion in pledged investments. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=156.88s)]
*  Do probably feel an inner sense of chaos and despair. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=164.72s)]
*  The left failed, the American people on a spectacular level, voters, they rejected their [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=168.32s)]
*  woke ideology, their poll numbers have never been worse. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  And if this is not a low point for the Democratic Party, I frankly don't know what is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=178.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump has never looked better. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  He's fulfilling his promise to you, the American people, one after another, and he's getting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  results. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=190.04s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=191.04s)]
*  75 countries have now reached out to the Trump administration, eager to address the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=192.04s)]
*  trade issues that have exploited America and hurt our workers in the process. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=196.32s)]
*  The phones have been ringing off the hook to make deals. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=202.28s)]
*  And these countries wisely heeded President Trump's warning not to retaliate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  And as a result, they were rewarded with a 90-day pause in substantially lower reciprocal [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  tariff rates during this period so potential solutions can be achieved. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=218.68s)]
*  Billionaire Bill Ackman, who was initially skeptical of the president's tariffs, tweeted [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=220.24s)]
*  the following quote, by doing President Trump's way, the entire world and their citizens got [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=225.08s)]
*  the experience, the visceral impact of what massive tariffs would do to their businesses, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=231.44000000000003s)]
*  their stock and bond markets and their economies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  Now, we were able to learn who are the preferred trade partners and who are the problems based [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=240.4s)]
*  on who showed up early, what they offered and who chose to retaliate. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=247.16s)]
*  And I'll add one more important thing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=251.96s)]
*  Every country around the world now knows Donald Trump means business. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=254.44s)]
*  If he says it, he means it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=259.44s)]
*  He doesn't issue empty threats. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=261.2s)]
*  He's constantly negotiating and he's putting America first, unlike his predecessor, Joe [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=263.2s)]
*  Biden. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=268.52s)]
*  And now global trade will be set. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=269.6s)]
*  There'll be a new standard. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=272.36s)]
*  And countries that rip us off or try to or hurt our people or hurt our workers or cost [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=274.48s)]
*  you money, they're going to be held accountable. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=280.36s)]
*  For example, just this week, the president is threatening fresh new tariffs against Mexico [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=282.24s)]
*  for ignoring a decades-old treaty and stealing water from Texas farmers. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=287.54s)]
*  Now, of course, President Trump's bold style of diplomacy, well, doesn't just impact trade. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=292.76s)]
*  Iran will participate in fresh nuclear talks, direct talks with the U.S. on Donald Trump's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=299.88s)]
*  terms. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=306.88s)]
*  Pretty wise move considering the amount of B-2 stealth bombers that are now parked at [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=307.88s)]
*  Diego Garcia within striking distance of Iran and, by the way, also armed with bunker buster [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=313.28s)]
*  bombs. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=320.28s)]
*  You think an accident? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=321.28s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=322.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump's special envoy, Steve Woodcoff, he traveled to Russia today [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=323.28s)]
*  for a meeting with Vladimir Putin while the president now continues to apply pressure. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=328.2s)]
*  Quote, Russia has to get moving. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=333.2s)]
*  Too many people are dying, thousands a week in a terrible senseless war. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=335.56s)]
*  Putin should take note. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=340.92s)]
*  President Trump is now committed to peace in Europe, but he will make life a living [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=342.48s)]
*  hell for Russia's ruling class if Putin refuses to make a deal. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=346.52s)]
*  Now, Russia's BFF China, they are already feeling the heat. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  After steep new tariffs, compliments of President Trump, China's currency is sliding. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=356.04s)]
*  Now at an 18-year low, its already fragile economy is now hanging by a thread, and Donald [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=361.12s)]
*  Trump has so many more economic tools at his disposal. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=367.92s)]
*  Kevin O'Leary now encouraging the president to give China a taste of their own medicine. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=371.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=376.68s)]
*  There's billions of dollars trading this morning that I think Chinese companies that are not [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=377.68s)]
*  compliant, they're going to get delisted. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  I think this new sheriff at the SEC isn't going to mess around. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=385.64s)]
*  And I think this is important to continue the pressure on China to come to the table. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=390.0s)]
*  Delist these companies, make them be compliant like I am, and I speak on behalf of every [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=394.28s)]
*  American investor. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=398.28s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  And I don't know why this is going on. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=401.32s)]
*  I'm only asking the new chair, uphold the law. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=402.96s)]
*  Just uphold the law. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=407.96s)]
*  Yeah, great point. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=408.96s)]
*  And despite all the malignant behavior from the CCP, they still have two choices. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=409.96s)]
*  They can start being a good trading partner, free and fair trade, or reciprocal tariffs. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=415.26s)]
*  It's their choice. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=421.82s)]
*  They can come to the table or they will experience economic suffering on a huge scale. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=423.02s)]
*  China does not have any cards to play here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=429.18s)]
*  They need access to American markets. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=432.38s)]
*  And once again, President Trump, he has the leverage. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=435.3s)]
*  He knew it from the beginning. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  He's not afraid to use it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evrdK2yIMOw&t=439.53999999999996s)]
