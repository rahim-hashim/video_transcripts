# Charlie Kirk details Antifa attack on college campus: 'Destroyed our tables'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0)
*  Now on Thursday more violence from the radical left this time directed at turning point USA and their group on the campus of UC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=0.0s)]
*  Davis here with more turning point USA founder CEO Charlie Kirk [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's interesting we were texting what about a week ago [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=11.52s)]
*  And I kept saying you know it takes a lot of courage for you and your group and these young kids [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=14.9s)]
*  To be setting up in these hostile environments on college campuses, and you know lo and behold [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=20.94s)]
*  It's not the first time it's happened, but we'll show the video as you're speaking tell us everything that went on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=26.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's shocking stuff, and it's a pattern now. We're seeing this happening on more and more campuses [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  So at the University of California Davis our brave turning point USA chapter was set to host Brandon Tatum as a prove-me-wrong [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  Event goes up sets a table anyone can go and have free speech and dialogue if they disagree and Tifa showed up full-masked [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=43.68s)]
*  Black outfits they came in took our gear destroyed our tables basically [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=51.32s)]
*  Made the students had to flee and the police did nothing to intervene nothing whatsoever [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=56.44s)]
*  Our courageous students had such resolve and fortitude that after this incident happened [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=61.6s)]
*  They regathered and tried to do the event still about an hour later, but it wasn't the same of course [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=66.56s)]
*  This is after one of our turning point USA students at University of Texas Dallas [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=70.8s)]
*  Had a bike lock thrown at her and actually had to be hospitalized for this treatment Sean [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=75.8s)]
*  We are seeing a disturbing pattern from the radical left and we have data to now support it according to the National Contagion Research Institute [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=80.72s)]
*  48% of left of center respondents say that it's justified to murder Elon Musk [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=89.64s)]
*  53% say that it would be justified to murder President Donald Trump there are ballot measures in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=95.16s)]
*  California that are being measured by far-left activists that are being named [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  I should say after Luigi Maggioni we have to take a step back here and ask our question. What's really going on here? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=104.0s)]
*  There's a deeper thing than just political disagreement [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=109.84s)]
*  If you are on the front lines like our turning point USA students you are potentially putting your safety your well-being and God forbid your life [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  In jeopardy for simply being a conservative on a college campus [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=120.6s)]
*  All right, so in this case nobody was arrested the idiot Chancellor UC Davis was only quote [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=124.28s)]
*  disappointed and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=131.52s)]
*  Embarrassed you've got all this videotape evidence. We can identify [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=133.0s)]
*  I'm sure you'd be able to hire a private eye somebody to identify who these people are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=137.24s)]
*  There are some of them without masks on that are getting violent [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=142.04s)]
*  Why not identify them why not find out who they are and why not file charges against them? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=145.24s)]
*  Well two thoughts number one if Gavin Newsom really wants to make good on his like moderate appeal after I sat down with a podcast [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=151.12s)]
*  Hey Governor Newsom, how about you step up and do something about the fact that conservative students are being targeted at one of your state-funded [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=156.72s)]
*  Universities all I have and I'm waiting to hear back governor. Are you gonna do something about this? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=163.52s)]
*  So it's an open request now in front of millions of people. I know I know but hey now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=168.24s)]
*  It's time for action not just him saying that he wants to try to hear from the other side and secondly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=173.52s)]
*  I'm more hopeful and optimistic though that the Department of Education [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=178.32s)]
*  Linda McMahon is now going to put federal funding in jeopardy from UC Davis the Chancellor says well, we're gonna do an investigation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=182.48s)]
*  There's no investigation. We need arrests and we need the public identity [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=188.48s)]
*  Watch the videotape Chancellor [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=192.32s)]
*  You can go wear black block. Yes, exactly [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=194.32s)]
*  Watch the videotape [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=196.32s)]
*  This has no place on American college campuses. Exactly. It has no place at all [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=198.32s)]
*  Listen I give a lot of credit to you those people that are part of your group [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=202.32s)]
*  They're now literally putting their lives in jeopardy. Hey Gavin pick up your phone and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=205.68s)]
*  Text Charlie and tell him you're gonna do a full investigation and you're gonna find the people responsible and make sure they get held accountable [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=211.32s)]
*  According to your so stiff laws in California. Let's see what he does. My guess is next time you're on he won't have contacted you back [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kc9C05pJu0&t=220.32s)]
