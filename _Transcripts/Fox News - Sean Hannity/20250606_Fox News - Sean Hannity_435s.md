# See the magnitude of the mess Biden left behind: Hannity
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo)
*  And welcome to this special edition of Hannity. All right. So the magnitude of the mess that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=0.0s)]
*  Joe Biden left behind and how President Trump is now having a clean house. Well, I want [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=6.48s)]
*  to be really crystal clear about one thing, the sheer volume and extent of the unmitigated [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=11.76s)]
*  disasters that President Trump inherited. It's almost unthinkable. The economy in a [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=18.64s)]
*  complete state of shambles, massive inflation, prices up 20 percent, gas prices through the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=24.36s)]
*  roof. Growth was next to nothing. Few private sector jobs were being created. Wages stagnant, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=30.84s)]
*  consumer debt through the roof. American industry gutted. Interest rates tripled. And the border, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=38.04s)]
*  we endured a record level of illegal immigration anywhere from 12 to 20, nobody knows the exact [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=44.44s)]
*  number, in just four years, including, let's see, known terrorists. We have, oh, Iranian [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=50.48s)]
*  assassination squads. We have gang members, cartel members, human traffickers, drug traffickers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=56.64s)]
*  We have murderers. We have rapists. We have other violent criminals in this country, all operating [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=63.12s)]
*  inside our country with virtually no fear of deportation under Joe Biden. Overseas, Biden [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=69.44s)]
*  failed to prevent costly new wars on not one but two continents. No one respected, nobody feared the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=75.36s)]
*  U.S. after the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Our relationship with our allies in the Middle East [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=82.64s)]
*  was in shambles. Everybody worldwide knew it was a cognitive mess. China operating with impunity, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=89.92s)]
*  including, you know, over our own airspace. Remember the spy balloon? And back at home, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=97.44s)]
*  we had virulent anti-Semitism extremism from Biden's own base of his party. That was on the rise. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=103.04s)]
*  From college campuses to the halls of Congress, President Trump came within a millimeter of losing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=109.84s)]
*  his life to an assassin than another would be assassin later. And meanwhile, college campuses, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  they became nothing but hotbeds of bigotry, woke politics, infiltrating every part of American life, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  including our military and our schools. And let's not forget about the out-of-control bureaucracy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=128.56s)]
*  that waged a campaign of lawfare, censorship against Trump, his supporters, while also wasting [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  billions and billions of your dollars on broadband internet that failed to connect anyone [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=142.08s)]
*  and to anything and charging stations that were never built. And we spent billions on that and a [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=148.56s)]
*  slew of other bizarre left-wing projects, both at home and all over the world. Oh, and if they had [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=154.4s)]
*  their way, they would pick the car in your driveway. They would take away your gas stove. They would [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=159.52s)]
*  take away your plastic straws. They would take away your air conditioner. They would take away [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=164.4s)]
*  your refrigerator. So much for the pro-choice party. And as you can see, Trump is also facing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=168.08s)]
*  the challenge of a lifetime. But tonight, despite all of the noise, all of the hysteria, all the doom, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  the gloom, predictions from the left, well, we are seeing mass progress. President Trump is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=180.32s)]
*  fixing the country. Look at one item. Look at the economy. Trump slashing regulations, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=186.4s)]
*  unchained American oil and gas industry so America can aspire to energy dominance. That'll make us [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=192.0s)]
*  rich. A lot of high-paying career jobs for people. And of course, President Trump halting Biden's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=199.68s)]
*  expansion of government and the bureaucracy. And now look at the results. Take a look. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=205.84s)]
*  It's really exciting overall. And look, the real story here is the government jobs are down and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  the small business economy is growing and the private economy is growing. This is exactly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  what Donald Trump wanted to do for inversing everything that Biden had done. If we look at the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=223.52s)]
*  earnings from a month-over-month perspective, it comes in up four-tenths, up four-tenths. Much [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  better than expected. We're looking for up three-tenths. This is the third jobs they beat in a row, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=235.6s)]
*  right? The third time the president beat expectations in a row. He's created over [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=240.48s)]
*  500,000 jobs since he was inaugurated. And that's while cutting the federal workforce by 50,000 jobs [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  thanks to efforts to trim waste fraud and abuse. And amazingly, the very respected Atlanta Fed this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=248.88s)]
*  week says they're projecting 4.6% growth for the second quarter. Now, for the third month in a row, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=255.52s)]
*  the jobs report outpacing expectations, 140,000 new jobs in the month of May. Now, keep in mind, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=262.0s)]
*  those are private sector jobs filled by American workers. That is the direct opposite of what we [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=269.52s)]
*  saw under Biden. That's not all. Hourly earnings for Americans up a significant 4%. That helps [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=275.68s)]
*  against inflation that Biden created. And amid Donald Trump's tariff negotiations, inflation [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=282.72s)]
*  went down. Oh, went down to 2.1%, right where the Fed likes it. Maybe Jerome Powell will get off his [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=288.56s)]
*  duff and maybe he'll drop a full basis point and get the economy moving, which every other country [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=295.68s)]
*  has done. And get this, the U.S. trade deficit narrowed by a record amount. And by the way, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=302.56s)]
*  revenues from tariffs the last two months, close to $50 billion. Incredible news. The [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=308.72s)]
*  president hasn't even been in office six months. And that's not all. Border security, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  a tremendous success for the president, probably his most obvious success. We're going to have [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  a lot more on that with Stephen Miller. But look at these statistics. Border crossings remain [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=324.16s)]
*  at record lows. ICE just broke an arrest record two days in a row under Trump's new immigration [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=329.44000000000005s)]
*  directors. Violent crime is also way down under Trump, including New York City, Chicago, even [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=336.0s)]
*  Baltimore, where woke politics have been pushed to the side, while police are now beginning once [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=341.68s)]
*  again to abandon, defund, dismantle, no bail laws, and lock up career criminals and conduct all over [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=347.76s)]
*  the country routine street patrols. Oh, policing works. And through new executive actions, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=356.0s)]
*  President Trump is also forcing schools to ditch their own woke policies and also he's protecting [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=361.76s)]
*  women's sports in Title IX. And today, of all days on the anniversary of D-Day, it is important to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  note that under Donald Trump, Pete Hicks' leadership, woke politics, they are kicked out of our [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=374.0s)]
*  military. Instead, now the military is solely focused on war and fighting and protecting our [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=380.64s)]
*  country and liberty and freedom. As a result, the Biden era recruiting woes, they are now over. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=387.04s)]
*  Recruitment in every single branch in the military is now surging. Incredible progress in less than [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=393.36s)]
*  six months. Of course, the work is far from over. The president inherited a disaster under, you know, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  the president's leadership, the country thankfully is beginning to recover from these last four years, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=407.36s)]
*  the dark days of the cognitively impaired Biden are over and soon we could be headed [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=413.68s)]
*  for that golden age of America that the president talks about. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTlFaMpbRTo&t=419.6s)]
