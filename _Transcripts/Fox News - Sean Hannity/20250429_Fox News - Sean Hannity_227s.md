# Pam Bondi: If you’re betraying our country, we’ll find you
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ)
*  Here now with reaction, Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, a lot going on. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=2.56s)]
*  You've been a big part of it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=4.24s)]
*  A lot of what I'm talking about tonight falls into your sphere of influence here, and that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=5.76s)]
*  is not just violent rhetoric, domestic terrorism, threats of violence, getting rid of known [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=12.76s)]
*  terrorists and cartel members, gang members, murderers, rapists. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=18.48s)]
*  There's a lot on your plate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=21.96s)]
*  How do we get rid of them? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=23.8s)]
*  Sean, this is all at Donald Trump's directive, and this is what all of us have been doing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=26.84s)]
*  as a team since day one when he took office, Make America Safe Again. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=31.52s)]
*  We took out an ISIS terrorist in New York, right in New York, brought to justice the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=36.2s)]
*  Abbey Gate terrorist, started an October 7th task force, brought two illegals to justice [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  who ran one of the largest human trafficking rings in the country, dismantled a Sinaloa [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=48.96s)]
*  drug pipeline with a thousand pounds of meth, 17,000 fentanyl pills, 20,000 fake mollies [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=54.6s)]
*  with fentanyl in them that could kill multiple people, brought 29 cartel members back from [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  Mexico. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=68.64s)]
*  This is all at Donald Trump's directive, including Quintero, the guy that is accused of killing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=69.64s)]
*  Kiki Camarena, our DEA agent in 1985, and we got to call his widow and his son and tell [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=75.36s)]
*  them that Donald Trump is bringing this murderer to justice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=81.24s)]
*  They were both in tears, taking out MS-13 TDA members. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  Look at the signs behind me on the White House lawn of all these terrorists that Donald Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=89.8s)]
*  has taken off the streets. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  Not only that, the domestic terrorism, like you said, Tesla, nine cases in seven jurisdictions, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  and we have made it crystal clear, no negotiations. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  These people are facing 20 years in prison, and that's why it's going to stop. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  We're fighting anti-Semitism. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=110.6s)]
*  We had our first task force meeting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=112.24s)]
*  We are going forward on so many things. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=114.24s)]
*  And at President Trump's directive, we are making America safe again, especially by getting [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=116.64s)]
*  these drugs off the street. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  Today, Sean, is National Fentanyl Awareness Day, which happens to fall on President Trump's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=122.6s)]
*  100th day in office. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=128.56s)]
*  And it's pretty amazing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=130.92s)]
*  Since he's been in office, DEA has taken 22.2 million fentanyl pills off the streets and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=132.2s)]
*  seized, listen, 1,400 pounds of pure fentanyl. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=141.92s)]
*  This is 119 million lives Donald Trump has saved since January. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=146.32s)]
*  Pretty remarkable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=153.88s)]
*  And this is all this man wanting to keep America safe. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=155.28s)]
*  You inherited a department that was weaponized and politicized. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=160.44s)]
*  I would imagine there are holdovers in your department. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=164.88s)]
*  Can you identify and get rid of them? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=168.32s)]
*  Well, we're working on it every day. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=170.32s)]
*  You know, if you don't want to work for us, leave. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=172.72s)]
*  Get out of here, because we don't want you to work for us if you're not fighting to keep [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=175.4s)]
*  America safe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  We have a great national security division. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=180.4s)]
*  We are going to have great U.S. attorneys in place in every jurisdiction. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=182.68s)]
*  We're going to have great—we have great—FBI members, DEA, ATF. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=186.82s)]
*  U.S. Marshals. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=190.32s)]
*  And we are going to fight for this country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  Don't work with us if you don't want to. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=194.88s)]
*  And if you're betraying our country, we'll find out who you are and fire you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=196.72s)]
*  Just like we'll prosecute judges who are obstructing justice. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=200.64s)]
*  Pam Bondi, that is a lot of work, but very important work. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=203.84s)]
*  We've got to restore our country to its original purpose. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=209.2s)]
*  And thank you for the job you're doing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0ucWh_RPcQ&t=213.07999999999998s)]
