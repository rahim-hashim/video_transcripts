# 100 DAYS: Here's how Trump made good on his biggest campaign promise
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U)
*  A hundred days of history is in the books, a hundred days of political shock and awe, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump fulfilling his campaign promises, implementing the Make America Great Again [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=5.44s)]
*  agenda at a record pace, all while battling the Washington, D.C. establishment, the institutionalists, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=10.96s)]
*  better known as the swamp, the legacy media mob at the same time, pathetic Democrats, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=18.2s)]
*  that party, every step of the way. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  And tonight, the president was in Michigan for a massive rally commemorating the start [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=25.66s)]
*  of what he's calling a new golden age for America and for all Americans. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=30.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=34.58s)]
*  We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=35.58s)]
*  100 days of any administration in the history of our country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=41.1s)]
*  And week by week we're ending illegal immigration. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  We're taking back our jobs and protecting our great American auto workers and all of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=52.94s)]
*  our workers, frankly. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=57.5s)]
*  We're ending the inflation nightmare, the worst that we've had probably in the history [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=58.78s)]
*  of our country, getting woke lunacy and transgender insanity the hell out of our government. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=63.22s)]
*  We're stopping the indoctrination of our children, slashing billions and billions of dollars [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=73.5s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=80.0s)]
*  And above all, we're saving the American dream. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=81.56s)]
*  We're making America great again. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=84.2s)]
*  And it's happening fast, too. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=85.92s)]
*  What the world has witnessed in the past 14 weeks is a revolution of common sense. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=87.94s)]
*  That's all it is, really. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=93.44s)]
*  We're conservative. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=94.44s)]
*  You're conservative. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=95.44s)]
*  You're liberal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=96.44s)]
*  Whatever the hell. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=97.44s)]
*  You know what it's all about? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=98.44s)]
*  It's about common sense. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=99.88s)]
*  When you think about it, we're for common sense. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=101.12s)]
*  We've set all time records for the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=103.4s)]
*  I'm proud to be the president for the workers and not the outsources, the president who [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=109.44s)]
*  stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  Our golden age has only just begun. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=118.96s)]
*  We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=121.92s)]
*  We will never give in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=126.6s)]
*  We will never give up. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=127.68s)]
*  We will never back down. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=128.86s)]
*  We will never, ever surrender. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=130.84s)]
*  We will fight, fight, fight, and we will win, win, win. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=133.76s)]
*  All right, let's be clear. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=139.55999999999997s)]
*  We can't spend all night doing something the state-run legacy media mob would never [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=140.55999999999997s)]
*  do, and that's list the actual accomplishments from Donald Trump's first hundred days. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=144.6s)]
*  The president said it best. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=148.92s)]
*  If Democrats had their way, America, as we know it, would be over. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  We'd be a third-world hellhole, open borders. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=154.2s)]
*  That means more terrorists, more gang members, murderers, rapists, cartel members, and probably [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=157.32s)]
*  all likely on a path to citizenship. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=162.64s)]
*  America would decline into default and bankruptcy, and since the Trump-hating legacy media mob [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=165.52s)]
*  will never bring you facts, we're going to highlight the sheer difference between Democrats [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=170.48s)]
*  and Donald Trump's historic 100-day record of success. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=175.48s)]
*  Take a look at your screen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  In just this short period of time, the president slashed a record number of regulations. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=180.82s)]
*  He's making his middle-class tax cuts permanent. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=185.36s)]
*  He declared a national energy emergency. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=188.6s)]
*  No tax on tips. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=191.12s)]
*  No tax on Social Security. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=192.12s)]
*  No tax on overtime. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=194.0s)]
*  By the way, that includes offshore drilling on the energy issue, drilling in the Gulf [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=195.96s)]
*  of America, where just this week the administration celebrated the first production from a major [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=200.4s)]
*  new venture just off the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=206.12s)]
*  President Trump has also pulled the United States from the job-killing, cost-ineffective, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=210.54s)]
*  idiotic Paris Accords. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=215.76s)]
*  He ended Biden's liquefied natural gas export ban. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=217.64s)]
*  Now the cost of energy is down significantly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=220.96s)]
*  The cost of gas is down. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=223.92s)]
*  Mortgage rates are going down. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=225.48s)]
*  And to top it all off, Doge—that's right, those horrible people, they have already saved [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  you, the American taxpayer, over $160 billion in waste, fraud, abuse and corruption, and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=232.16s)]
*  they are still counting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=239.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, 26 American hostages have been brought home. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=240.76s)]
*  The hooty rebels are getting pounded. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=244.16s)]
*  Iran is getting squeezed financially, and they better make a deal, or they will regret [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=246.2s)]
*  it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=251.88s)]
*  The deal between Russia and Ukraine is finally—at least it's within reach, and for once a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=252.88s)]
*  real possibility. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=258.64s)]
*  Not a single U.S. service member has been killed overseas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=260.24s)]
*  And by the way, Donald Trump is finally holding China accountable while negotiating better [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=264.04s)]
*  trade deals with every country in the world, while getting the U.S. out of the corrupt [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=268.38s)]
*  World Health Organization and slashing USAID. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=273.0s)]
*  We could go on and on, and we still haven't even mentioned the border. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=276.88s)]
*  success in 100 days. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=281.32s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=283.48s)]
*  In less than 100 days, Donald Trump made good on his biggest campaign promise. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=284.48s)]
*  Joe Biden, well, said it couldn't be done. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=289.44s)]
*  He needed legislation. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=292.24s)]
*  He was wrong, as usual. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=293.7s)]
*  Under Trump, the border is not just secure. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  It is the most secure border in American history. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=298.52s)]
*  Take a look at these numbers from the DHS. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=301.84s)]
*  Daily border encounters are down a whopping 93 percent, and counters with gotaways down [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=304.12s)]
*  95 percent. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=309.4s)]
*  The migrant crossings are down 99 percent. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=310.88s)]
*  We went from 160,000 ICE encounters per month under Biden to around 7,000 under Trump, with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=314.52s)]
*  almost zero released into the country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=321.96s)]
*  And meanwhile, the deportation numbers continue to grow. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  And according to ICE, they have deported over 65,000 illegal aliens in Trump's first 100 [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=327.88s)]
*  days. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=334.0s)]
*  66,000 illegals, most of which have criminal charges or convictions, including nearly 500 [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=336.0s)]
*  for murder, 1,300 for sex offenses, and 2,300 gang members. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=342.24s)]
*  These dangerous offenders were roaming around your country thanks to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=348.32s)]
*  and Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=353.76s)]
*  And now they're getting deported, thanks to President Trump. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=355.76s)]
*  As the president said, it's about promises made and promises kept. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=358.66s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, President Trump is doing all of this amid nonstop, unrelenting negative [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  coverage from a corrupt, broken, state-run legacy media mob. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=368.84s)]
*  Take a look at this study, Media Research Center. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  Despite everything that Donald Trump has done, their coverage is still a whopping 92 percent [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=377.08s)]
*  negative, only 7.8 percent positive in his first 100 days. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=383.55999999999995s)]
*  We'll have a lot more on this petty behavior from the left. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ijbtZhgl_U&t=387.96s)]
