# How colleges are 'gaslighting' students
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY)
*  This now with reaction, senior senator from the great state of Ohio, Bernie Moreno. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Moreno, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=4.76s)]
*  I know as a citizen, as a father, as a grandfather, you see incidents like this over the years, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=6.32s)]
*  and you feel outrage and grief. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  But now as a United States senator, what do you think can be done? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=12.72s)]
*  A lot has to be done, Kellyanne. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=15.92s)]
*  We have to get control where this hatred is coming from. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=17.88s)]
*  It's coming from our universities, from our best colleges in this country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=20.52s)]
*  They're teaching kids to hate this country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=24.68s)]
*  They're teaching kids that Israel, our greatest ally, is the enemy, that they're perpetuating [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=26.68s)]
*  genocide in Gaza. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=31.96s)]
*  They're gaslighting these people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=33.64s)]
*  By the way, some people in that chamber, right down the street, came out in the Senate floor [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=35.4s)]
*  and repeated Hamas propaganda just the other day. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=40.16s)]
*  So when you have these mentally unstable people that are hearing these things, this is the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=43.6s)]
*  result. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  I think it's such an excellent point. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  In a country of 335 million Americans, Senator Moreno, we have 535 of you here, 100 in the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=49.8s)]
*  Senate, like you have 435 in the House. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=56.36s)]
*  And we can't do better than Ilhan Omar, or AOC, who I'm told is the leader for 2028, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=58.48s)]
*  who have laughed at anti-Semitism, who have said it's a fiction. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=64.8s)]
*  Ilhan Omar today can't even give us the standard doctrinaire. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=69.36s)]
*  Violence is never acceptable. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=72.86s)]
*  I'm sorry for the loss. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=74.2s)]
*  Two young lives snuffed out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=75.8s)]
*  She's just going to go to her car for a quote now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=76.8s)]
*  But I'm wondering what we do about the 31 Democrats who on October 18, 2023, in the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=80.44s)]
*  House could not vote yes for a resolution to condemn Hamas after they did what they [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=86.08s)]
*  did on October 7, 11 short days earlier. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  How do we actually root out anti-Semitism? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=93.72s)]
*  That's not free speech. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=95.56s)]
*  And political violence among the rank and file, I mean, will they be censured? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=98.4s)]
*  And again, what do you think the Senate can do in addition to what the president is doing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=102.88s)]
*  in defunding some of these universities that have not stopped anti-Semitism on the campuses? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=106.44s)]
*  Well, President Trump's finally doing something about it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=110.72s)]
*  As you know, he's going after these universities, going after their endowments and taxing them, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=113.08s)]
*  which, you know, they get tax exempt status, something no other organization in America [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=118.2s)]
*  that has that kind of wealth gets as a pass. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=122.84s)]
*  The federal funding, these organizations, these universities get billions of dollars, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=126.24s)]
*  so we need to hit them where it hurts, which is their pocketbook. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=130.92s)]
*  We also have to go into our schools and fix what our kids are being taught. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=133.88s)]
*  Our kids are being taught a lot of garbage by these teachers unions that have taken over [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=137.48s)]
*  our schools and brainwashed our kids. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=141.44s)]
*  So there's a lot of work to do, but there's also a lot of work to do for the voters. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=144.6s)]
*  They got to make certain that we send different people to D.C., not these career politicians [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=148.52s)]
*  that get away with saying all kinds of crazy things in the Capitol, and because they have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=153.52s)]
*  the Democrat media, the mass media that covers for them, it doesn't get reported. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, just the other day, one of my colleagues went on the Senate floor and accused Israel [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  of genocide. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=166.6s)]
*  They said that they've killed 50,000 children, that they refuse to allow aid into that country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=167.92s)]
*  I was with Israel's ambassador today. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  I took time out of my day, drove to the Israeli embassy to in person express my grief and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  condolences. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=180.84s)]
*  As you may know, Yehiel Leiter, the ambassador from Israel to the U.S., lost his son Moshe. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=181.84s)]
*  They could have bombed the place, the building that the terrorists were housed, but instead [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=188.16s)]
*  they went door to door, and the door for that particular day was booby trapped. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=192.2s)]
*  They lost his son. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=196.8s)]
*  Imagine the pain he felt then. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=198.56s)]
*  Imagine the pain he felt today as he had to make the call to two families to tell them [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=200.6s)]
*  that in America, not in Israel, not in the battlefield, but in America's capital, both [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=204.68s)]
*  were slain. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=211.12s)]
*  Well, you mentioned that President Trump for the second term is taking some pro-Israel [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=212.12s)]
*  policies, and that's correct, and rooting out anti-Semitism. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm curious, as somebody who did beat a long-term Democratic senator, Sherrod Brown, last fall, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  what would you tell other candidates who are thinking of running? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=226.76s)]
*  What should be the main messages as they run? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Should this be one of them? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, if you love this country and you've been blessed by this country, you've had success, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  go think about running for public office. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=238.56s)]
*  Don't just think, oh, somebody else is going to do it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  I think the days of business people sitting on the sidelines is over. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=242.76s)]
*  You and I talked about that quite a bit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=246.44s)]
*  You've got to lean in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  This is why I'm doing it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  I never imagined I'd be here in Washington, D.C., but by the way, it's a great honor. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm having a lot of fun because you can do a lot of great things, and we need more people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=255.2s)]
*  to come from the private sector to go into politics. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=259.76s)]
*  It's what our founders imagined. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=262.28s)]
*  They didn't want this permanent political class that always go with the wind. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=263.64s)]
*  So to the viewers out there, there may be a future candidate in Michigan and New Hampshire [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=267.76s)]
*  and Georgia and Minnesota, states that Republicans can win and will win in 26. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=271.76s)]
*  There's no greater cause than serving this country, and the person who showed us the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  way was Donald J. Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=280.36s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=282.24s)]
*  And so the big, beautiful bill is passed the House, and now I'm curious what you think [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=283.24s)]
*  its chances are in the Senate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=286.56s)]
*  Well, Kellyanne, let me just first say that I had the pleasure of being on the Senate [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=287.88s)]
*  floor today, hearing one of my colleagues ranting about it, and they said the following [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=291.36s)]
*  words, the problem with the big, beautiful bill is, and there was nothing that made any [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=295.44s)]
*  sense after they said that because they called the bill beautiful. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=300.58s)]
*  So President Trump's a marketing genius. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=304.22s)]
*  Look, we're going to make the 27 tax reform permanent. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=306.02s)]
*  We're going to reset the investment in R&D tax credits to 100 percent because that's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=309.5s)]
*  what stimulated the environment, the economy, gave us record revenue, something you'll [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=313.1s)]
*  never hear from the mainstream media, record revenues as a result of tax rate cuts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=317.7s)]
*  We're going to make those rates permanent. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=322.66s)]
*  We're not cutting taxes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=324.26s)]
*  We're just keeping in the same. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=325.62s)]
*  A tariff policy that finally resets our trade, workforce policies that make sense. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=328.38s)]
*  If you're an able-bodied American, do you remember who did that? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=333.18s)]
*  If you're an able-bodied American, you've got to work. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=336.21999999999997s)]
*  Bill Clinton said that in the 90s. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=338.58s)]
*  The Democrats are opposed to that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=340.78s)]
*  We're going to get this bill across the finish line, and look, we are ushering in the golden [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=342.5s)]
*  age for America. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=346.9s)]
*  The next six months and six years and 60 years of this country are going to be unbelievable, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=348.5s)]
*  and it all starts here with what we're doing in the next month here in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=352.9s)]
*  Senator Marino, you may currently be serving as United States Senator, but you still think [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=357.1s)]
*  and speak like a business leader, and I know you're a very successful entrepreneur in your [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=360.62s)]
*  own right. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  It's great to have you on set and great to have you here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YhVgtTsfY&t=364.90000000000003s)]
