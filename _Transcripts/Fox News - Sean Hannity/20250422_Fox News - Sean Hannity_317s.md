# Lara Trump: Dems are digging themselves deeper and deeper
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU)
*  of my view with Laura Trump right here on the Fox News Channel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=0.0s)]
*  Laura Trump is with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=4.2s)]
*  All right, so now we've got four congressmen on top of Senator Van Hollen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=5.2s)]
*  Why didn't Senator Van Hollen ever pick up a phone and call Rachel Moran's mother [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=9.76s)]
*  or Kayla Hamilton's family? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Why didn't he care about those constituents that were murdered and raped, that were really [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=18.16s)]
*  from Maryland and were really innocent victims? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=21.6s)]
*  It is the question of all question, Sean, the million dollar question one might say. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=26.2s)]
*  And you know, to see this group of Democrats descend upon El Salvador as if they are on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=30.52s)]
*  some incredible mission down there, we should all applaud what they're doing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=37.0s)]
*  It is ridiculous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=41.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=42.16s)]
*  54% of Americans in a CNN poll recently, by the way, said that they think that people [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=43.16s)]
*  who came to this country illegally broke our law to be here, should be deported, not the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=49.04s)]
*  least of which, of course, MS-13 gang members, which this guy appears to have been. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=54.24s)]
*  The fact that you've seen the Democrats stoop to this level, I think is shocking to everyone. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=60.04s)]
*  But they never learned their lesson, Sean. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=66.08s)]
*  They continue digging themselves deeper and deeper. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=67.72s)]
*  And you realize when you heard sort of your open there, it's never anyone else's fault. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=70.04s)]
*  You have Jim Clyburn saying that the mainstream media is to blame. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  It's not the message. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=79.48s)]
*  It's not that they have bad policies and bad messages. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=80.48s)]
*  It's that the media hasn't represented it well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=83.04s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=84.84s)]
*  The mainstream media has been the marketing arm for the Democrat Party and basically a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=85.84s)]
*  24-7 infomercial for the past eight years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=90.04s)]
*  But this is the new Democrat Party. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=94.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has beaten them on every single issue. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=96.4s)]
*  He won Handley on November 5th. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=100.56s)]
*  He won the popular vote. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=102.72s)]
*  He won every single swing state. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=104.0s)]
*  And now they are in disarray. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  They have no leadership. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=107.86000000000001s)]
*  They have no message. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=109.02000000000001s)]
*  They have no idea what they're doing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  So they're all down in El Salvador trying to get a guy who should never have been in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=111.8s)]
*  this country in the first place back in America. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=116.28s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=118.44s)]
*  So you were with the RNC and now you're hosting a hit show here on Fox. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=119.92s)]
*  We're glad you're back. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=124.36s)]
*  But you have the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee is saying pretty much that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=125.36s)]
*  if you don't, if you're not in lockstep with AOC, the squad, Jasmine Crockett and that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=131.2s)]
*  party that they're going to try and primary you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=138.92s)]
*  I'm perfectly happy with that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=141.92s)]
*  I don't see a lot of pushback. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=144.0s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries pushed back gently. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=145.56s)]
*  It sounds to me like most leaders in the Democratic Party want to go harder left. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  Thoughts? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  Well, and the problem they have too is anyone who was sort of a moderate Democrat at this [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  point won't even admit that they're Democrat. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I interviewed on my show Saturday night, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=163.2s)]
*  who was a lifelong Democrat who is now an independent right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=167.8s)]
*  And even he said it's because this is no longer a party of common sense. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=170.68s)]
*  When you get more and more radical and push farther and farther left, you're going to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  lose a lot of the country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=179.24s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happened to the Democrats. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=180.84s)]
*  So as the former co-chair of the Republican Party, I am all for Jasmine Crockett and AOC [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  being the representatives and the face of the Democrat Party. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  I suggest that every Democrat out there start behaving that way and start pushing farther [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=192.28s)]
*  left because Sean, Republicans will win in perpetuity. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=196.76s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=200.32s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=201.32s)]
*  And the American people have demanded common sense back. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=202.32s)]
*  Thank goodness we have President Trump back in the White House. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=204.6s)]
*  So you look at this recent poll in terms of potential 2028 presidential candidates, you've [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=207.64s)]
*  got both Kamala Harris, AOC leading the pack by a wide margin. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=213.48s)]
*  Both have plus 60 point favorable ratings. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=218.16s)]
*  And then a more moderate voice like John Fetterman, Stephen A. Smith, they have a net negative [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  favorability rating of 17 and 16 percent respectively. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=229.64s)]
*  Doesn't that kind of tell you everything you need to know about where the Democrats [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=233.28s)]
*  are in terms of rank and file also? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=237.84s)]
*  It seems like this is the direction that Democrats in Washington reflect, the people around the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=239.88s)]
*  country that like that party. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=244.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's their new party. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=247.04s)]
*  They are radical leftists. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=250.04s)]
*  And the fact that, by the way, you just commented on John Fetterman being the more of the moderate [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=251.04s)]
*  wing of the party. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm shocked too. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=258.03999999999996s)]
*  Sean, think that like even two years ago. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  But that's where they are. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  You know, you look back at the policies of, look at Hillary Clinton, who you just played [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  a clip from there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=266.4s)]
*  Look at Bill Clinton when he was president of the United States. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=267.4s)]
*  Their policies would actually fit in more so with the Republican Party now than they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=270.76s)]
*  ever would with the Democrats of today. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  And so this really is a party that's lost. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=278.64s)]
*  This really is a party who has no idea what to do. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=280.88s)]
*  So you can see them grasping at straws and doing crazy things like sending a delegation [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=283.96s)]
*  down to El Salvador, which I assume the taxpayers paid for. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=289.04s)]
*  So congratulations, America. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=292.28s)]
*  That's where your money's going. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=293.84s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=294.84s)]
*  I love my money going to such important causes like going after and bringing back MS-13 gang [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=295.84s)]
*  members as the term of not one but two judges. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=301.08s)]
*  Laura Trump, thank you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2P8A9T2hNU&t=303.88s)]
