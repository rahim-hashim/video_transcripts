# 'THAT IS TOXIC': DeSantis slams Demsâ€™ policies for 'destroying' Americans' quality of life
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc)
*  All right, so the Democratic Party's approval rating has plummeted since Donald Trump took [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=0.0s)]
*  office and as the party struggles to find leadership and direction on Friday, California [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=6.0s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom was forced to admit during an appearance on Bill Marsh's show [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=11.28s)]
*  that the party brand has become toxic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=15.92s)]
*  Finally, we agree. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  It took a long time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=19.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=20.72s)]
*  These guys are crushing us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=21.72s)]
*  The Democratic brand is toxic right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=23.04s)]
*  We had a high water mark two weeks ago and that was a CNN poll at 29% favorability. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=25.4s)]
*  It's dropped in the NBC poll down to 27%. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  It's one thing to make noise, but you also have to make sense. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, Gavin is trying to change because Gavin has started a podcast. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=37.12s)]
*  He's interviewing conservatives and it came up when he was talking to Charlie Kirk that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=42.12s)]
*  the word Latinx has never been used in my office and then he also added, he said he's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=47.0s)]
*  against men playing in women's sports when in fact he advocated for both positions and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=53.0s)]
*  he knows the word Latinx really well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=59.16s)]
*  Now, here's what he said when Charlie Kirk appeared on the podcast. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=61.4s)]
*  The Latinx stuff that, by the way, not one person ever in my office has ever used the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=65.8s)]
*  word Latinx. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=69.68s)]
*  So can we finally put that to bed? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=70.68s)]
*  We agree. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=71.68s)]
*  Yeah, but where did that even? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=72.68s)]
*  No more Latinx everybody. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=73.68s)]
*  Well, I just didn't even know where it came from. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=74.68s)]
*  I'm like, what are people talking about? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=75.68s)]
*  Would you say no men in female sports? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=77.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=78.48s)]
*  I completely agree with you on that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  It is an issue of fairness. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=81.84s)]
*  But the far left governor's past comments, they tell a very different story. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=83.68s)]
*  He had no issue himself in spite of denying knowledge of the word Latinx for years, using [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  it quite often. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=94.94s)]
*  I hope we can really paint a picture in terms of our consciousness of how impactful this [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=97.64s)]
*  has been on the Latinx community. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  About three quarters of renters in the state that have fallen behind in rent are represented [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  in the Latino and African-American community, the Latinx and black communities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=111.28s)]
*  You've got politicians that are banning not assault rifles, but the word Latinx. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=115.76s)]
*  They're not even serious. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=120.84s)]
*  And did he forget about this tweet from 2022 attacking Tennessee for pulling funding from [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=123.26s)]
*  schools that allow biological men to compete in women's sports, implying that this was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=128.64s)]
*  partly responsible for what he called a quote, rise in hate, maybe instead of political pandering, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=133.8s)]
*  disleading the people of his state. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=139.52s)]
*  Liberal governors could learn a thing or two from Republican leaders. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=142.48s)]
*  Earlier today, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a plan that he says would result [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=146.0s)]
*  in an average of $1,000 in rebate checks for every homestead, meaning if you live in your [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=150.96s)]
*  homestead and you live in the state of Florida, you lock in your property taxes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=157.4s)]
*  It can't go up but a small percentage every year. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=161.96s)]
*  And Governor DeSantis now joins us with more. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=165.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  So you have no state income tax. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  Now you want to maybe even eliminate property taxes or at least reduce them significantly? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=170.44s)]
*  Well, this year we want to do a thousand dollar tax cut for all Florida residents that have [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=178.52s)]
*  their primary residence here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  But to get rid of property taxes, you would need to go on the ballot and it's a constitutional [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  change. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=190.4s)]
*  But we are going to put property tax on the ballot to be able to give homeowners relief. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=191.4s)]
*  I mean, we've had people flood into Florida, the home values have gone up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  And while there's a positive to that, because people have built wealth, they're paying more [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=200.48s)]
*  and more in taxes. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=205.16s)]
*  And if they have to buy a new home, they're at a much higher basis. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=206.16s)]
*  And at some point, do you own your own property or are you just renting from the government? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  So we're really looking forward to this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  And just think about it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  We have the luxury of being able to do this because we can tax tourists, we can tax the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=216.48s)]
*  foreigners, we can tax non-Florida residents to be able to support the needs. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=223.32s)]
*  And so I really look forward to doing that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  And isn't that a contrast, Sean, with the guests or the cut you did with Newsom admitting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=231.12s)]
*  that the Democratic brand is toxic? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=237.44s)]
*  Let me tell you, that is not because of bad marketing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=240.0s)]
*  It's because the results of their leftism have been toxic. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=243.56s)]
*  You have defecation in the streets of San Francisco. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=248.04s)]
*  When you have a map where the entire city is covered in that, that is toxic. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  When you see tents all over Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles with homeless everywhere, that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=256.06s)]
*  is toxic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=261.68s)]
*  When you allow people to steal and loot $999 from retail stores without penalty, that is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=262.86s)]
*  toxic. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=271.76s)]
*  So they become toxic because they've destroyed the quality of life for millions of people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=272.76s)]
*  around the country in places like California, New York and in Illinois with their leftist [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=279.26000000000005s)]
*  policies. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=284.36s)]
*  And so people have voted with their feet. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=285.36s)]
*  They have rejected that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=287.22s)]
*  And now you see in these polling results, people are just looking at what they see. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=288.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the main reasons I had to get out of New York. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=293.26000000000005s)]
*  Plus, I really wasn't well liked that I had two governors, the current governor and the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=297.86s)]
*  governor before this governor, that said, if you're conservative, there's no place for [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=301.36s)]
*  you in the state of New York. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  And you welcome me with open arms and I'm very grateful. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=306.5s)]
*  There's a great story that only most people- [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=308.9s)]
*  And your neighbors do, Sean. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=311.29999999999995s)]
*  The people in Florida, they appreciate you being here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=312.7s)]
*  When you're out in public, people cheer you on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  They're not cussing you out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=318.74s)]
*  It's a great change for you and you deserve it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=320.64s)]
*  I don't have to be, you know, have my mixed martial arts mindset on 24-7. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=323.46s)]
*  It's great. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  This story may be unprecedented. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=330.24s)]
*  So the Biden administration gives you a billion dollars that you don't want because it has [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=332.48s)]
*  all these strings attached. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=336.56s)]
*  And you try to give it back and they wouldn't take it because they didn't know how to take [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=339.22s)]
*  it back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  But then you met with Elon Musk and he said, oh, I'll take it back. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=346.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I mean, our view is, is we're not going to take money and then have them [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=347.92s)]
*  change our behavior as a state to where we're adopting the woke agenda when our whole state [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  is based on the idea that we're fighting woke. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=360.16s)]
*  We say Florida is the place where woke goes to die. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=363.02000000000004s)]
*  So we didn't want to accept the money, but we said, hey, we're not going to accept it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  You guys want it back? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  They're like, well, we don't even know how to take it back. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  So we had this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  So I went up to see Elon a week or two ago and I said, here's the thing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  And he was like, you really want to give money back? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=376.72s)]
*  Oh, we'll find a way to do it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=378.48s)]
*  So I think within like a couple hours, they figured out a way to accept it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=380.0s)]
*  And so that is done. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=383.94000000000005s)]
*  So I would just challenge other states, particularly with Republican governors, if you have any [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=384.94000000000005s)]
*  of that money lingering over for those Biden years with those woke strings attached, don't [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YcHXEG5xOc&t=389.70000000000005s)]
