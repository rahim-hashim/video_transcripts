# 'NO TAX ON...': Trump reveals 'fourth leg' of his proposed tax cuts
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U)
*  Welcome back to Hannity. We are in Doha, Qatar, and here is part two of my exclusive interview [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=0.0s)]
*  with President Trump aboard Air Force One. We covered a lot of territory. Take a look. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=8.76s)]
*  There are many legs to your economic plan that you're laying out. One is one of the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=13.08s)]
*  trade deals. Second is tax cuts permanent, no tax tips, no tax social security, no tax [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=18.28s)]
*  overtime. Another leg would be energy. Interest deduction on cars. Remember that. That's big. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=26.0s)]
*  No tax on tips, no tax on social security benefits for seniors, which is so great. Think [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=33.4s)]
*  of it. And no tax on overtime. But there's a fourth leg that I think is really important [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=39.24s)]
*  of that, where middle income people, but any people, if you buy a car made in America, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=44.0s)]
*  only, I'm not interested if it's made anywhere else. I couldn't care less. But if it's made [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=50.0s)]
*  in America, you get and you borrow money to buy the car, which I guess 80% of the people [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=54.24s)]
*  do, you get a tax deduction on your interest payments. That's a big deal. That's never [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=59.52s)]
*  happened before. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=65.36s)]
*  A big deal for people that are buying cars. But that's a huge, that's a huge game changer [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=66.36s)]
*  for the car industry. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  Huge, I think. One part that you can't control, although maybe you really can because you [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=73.68s)]
*  have such influence with the Republican Party, is the one big, beautiful bill. You put out [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=79.4s)]
*  a big statement on that today. And how confident are you, having spent time with Majority Leader [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  Thune, Speaker of the House Johnson? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=91.72s)]
*  First of all, Johnson and Thune have been unbelievable. They've done a great job. Their [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  soul is into this. Their whole heart and soul. And they're working so hard. And it's always [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  tough when you have a very small, you know, we have a majority, but it's by, in the Senate, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=105.78s)]
*  three votes, and in the Republican, in Congress, it's seven. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  Now, it was one for a period of time. We won some elections in the meantime, but it was [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  actually one. So now it's seven. And I would say this, even before this big drug and, if [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=119.38s)]
*  you take a look at the cuts that I announced today, if you take a look at the pharmaceutical [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=129.9s)]
*  and drug cuts, they're so massive that I think a lot of Democrats have to vote for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=134.98s)]
*  the bill, number one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=140.94s)]
*  Number two, even if I didn't do this today, even if there was no such thing as these, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=142.66s)]
*  you know, 50 to 90 percent cuts, I mean, think of it. Where we're buying, you're selling [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  drugs in other countries for five times more than it costs in the United States. How horrible [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=154.17999999999998s)]
*  that is anyway. But that's going to be a thing of the past. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  You're selling them cancer drugs too sometimes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=163.46s)]
*  Yeah, everything. It's very unfair. Very unfair to people. They have cancer. They don't have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=165.78s)]
*  much money. They have enough money to get through this. But then they end up going bankrupt. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=169.74s)]
*  You know, people were getting themselves fixed up or not getting fixed up either way. And [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=174.38s)]
*  still, they were going bankrupt all over the place because they couldn't afford the drugs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=179.98s)]
*  But if they lived in a different country, they would have paid just a fraction. Think [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=184.06s)]
*  of how horrible that is. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=187.98s)]
*  Anyway, so I fixed that. Nobody thought it was fixable. And I fixed it. But even without [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=189.38s)]
*  that, I think we would have gotten the bill passed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=194.82s)]
*  With it, I think a lot of Democrats have to vote. I saw that a couple of Democrats said, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=197.82s)]
*  I'd like to be in charge of I don't know if you saw that. You have a couple of people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=203.18s)]
*  that go on your show that I assume are moderate Democrats without mentioning names. And both [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=207.98s)]
*  of them said, I don't know about you, but I think I'm going to be voting for this bill. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=213.82s)]
*  I think a lot of Democrats are going to be forced to vote for the bill because, you know, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  you add this new element that if this bill passes, you're going to get a 50 to 90 percent [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=221.73999999999998s)]
*  reduction in prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=227.7s)]
*  When you add that in, how does a Democrat not vote? I don't think they can win an election [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  if they don't vote for it. But even if you don't include it, I think that the Republicans [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=237.7s)]
*  are very unified and something would happen where they will get this vote. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=242.94s)]
*  I think it's imperative they vote. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=247.86s)]
*  But look at the Democratic Party. Look at the leadership that's emerged. Jasmine Crockett, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=249.74s)]
*  AOC, the squad, Grandpa Bernie. They seem to be the most. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=253.94000000000003s)]
*  Well, look at Schumer. He turned out to be a Palestinian. I knew him right at the beginning. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=258.02000000000004s)]
*  And I tell you what, Schumer has turned out, we call him the Palestinian senator, the senator [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=262.94s)]
*  from Palestine. No, Chuck Schumer is very disappointed. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=270.5s)]
*  Is he afraid to go against that radical base? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=277.18s)]
*  I think he's afraid. Yeah, I think he's I watch him. He's lost his confidence. Totally. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=280.18s)]
*  I just watched Chuck Schumer. I've known him so long. And he's in the other party. But, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=285.74s)]
*  you know, I've known the guy so long. He's totally lost his confidence. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=289.78s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. We're talking about the radicalism of the left. And what's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  really fascinating is you take up a lot of space in their head. And it's funny. You said, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  how could they possibly vote against lower prescription drug costs? But in the U.S. Senate, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=306.62s)]
*  the Democrats were championing the right of men to play women's sports. They've been the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=311.9s)]
*  party of fighting for the rights of illegals, even Trende Aragua, Abrego Garcia, et cetera. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=317.54s)]
*  They're the party that thinks it's a constitutional crisis that you and Doge have had nearly $200 [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=324.58s)]
*  billion in waste, fraud and abuse. They think that's a constitutional. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=332.06s)]
*  Yeah. Crisis. So you're asking how could they be that extreme? Aren't they that extreme? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=336.22s)]
*  Well, not all of them. I think you have a lot of them that they don't know where they are right [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=341.18s)]
*  now. I think they don't know what to do. Like men playing in women's sports. I saw a guy that I know, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=345.74s)]
*  good guy, Democrat. He's trying to justify two days ago on television, he's being hammered, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  and he's trying to justify men playing in women's sports. And it's sad. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=357.9s)]
*  I wanted to call him and say, you better get off that subject. That's not an 80-20. That's about a 97-3. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=362.5s)]
*  OK? If they talk about, you know, the famous, they always say it's 80-20. What's that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=370.38s)]
*  A lot of these things are not 80-20. Like transgender for everybody. Let's have transgender [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  for everybody, your kids, everybody. That's not an 80-20. They always say that's 80-20. That's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=381.41999999999996s)]
*  99-1, I would say. So, look, in one way, I don't like talking about it because I don't want to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  talk them out of it, because, you know, it would be harder to beat them if they were [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=393.26s)]
*  normal on things. It shows that they're almost insane. And they do suffer from Trump derangement [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=398.78s)]
*  syndrome at a high level. And I guess I'm honored by that. But I'll say this. Look, we had an election. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=404.38s)]
*  You were so wonderful to me. You were really an amazing professional. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=411.17999999999995s)]
*  It's not — it's — you did it for the right reason. You didn't do it for the wrong reason. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=415.26s)]
*  But you were so professional. And we won every swing state. We won the popular vote by a lot. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=419.26s)]
*  We won everything. We won a thing called that people don't like districts. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=426.21999999999997s)]
*  So, in the country, you have districts, thousands of districts. We got 2,750 districts versus 525 [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=430.46s)]
*  districts. Think of that. That's why, when you look at a map, it's actually a very important [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=439.5s)]
*  stat. When you look at a map, the map shows it's practically all red, the Republican Party. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=443.58s)]
*  And this is a big party. You know, we won — look how well we did with the autoworkers. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=450.3s)]
*  We won the Teamsters. The Teamsters were big for us. They were — the unions were big. The [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  non-unions were big. Right to Work was massive. But the unions — we won unions all over the place. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=459.58s)]
*  And we basically won workers. We also won people of common sense — rich people, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=467.5s)]
*  poor people, middle-income people. We won sort of everybody. You know, if you take a look at this [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  match — you know, we did great with Hispanic. The Hispanic people came to us like nobody's ever [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=478.78000000000003s)]
*  seen before. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=484.78000000000003s)]
*  Don't you think the Republican Party is now the party of working men and women? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=485.54s)]
*  I do. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=489.18s)]
*  When you put out the threat of tariffs, it was interesting. Between countries and companies — and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=490.38s)]
*  I would scroll the list on my TV show — pledging $8 trillion, trillion with a T, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=496.38s)]
*  in manufacturing. Chips, cars, pharmaceuticals, they're going to manufacture back in this country. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=503.26s)]
*  That was just the threat of tariffs. Now the deals are beginning to follow. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  So we're here for really two months, because it's three and a half. But you've got to give [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=513.58s)]
*  me a month to get ready, you know, make the Oval Office a little more beautiful and things [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=519.26s)]
*  like that that we're doing, right? But so we're really here, let's say, actively for two months. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=525.26s)]
*  So in two months, we have probably over $10 trillion committed. $10 trillion. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=531.5s)]
*  Whereas most presidents wouldn't have $1 trillion over the course of the entire presidency. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=538.06s)]
*  And if you look at this poor soul, this lost soul from the last presidency — and I say that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8WNtjxLH8U&t=544.62s)]
