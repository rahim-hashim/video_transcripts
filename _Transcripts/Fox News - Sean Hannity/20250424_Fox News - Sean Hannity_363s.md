# Newt Gingrich: Putin has totally misunderstood Trump
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA)
*  Here now with analysis, Fox News contributor and former House Speaker, Speaker Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaker, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=6.96s)]
*  A lot to get to. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=9.36s)]
*  I mean, what the president has accomplished in 100 days is, I mean, it's remarkable, his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=10.36s)]
*  energy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=14.32s)]
*  We talk about that a lot, but it can't be stated enough. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=15.32s)]
*  But overseas, Iran is a major threat to world safety and security. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=19.88s)]
*  Yet the price of oil is coming down. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=25.4s)]
*  The president is taking on the Houthis with Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=27.4s)]
*  They've been taking out the other threats, the other proxies in the Middle East. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Where do you think this is going? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=36.48s)]
*  Because Donald Trump has saved the world, quite frankly, by doing more in the Middle [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=38.0s)]
*  East over the last 100 days than we've done in a long time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=42.459999999999994s)]
*  Well, look, I think it's been kind of amazing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=46.72s)]
*  If you take the whole 100 days, remember, just before he became president again, we [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=52.12s)]
*  had people pouring over the southern border. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=58.64s)]
*  Within 10 days, that entire thing had basically been stopped in its tracks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  In fact, it's such a great success, it's now not a front-page story, because people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=66.48s)]
*  have said, OK, check that one off. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=72.4s)]
*  He is methodically replacing the criminals, as you point out, and getting them out of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=75.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=80.2s)]
*  He gave Israel the go-ahead to finish the job against Hamas, something which Biden had [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=81.64s)]
*  consistently denied them the ability to do. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=87.64s)]
*  He's really taken a much more aggressive act against the Houthis. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=90.72s)]
*  And part of that, I think, is to send a signal to Iran that we have not moved our heavy bombers [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=95.08s)]
*  into the Indian Ocean just for standing by. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=100.56s)]
*  And I think the president, although he says it very softly, he's trying to make very [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=104.08s)]
*  clear either the Iranians are going to give up their nuclear program or we are going to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=107.64s)]
*  destroy their nuclear program. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=112.36s)]
*  Obviously, the president very much prefers not to have to use force. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  He's trying to explain it directly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=119.32s)]
*  In the case of Ukraine, I think what's fascinating is this is just my view, but I believe that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=121.64s)]
*  Putin has totally misunderstood Donald Trump being patient. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=127.72s)]
*  And I thought today, when Trump snapped at Putin for having bombed Kiev yesterday, you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=132.34s)]
*  saw the really beginning of a turn. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=138.5s)]
*  For a long time, the administration, the Trump administration, focused on getting Ukraine [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=140.54s)]
*  in line. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  Now they're about, they're starting to discover that actually it doesn't matter what Ukraine [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  says. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=150.38s)]
*  Putin wants to continue the war. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=151.38s)]
*  Putin lies every day. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=153.26s)]
*  And we'll see what his conversation is like with Steve Wyckoff when he's in Moscow. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=154.82s)]
*  But frankly, I'm not very optimistic because I think Putin does not yet believe that we [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  will actually get involved in helping the Ukrainians. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=165.34s)]
*  And he believes he can talk and fight, talk and fight, and that we'll be dumb enough to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=168.86s)]
*  let him do it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  I thought today's statement by the president was a clear sign that that may be a major [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  mistake by Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  I think when Donald Trump speaks, his words actually matter because he actually follows [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=184.34s)]
*  through and does what he says he's going to do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=188.58s)]
*  And so going back to Iran, this is where I think the Iranians are getting the message, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  at least I hope they do, because it's not against the Iranian people, but the Iranian [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=195.9s)]
*  government has to understand that the president is going to make the United States energy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=200.66000000000003s)]
*  independent. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=205.62s)]
*  And when they drive down the cost of oil, guess what? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=206.62s)]
*  They don't make as much money. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=209.54000000000002s)]
*  They don't have the revenue, nor does Russia. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  And so when the president talks about drill, baby, drill, that is not just to help Americans [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=213.86s)]
*  and to help the world's safety, but it's also to get rid of the biggest threats that the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=218.94000000000003s)]
*  world has against using their nuclear bombs, whether they be Russia or Iran. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, and as you note, the president now is going to be visiting Saudi Arabia, and I think [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=228.94000000000003s)]
*  that that's a clear indication. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  He and the Saudis are lockstep on this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  The Saudis want to stop the Iranian nuclear program in its tracks. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=239.22000000000003s)]
*  The Saudis see their future in alliance with the U.S. and, frankly, in recognition of Israel [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=243.82000000000002s)]
*  and working together with the Israelis. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=249.18s)]
*  And I think you'll see an expansion of the Abraham Accords, which was one of the great [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=251.3s)]
*  achievements of Trump's first term. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=255.88s)]
*  So in a lot of ways overseas, he is making progress. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=258.82s)]
*  And we shouldn't underestimate, just because the news coverage is often so biased, there [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=263.18s)]
*  are things happening here at home that are amazing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  If you were to look at the total number of investments that are being made here, it's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=269.92s)]
*  astonishing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=276.92s)]
*  As you know, my wife, Clifton, has been nominated to be the ambassador to Switzerland, and she's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=277.92s)]
*  been studying in preparation for going to the Senate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=283.88s)]
*  And she pointed out to me yesterday there are two major Swiss pharmaceutical companies [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  that between them have announced $90 billion in investments in new factories in the U.S. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=294.16s)]
*  That's just two companies. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=300.36s)]
*  I think there are a dozen or more auto companies that have announced it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=301.72s)]
*  We're seeing the leading chipmaker in the world has announced a huge investment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=305.0s)]
*  I think probably there are seven or eight trillion dollars already committed to build [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=310.22s)]
*  things in America. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=316.1s)]
*  And I think you're going to see a lot more in the next six months. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=317.58000000000004s)]
*  That's the kind of thing that people are going to, a year from now, people are going to be [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=320.8s)]
*  talking about the Trump boom, as opposed to the nervousness that we're getting out of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=324.6s)]
*  all the speculators right now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=329.04s)]
*  Yeah, they have a hard time seeing two days in front of themselves. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  But I think you're right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=337.18s)]
*  By the time we turn the corner into the fall and into the winter, all of that good hard [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=338.18s)]
*  work is going to be paying off and it will help Americans across the board. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=343.24s)]
*  Speaker Newt Gingrich, thank you so much for joining us on Hannity tonight. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=347.2s)]
*  Do appreciate it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajty_OcXGaA&t=351.47999999999996s)]
