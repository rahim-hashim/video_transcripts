# 100 DAYS OF WINNING: Jim Jordan shares ‘biggest’ wins of Trump’s return to office
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ)
*  All right, here with more House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things I love about you, and I love a lot of things about you, is, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=5.16s)]
*  you know, during all of the many, many unfair attacks against President Trump, you usually [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=9.32s)]
*  had the most comprehensive list of anybody out there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=16.6s)]
*  You even beat me, and I pride myself on my listing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=19.72s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=22.52s)]
*  Go through what it means to you, the change in 100 days. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=25.72s)]
*  What is it like for somebody that had lived, you know, kind of in the wilderness fighting [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=31.36s)]
*  against a system that was stacked against you? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=35.68s)]
*  Yeah, 100 days of winning is what we've seen from President Trump and his administration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=38.28s)]
*  But for me, the three biggest things are the border is secure, military recruitment for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=42.04s)]
*  our armed services is now off the chart because they believe in our leader. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=46.76s)]
*  But maybe the most important thing, the third element is every single federal agency now [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=50.9s)]
*  works for we the people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  Instead of being weaponized against the American people, they are actually working for the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=58.18s)]
*  citizens of this country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=61.82s)]
*  And just look at the two we deal with mostly in our committee, Department of Homeland Security [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  and Department of Justice. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=67.25999999999999s)]
*  Under Joe Biden, the Department of Homeland Security set up the Disinformation Governance [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=68.7s)]
*  Board. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  We're going to censor Americans, tell you what you could say, what you could tweet, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  what you could post. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=77.66s)]
*  And under the Department of Justice was investigating moms and dads at school board meetings, telling [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=78.89999999999999s)]
*  pro-life Catholics you're an extremist. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=84.62s)]
*  That's what we saw there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  And today, what are those agencies doing? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  Deporting criminals, making sure our country is safe, as the attorney general just said [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=90.38s)]
*  a few minutes ago on your show. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=94.34s)]
*  That to me is the sharpest contrast. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=96.82s)]
*  Border secure recruitment up in our military and the government now works for the very [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=99.82s)]
*  people it's supposed to serve, the American taxpayers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=104.34s)]
*  Will you get to the bottom of everything that you mentioned that never should have happened, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=108.46s)]
*  the weaponization of the DOJ, weaponization, FBI, intelligence community, they've been [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=112.34s)]
*  politicized as well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=117.66s)]
*  Do you think we can clean these agencies out and restore them to their former greatness? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=119.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's already happening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=123.1s)]
*  We met with the attorney general last night with Cash Patel, with Todd Blanchett, the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=125.9s)]
*  deputy attorney general, and I told them, I said it is night and day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=128.98s)]
*  The difference between how you're handling things and what we saw under Joe Biden, Merrick [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=132.06s)]
*  Garland and Chris Ray. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=136.38s)]
*  I mean, when we send subpoenas now to the Justice Department, we get response, we get [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=137.66s)]
*  the answers, we get the documents, we get the information we are seeking. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=141.94s)]
*  So yes, we will get to the bottom of all those issues and help our Justice Department, help [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=144.9s)]
*  President Trump make sure we continue to do what we told the voters and the taxpayers [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=149.58s)]
*  we were going to do. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=154.22s)]
*  A lot of members look to you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=155.78s)]
*  We just had the majority leader on, the Speaker of the House on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=157.86s)]
*  Are you confident one big beautiful bill gets passed? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  Will Republicans understand the importance of getting as much as they can done now, understanding [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  the constraints of reconciliation in the Senate? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  Yes, because one of the fundamental principles of our party is we believe in allowing moms [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=171.84s)]
*  and dads, families to keep their money to go after their goals and their dreams. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=176.70000000000002s)]
*  If we don't come together and pass this bill, taxes go up on the American people and American [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=181.0s)]
*  families. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=185.28s)]
*  We as Republicans are not going to let that happen. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=186.28s)]
*  That is why we will stick together and get this bill done. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=188.78s)]
*  Alright, Jim Jordan, House Judiciary Committee Chair, great to have you as always, we appreciate [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=191.7s)]
*  it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVh79d5SyFQ&t=196.62s)]
