# This is what Biden's alleged 'cover-up' reveals about the legacy media
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=0.0s)]
*  And in a bizarre moment caught on video, French President Emmanuel Macron's wife appeared [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=3.0s)]
*  to shove him in the face as their plane doors opened in Vietnam. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=7.96s)]
*  We got more on that straight ahead. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=12.32s)]
*  Also tonight, the scandal around Joe Biden's cognitive decline and the ensuing cover-up [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=14.32s)]
*  is deepening. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=19.36s)]
*  Who knew what about his decline? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  What did they know? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=22.62s)]
*  When did they know it? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=23.62s)]
*  How bad was it? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=24.7s)]
*  And who was really in charge? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=25.76s)]
*  You deserve answers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=27.6s)]
*  The bombshell revelations from Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book are showing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=29.26s)]
*  just how far the Biden administration and people around Joe went to go to hide his decline [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=34.660000000000004s)]
*  from the American public. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=40.94s)]
*  According to the book, one Biden aide admitting the White House staff, quote, acted undemocratically [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=42.94s)]
*  because of their hatred for President Trump, while also telling Thompson and Tapper that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=48.18000000000001s)]
*  several senior political veterans work with Jill and Hunter Biden to run the show. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=53.94s)]
*  Fitting down with Fox News is Shannon Brema. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=59.06s)]
*  On Sunday, Thompson addressed these bombshell revelations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=61.18s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=64.7s)]
*  These aides were not even Senate-confirmed aides. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=66.10000000000001s)]
*  These are White House aides. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  These were unelected people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=69.78s)]
*  And one of the things that really I think comes out in our reporting here is that if [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=71.14s)]
*  you believe—and I think a lot of these people do sincerely believe that Donald Trump was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=75.78s)]
*  and is an existential threat to democracy—you can rationalize anything, including sometimes [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=79.44s)]
*  doing undemocratic things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=83.88s)]
*  Wait, didn't Jake Tapper say that Laura Trump was making fun of his stutter? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=85.9s)]
*  Nobody ever talked about Joe's stutter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=91.22s)]
*  In other words, their hatred of President Trump was so strong that they were willing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=92.94000000000001s)]
*  to act undemocratically while also claiming that Trump is a threat to democracy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=97.14s)]
*  They did that simultaneously. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=102.78s)]
*  They felt justified keeping Biden in power because they, not you, we, the people, determined [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=104.62s)]
*  that Trump was a threat to democracy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  Only their power on top of it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=114.58s)]
*  Now, one White House reporter telling Fox News Digital that this was, quote, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  a cover-up by any definition and one that included both public and private facing dimensions, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=121.1s)]
*  while a second reporter called out fake news CNN for refusing to cover the story that Tapper [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=127.86s)]
*  has now written about. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=134.45999999999998s)]
*  This level of hypocrisy should be shocking. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=135.74s)]
*  It should be alarming to every American. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=138.06s)]
*  This is what I have been telling you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=140.18s)]
*  The legacy media is dead. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  They just don't know it yet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=143.7s)]
*  Now, sadly, it's only par for the course from today's left. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  And while the Biden administration worked to hide his true decline from all of you, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=148.7s)]
*  they were aided by the legacy media mob themselves, who are now profiting in some cases on it, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=153.33999999999997s)]
*  who showed yet again how truly dishonest they are. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  They covered up Biden's decline while they claimed ignorance and pretended, ah, they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=161.98s)]
*  just didn't notice. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=166.14s)]
*  They said they showed you the real Joe Biden, but they did not. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  Right here on this show, we showed you the real Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=172.34s)]
*  We were criticized for showing you the real Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=175.06s)]
*  We showed what was clear, an obvious decline, and frankly, the national security risk that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=178.02s)]
*  came with it, having him in office, in the Oval Office, as, you know, posing to be the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=183.64s)]
*  president of our country. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=188.94s)]
*  Anyone that says to you they didn't see it, make no mistake, they're lying to you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=190.86s)]
*  And this is worse than Watergate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=196.9s)]
*  Yeah, Jake, fake. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=198.5s)]
*  It's worse than Watergate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=200.3s)]
*  This was a clear and present danger to the entire country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=201.86s)]
*  Not really funny. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  Who was in charge? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=205.86s)]
*  A few unelected Trump haters, usurping all presidential authority, and the media claiming [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=207.06s)]
*  to not see the obvious? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=212.82s)]
*  Now, that's beyond a threat to democracy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=214.22s)]
*  So these members of the legacy media mob, claiming to be fair and balanced and journalists, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=217.1s)]
*  are anything but. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=222.02s)]
*  We'll talk about Scott Pelley later. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=223.02s)]
*  And their agenda has now forever been revealed, and they have lost the trust, rightly so, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=225.34s)]
*  of the American people that ignored them all throughout the 2024 campaign and are ignoring [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  them today. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=236.54s)]
*  They would rather hide Biden's decline from the American public because they decided that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  it was better than Donald Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=243.57999999999998s)]
*  And by covering up his cognitive decline, they showed themselves to be the true threat [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=245.78s)]
*  to democracy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=250.22s)]
*  Imagine if the roles were reversed and this was President Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  You would never, ever, ever hear the end of it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=255.22s)]
*  Between the Biden cover-up, their morally indefensible ideological stances, it's no [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=259.02s)]
*  wonder people are fleeing the left en masse. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=263.98s)]
*  So they've come up with a solution to bring young men back to the party that it is already [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=267.46s)]
*  facing, by the way, widespread mockery. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=273.06s)]
*  They are spending a whopping $20 million on a bizarre American men's study to try [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=275.66s)]
*  and recover their losses from November. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=282.38000000000005s)]
*  This study highlights the core of the left's problem, a never-ending obsession with identity [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=285.18s)]
*  politics. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  According to reports, one aspect will involve studying the syntax, language and content [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  that gains attention and virality in these spaces. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=298.42s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=303.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=304.3s)]
*  Hey, bro, how are you? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=305.94s)]
*  Would you like to get a beer, Joe? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=307.74s)]
*  Hey, Joe, did you see the game the other night? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what does that mean? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=311.62s)]
*  Well, also advising, you know, rolling out these pro-democratic ads, they want to put [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=314.38s)]
*  them in video games because young men, they think, play video games and they would care [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=319.06s)]
*  about the commercial that they're running during their video game, which they will find [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=323.62s)]
*  annoying in all likelihood. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  But the problems for Democrats are only going to get worse as the party embraces far more [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=329.86s)]
*  infighting ahead of the 2028 nomination. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  Even the Atlantic is sounding the alarm about the incoming political civil war in the Democratic [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=337.86s)]
*  Party. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=342.66s)]
*  In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, former Chicago Mayor Rom Rombo deadfished [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=343.66s)]
*  Emmanuel, he's back. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=348.1s)]
*  He called the Democratic Party weak and woke. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=349.46000000000004s)]
*  This is the same guy. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=352.26s)]
*  He what? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=353.26s)]
*  He served two terms as mayor of Chicago. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=354.26s)]
*  He did not lift a finger to address the never-ending violence in Chicago. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=356.64s)]
*  He clearly didn't fix it, but now appears to be laying the groundwork for a run in 2028. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=361.74s)]
*  He is going to run to the center. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=367.3s)]
*  All right, fair enough, except it does not coincide with the reality of his political [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=369.22s)]
*  life. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=374.46000000000004s)]
*  But the radical left continues to dominate the party. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  Look at this new poll. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=377.94s)]
*  Squad member AOC would absolutely trounce Chuckie Schumer by 21 points in a New York [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=378.94s)]
*  primary. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  Run, AOC, run. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  And right now, the loudest voice in the Democratic Party is Jasmine Crockett. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=389.42s)]
*  Oh, he liked Jasmine Crockett on the show, because she makes the Democrats look so great [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  and continues to make headlines for all the wrong reasons. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=398.66s)]
*  Here's what she said following President Trump's speech at West Point. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=401.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he literally sounds like someone who was broken out of the insane asylum. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  Like, he'd just be all over the place. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=411.98s)]
*  Talk about mental acuity. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVfBrftUsfg&t=415.1s)]
