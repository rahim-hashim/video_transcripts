# ‘TRAIN WRECK MAYOR’: Kristi Noem slams LA official
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg)
*  And joining us now is Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary Noem, thank you for being with us. We appreciate it. One of the biggest [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=4.2s)]
*  problems we have here is when you look at a state like California in their [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=9.0s)]
*  sanctuary status, there are handcuffs on local law enforcement. You know, for [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=12.9s)]
*  example, and I talked about this a little bit in my opening monologue, and you know, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=17.64s)]
*  for example, they, state and local police officers, are prohibited from even [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=21.68s)]
*  inquiring about one's immigration status during a routine course of their work. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=26.2s)]
*  In state and local law enforcement, officers are forbidden from holding [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=32.04s)]
*  illegal immigrants until they can be transferred to federal custody. Now, and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=37.08s)]
*  and federal agencies are prohibited from commandeering local authorities. So there [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=42.44s)]
*  there is a real, the stranglehold in terms of local law enforcement being able [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=47.28s)]
*  to do their job, even those that would want to support ICE and in their mission [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=53.8s)]
*  to keep Californians safe. What's your reaction to that? Yeah, you're exactly right, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=59.16s)]
*  Sean, and I would say that most of these law enforcement officers in those [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  sanctuary states are very unhappy with the policies that they have to follow [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=66.56s)]
*  because they want to be there to back up other law enforcement officers. They want [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=70.2s)]
*  to be there to help make their communities safer and to get these bad [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=74.24s)]
*  criminals out of their states and out of this country. In LA, what we have been [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=78.0s)]
*  going after is the worst of the worst. They're murderers. They're people who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=83.32s)]
*  have been perpetuating assault and trafficking human beings and drugs and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=88.36s)]
*  been devastating these communities for years and they are so anxious to see [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=92.88s)]
*  people in be able to raise their families in a safe state again and make [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=97.32s)]
*  California a fantastic place to be and to have a future, but that is not what [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=101.28s)]
*  happens under the leadership of Gavin Newsom. And so right now our ICE agents [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=106.24s)]
*  are there. They're doing their work. They're following through on exactly what [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=111.68s)]
*  President Trump said that he would do and they're doing it with the backup of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=114.68s)]
*  National Guard. The National Guard that has been deployed under federal 10, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  which is federal status, which is completely authorized and a status in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=121.76s)]
*  which can help make America safe again. Okay, but we're talking, you say the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=126.28s)]
*  worst of the worst. You're talking about murderers and rapists here. We're not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=131.52s)]
*  talking about... Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Sean, those are the people we're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  going after. I mean, those are our targets. Today we had over four to five [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=140.0s)]
*  hundred targets we were going after that were known members of gangs in LA that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=143.84s)]
*  have been victimizing people for years that Gavin Newsom has done absolutely [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=148.56s)]
*  nothing about, that Mayor Bass has done absolutely nothing about. Listen, I served [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=153.32s)]
*  with her in Congress before she was ever mayor and she is a train wreck of a mayor [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=157.04s)]
*  now that is endorsing these kind of activities, has allowed her city to be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=161.8s)]
*  completely devastated with crime and now she's holding press conferences [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=166.38s)]
*  talking about the fact that people have the right to peacefully protest and that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=170.7s)]
*  they're a city of immigrants. Well, they're not a city of immigrants, they're a city [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=174.7s)]
*  of criminals because she has protected them for so many years and so we're [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=177.9s)]
*  coming in and doing what the president has said that he's going to do and he's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=181.74s)]
*  going to allow people to live in a safe community again and we're going to use [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  the authority that he has as president of the United States to conduct these [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  operations and the more that people conduct violence against law enforcement [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=194.38s)]
*  officers, boy, we're going to hit them back and we're going to hit them back [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=197.62s)]
*  harder than we ever have before and we conducted more operations today than we [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=201.14s)]
*  did the day before and tomorrow we're going to double those efforts again. The [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=205.66s)]
*  more that they protest and commit acts of violence against law enforcement [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=209.7s)]
*  officers, the harder ICE is going to come after them because these people are [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=214.38s)]
*  patriots, these ICE officers are people who are fighting for their country and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=218.14s)]
*  I'm so proud of them. They've acted with dignity, they've acted with grace under [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  stressful situations and when they've been disrespected, they've responded [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=227.17999999999998s)]
*  appropriately under the law to make sure that they were treating every single [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  individual the same and making sure that due process was followed and that they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=235.26s)]
*  were doing their jobs. So this is an unfortunate situation that we see [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=239.61999999999998s)]
*  violence and instigators out there but the President Trump is really dedicated [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=243.98s)]
*  to bringing peace again. As cars have been burning and agitators have been [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=249.3s)]
*  attacking police and law enforcement and ICE agents, if you turn on fake news [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=253.94s)]
*  CNN or MSDNC or you listen to Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Maxine Waters, we [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=259.58s)]
*  keep here in the same mantra just like the summer of love 2020 mostly peaceful [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  mostly peaceful mostly peaceful. Do we have a count how many how many officers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=269.14s)]
*  were injured in all of this? Oh we've got many that have been had minor [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=273.1s)]
*  injuries that have had serious injuries, shattered bones, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  concussions that have been hurt from different bricks that have been thrown. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=281.7s)]
*  You've seen the various pictures and videos of different vehicles that have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=285.3s)]
*  burned and what they have done to not even just victimize law enforcement [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=290.5s)]
*  officers but people in these communities that were stopped on a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=294.06s)]
*  freeway for hours weren't able to get to their families and were victimized from [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=297.14s)]
*  the objects being thrown. So it's an unfortunate situation but it's one that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  President Trump is going to shut down because he remembers 2020. I remember [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=306.26s)]
*  2020. I remember where all this started back in 2020 which was in Minnesota with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=310.02s)]
*  Tim Walz as their governor who let his city burn for days and then he called up [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=314.7s)]
*  neighboring governors like me and said would you please deploy your National [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=319.26s)]
*  Guard to help me and bail me out because I let this go too far and we didn't. We [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=323.06s)]
*  said listen you had poor leadership and you won't put your own National Guard [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=327.88s)]
*  out there on the front line. Why should we bail you out of a situation to where [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=331.8s)]
*  you allowed your entire city to burn to the ground and the president, President [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=335.26s)]
*  Trump had to step in. He's doing that again and he's being very proactive and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm proud to be on the front lines with him to bring peace to this city and not [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=344.06s)]
*  let it get out of hand like it did in 2020. Last question, what about the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=347.38s)]
*  pallets of bricks mysteriously appearing at the scene of where some of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=351.76s)]
*  this took place? Have you found evidence of organization and funding? Absolutely [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  Sean these these are organized. These are people that are being paid to do [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=361.9s)]
*  this. You can follow how they behave, the signals they give to each other in these [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=365.58s)]
*  crowds and these protests to instigate violence. This is an operation and it's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  professionally done. They've done it before and we're gonna stop it and make [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymYIXrH9pjg&t=374.53999999999996s)]
