# Sean Hannity: If you break our laws, you go home
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8)
*  Thanks to a 9-0 decision from the US Supreme Court, an MS-13 gang member, citizen, not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=0.0s)]
*  of the United States, but El Salvador, will not be coming back to this country. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=7.44s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=12.5s)]
*  You break our laws, you don't respect our borders and sovereignty, that's breakingâ€”that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=13.5s)]
*  means you go home to the utter dismay of fake news, CNN. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=17.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=23.14s)]
*  Do you plan to ask President McKaylee to help return the man who your administration [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=24.14s)]
*  says was mistakenly deported? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=28.58s)]
*  The man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=30.58s)]
*  Well let me ask Pam, would you ask to answer that question? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=33.02s)]
*  Sure, President. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=36.22s)]
*  First and foremost, he was illegally in our country, he had been illegally in our country, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=37.22s)]
*  and in 2019, two courts, an immigration court and an appellate immigration court, ruled [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=43.3s)]
*  that he was a member of MS-13 and he was illegally in our country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=49.74s)]
*  Would you answer that question also, please? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=55.56s)]
*  Gladly. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=57.78s)]
*  So as Pam mentioned, there's an illegal alien from El Salvador. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=58.78s)]
*  So with respect to you, he's a citizen of El Salvador. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=63.58s)]
*  So it's very arrogant even for American media to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=68.1s)]
*  how to handle their own citizens as a starting point. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=73.58s)]
*  As two immigration courts found that he was a member of MS-13, when President Trump declared [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=76.86s)]
*  to be a foreign terrorist organization, that meant that he was no longer eligible under [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=82.5s)]
*  federal law, which I'm sure you know, you're very familiar with the INA, that he was no [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=87.78s)]
*  longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in the United States. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  So he had a deportation order that was valid. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  Can President McKaylee weigh in on this? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=98.78s)]
*  Do you plan to return him? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  Well I guess, I'm supposed to have suggested that I smuggle a terrorist into the United [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  States, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  They totally see that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  How can I smuggle, how can I return him to the United States? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  It's like I smuggle him into the United States, or whatever it is, of course I'm not going [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=111.1s)]
*  to do it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  It's like, I mean the question is for Buster's. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  Law and order, safety, security, respect our laws, border sovereignty, come in, but come [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=120.5s)]
*  in legally. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=125.22s)]
*  Now tonight we can report that 11 more violent illegal immigrants, including seven Trendea [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=126.22s)]
*  Aragwa gang members, were deported to El Salvador and their notorious prison system over the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=131.38s)]
*  weekend. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=137.18s)]
*  And Trump has a duty to protect all of you and our way of life. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=138.26s)]
*  What happened under Biden at the border is unforgivable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=142.78s)]
*  We will pay the price for his open border policies for decades likely to come. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=146.1s)]
*  And by the way, today the illegal immigrant who killed a Maryland mother of five, we've [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  spoken of her often, Rachel Moran, thankfully convicted of murder, but we should never forget [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=155.98s)]
*  suffering caused by what was the most preventable national security crisis that Joe and Kamala [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=162.82s)]
*  created at our border. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=169.34s)]
*  Now thankfully as promised, President Trump has secured our borders, is now deporting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=171.34s)]
*  as many criminal illegals as possible. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=175.34s)]
*  By the way, if you didn't come here legally, you are a criminal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=178.34s)]
*  And all it took was leadership. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=182.26s)]
*  We're seeing the same thing now when it comes to trade. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=183.9s)]
*  There are now more than a hundred countries that are begging to negotiate with the Trump [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=186.4s)]
*  White House. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=190.98s)]
*  Fifteen hard deals are on the table. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=191.98s)]
*  But if you're watching the state run legacy media mob this morning, you might have seen [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=194.94s)]
*  Janet Yellen once famously promise that person that inflation was transitory. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, she referred to Donald Trump's economic vision as a pipe dream. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=208.7s)]
*  I don't understand the rationale for the tariffs. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=209.7s)]
*  Perhaps it's to bring back American manufacturing, but I really think that's a pipe dream and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=214.26s)]
*  not something that is likely to be accomplished. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=222.5s)]
*  And we could even raise questions about whether or not in a broad-based way that's a desirable [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=226.58s)]
*  goal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=232.58s)]
*  The rationale, how about stop ripping off America, stop abusing America, especially [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=234.34s)]
*  our allied countries, most of whom depend on the U.S. for their national security. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=239.7s)]
*  Other big news today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  Tech giant, Nvidia, announced a $500 billion investment right here in the USA, entirely [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  manufacturing their supercomputers, AI infrastructure inside this country for the very first time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=254.0s)]
*  But according to ABC's John Karl, another elitist in the media, this type of investment [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  is not actually a good thing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=266.5s)]
*  Apparently he's worried that we will become, quote, a nation of cobblers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=268.34s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=274.5s)]
*  The president also said there's going to be a transition cost, transition problems. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=275.82s)]
*  I mean, we are going to see higher prices in America's role. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=279.38s)]
*  It's like you can open a factory tomorrow to build iPhones or to make sneakers, shoes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, we buy a lot of shoes in this country. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=290.46s)]
*  99 percent of them are made elsewhere. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=293.9s)]
*  I mean, are we going to become a nation of cobblers again? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=298.22s)]
*  This is going to mean higher prices, isn't it? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=302.66s)]
*  I mean, have you seen, I don't necessarily think so. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=305.3s)]
*  I think the idea is that we can manufacture here in America. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=309.66s)]
*  All right, as a former blue collar worker for decades in my life, I kind of take it [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=315.02s)]
*  as a compliment, but this isn't just about good American jobs. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=320.06s)]
*  It's also a matter of national security. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=324.38s)]
*  You know, relying on China for pharmaceuticals or other countries for semiconductor chips, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=326.7s)]
*  that's a dangerous game. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=333.26s)]
*  And right on cue, China just suspended exports of rare earth minerals to the U.S. in a blatant [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  attempt to kneecap weapons and tech manufacturing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=340.53999999999996s)]
*  So Donald Trump is absolutely right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=344.14s)]
*  This reliance on China and other countries will come to an end once and for all. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  They can have free and fair trade if they choose or reciprocal tariffs. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=352.34s)]
*  That's their choice. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=356.17999999999995s)]
*  The president will almost never get any positive coverage from the legacy media mob. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=357.26s)]
*  The good news is almost no one in the U.S. trusts or respects these people anyway. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=361.97999999999996s)]
*  So what's the point? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  It doesn't really matter what they say or what they write anyplace, anywhere. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=369.05999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, these far left Democrats pretending to be newsmen are screaming into the void [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=374.7s)]
*  here with reaction. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  The first of making money on the Fox Business Network, Charles Payne is here. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  Charles, you know, let's take an example. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=384.1s)]
*  European Union, do they not rely on the U.S. and NATO? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=387.62s)]
*  Don't they rely on the U.S. for a lot of their national security needs? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=391.7s)]
*  And aren't they supposed to be our allies? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=396.22s)]
*  And if they are, can you explain why the EU sells nearly $50 billion worth of automobiles [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=398.1s)]
*  in the U.S. every year while we sell a little over $8 billion? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=404.26s)]
*  That would be unfair. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=408.86s)]
*  Is it because of the 10% tariff to our 2.5% tariff or the 20% VAT tax, which adds 30% [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=409.86s)]
*  to the sticker price, which makes that car from the U.S. cost prohibitive? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=417.9s)]
*  Maybe that's not the way friends should treat each other. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=422.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's all at the above. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=426.5s)]
*  And I guess it's like the dysfunctional relationship maybe someone has with a neighbor that's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=428.58s)]
*  borrowed their lawnmower, that's borrowed this, that's borrowed that, that's borrowed [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=433.38s)]
*  money and never mentions it, never bothers to give it back. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, you take things for granted and you go back to after World War II, we rebuilt [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=440.1s)]
*  Europe, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=445.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, and since then, we've kind of taken this on. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=446.02000000000004s)]
*  You go back to the general account, you know, to the first tariff agreement, the global [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  tariff agreement, the world was in tatters. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=452.86s)]
*  We, as a nation, helped to rebuild the entire world, starting with Europe. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=454.94s)]
*  And we just lost track of everything. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=459.74s)]
*  We just sort of were sitting on this perch. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=461.66s)]
*  We said, well, let China into the World Trade Organization 2001. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=463.94s)]
*  Look at any significant data since then with respect to U.S. manufacturing, manufacturing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t3lfimyGz8&t=467.94s)]
