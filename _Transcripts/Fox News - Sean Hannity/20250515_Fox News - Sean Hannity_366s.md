# US-Qatar relationship now on 'another level'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10)
*  Joining us now, State Department spokesperson, our former friend and colleague. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=0.0s)]
*  Not our former friend, still friend, former colleague, Tammy Bruce. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=4.34s)]
*  Tammy, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=8.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Let's just get your — well, no, we have not given up our friendship. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=14.84s)]
*  I stand corrected. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=15.84s)]
*  Let's get right to how profound and deep this is, because seriously, this is a region [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=16.84s)]
*  that has been incapable of getting over the finish line and achieving peace. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=25.18s)]
*  There seems to be an opportunity here, and we'll get into the Iran question in a second. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=32.7s)]
*  Overall, how do you see this trip, and what are the impacts that you see for the United [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=37.38s)]
*  States and the region and the world? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  It's been a remarkable gift to be here, to be traveling here with Secretary of State [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=43.94s)]
*  Marco Rubio. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  But in support of Donald Trump, it is an astounding experience. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=50.58s)]
*  And Americans can see it, of course, in the coverage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=55.06s)]
*  But I have to tell you that we see this — and I see it, as we all have — as the unfolding [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=58.3s)]
*  of what he promised and the nature of the power of not just a personality, but a man [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=62.9s)]
*  who has proven to the world that he does what he says he's going to do, that he's got the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=68.34s)]
*  skill to be able to bring it about, and he brings the respect that is required for other [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=72.44s)]
*  nations to take us seriously and to negotiate seriously and for our enemies to understand [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=78.44000000000001s)]
*  that they have no choice but to back off, to do as we request of them, so that they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=85.04s)]
*  too can have a better future. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  And we see this in the way that he's been treated. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=93.56s)]
*  And as you've noted, here in the Middle East, my goodness, millions of lives destroyed because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=95.84s)]
*  of a few bad actors, if you will, groups that pop up, the citizens of these nations being [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=100.68s)]
*  harmed because of a dynamic of a world that feels as though it can do nothing and allows [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=108.0s)]
*  this to become the status quo. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  It takes Donald Trump to say enough is enough and to demand new ideas so that every nation, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=116.92s)]
*  not just in this region, but around the world, can recognize that things can be better, that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=123.0s)]
*  life can be better, and that he can show them the way. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=128.56s)]
*  In this case, it's about business dealings. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=132.56s)]
*  It's about becoming partners with nations in this region, making sure that people certainly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=135.92s)]
*  that Americans benefit, but that when Americans benefit, and America is great again, the rest [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=142.04s)]
*  of the world has a path to follow. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=148.14s)]
*  That's Donald Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=150.76s)]
*  I've seen it in every stop, and it is also manifested through the work and the understanding [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=151.6s)]
*  of that vision by Marco Rubio and our foreign policy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=157.1s)]
*  It's an exciting time. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  Our generation will see the benefits of this, and we're really blessed to have Donald Trump [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=162.38s)]
*  leading the nature of what the future is going to look like for us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=168.02s)]
*  You know, a big part of the equation is that all of these countries have to not only reject [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=171.34s)]
*  radicalism, but they can't turn a blind eye towards radicalism, and I think there is more [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  than valid criticism that, in fact, they have. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=184.86s)]
*  The president challenging Saudi Arabia, challenging the new leader of Syria, to not only reject [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  it and not turn a blind eye to it, but to now embrace the Abraham Accords and the recognition [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=194.86s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  I actually think that these countries would like to do it, but I also think there is a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=203.5s)]
*  fear of doing it because of what the Iranian reaction would be. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=207.74s)]
*  They would become pariahs, and they might find themselves battling Iran, and I don't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=212.42s)]
*  think any nation in this region wants that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=219.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, nobody wants war, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=221.94s)]
*  The president doesn't. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=224.89999999999998s)]
*  That's why he's working through diplomacy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=226.14s)]
*  He believes that he can make the difference here, and he knows even, of course, Iran now [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  is on its heels as Israel defends itself, as it definitely is dealing with murder groups [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=232.7s)]
*  like Hamas and Hezbollah and the Houthis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=239.06s)]
*  They also have the United States, as we support them as an ally, and in the midst of that, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  the largest state sponsor of terror, Iran, suddenly is on its heels, and of course, we [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=248.26000000000002s)]
*  engage with them as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=253.34s)]
*  And President Trump really is the best friend you could ever have, but he is also the worst [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  enemy you can have. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=260.54s)]
*  He wants peace in this world. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=262.1s)]
*  He knows where the problems sit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=264.36s)]
*  He is determined to change it. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=266.66s)]
*  He knows it has to happen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=268.36s)]
*  That will be his legacy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=269.68s)]
*  But like with Syria, you know, one of the things he's demanding of them is to join [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=271.18s)]
*  the Abraham Accords, something he established in his first term. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=274.62s)]
*  So even then, he was creating the building blocks that allow his demands and his expectations [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  and his visions to be seen and to be implemented now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=284.3s)]
*  And of course, nations everywhere, if they realize, and as they do with President Trump, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=288.32s)]
*  that you've got a good friend, he knows what he's doing economically and also militarily, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=293.38s)]
*  but he also inspires. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=298.14s)]
*  He inspires and he leads and he teaches. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=300.28s)]
*  And that is what the rest of the world also wants. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=303.64s)]
*  They do want to know, as you've noted, that they're not going to be abandoned, that this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  is long-term change, that it is America and the American people that he represents. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  Through that election last year, we've also said enough is enough, and he is our North [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  Star in implementing that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=321.9s)]
*  This is a new American revolution manifested through that vision. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=323.82s)]
*  The reason I believe that President Trump can be so comfortable and free to be able [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=328.98s)]
*  to do his work is because he knows we have his back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=333.84s)]
*  And that is now what is moving through the rest of the world here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=338.12s)]
*  It's an exciting time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=341.64s)]
*  He has demands of people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=342.96s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=344.32s)]
*  But it makes a difference when it comes to what they feel they can do with their own [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=345.36s)]
*  countries. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=348.28s)]
*  All right, Tammy Bruce, we appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=349.28s)]
*  As always, always a friend. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIn9dcVT10&t=352.4s)]
