# Trump is saving the middle class, GOP lawmaker says
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [March 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier today, President Trump held what he called an extremely productive call with new [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=4.4s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, adding that the two agree on many things. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=10.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, despite the left's phony hysteria and endless claims that Trump will give tax [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=15.56s)]
*  breaks to the wealthy, Axios is reporting just the opposite. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=21.44s)]
*  According to their sources, the president is considering allowing taxes on the wealthy [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=26.12s)]
*  to increase to cover tax breaks on tips. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=31.16s)]
*  And speaking from the White House earlier today, President Trump floated the idea of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=35.8s)]
*  letting people deduct interest payments for cars made in America. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=39.38s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=44.72s)]
*  If you buy a car in the United States that's made in the United States, if it's manufactured [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=45.72s)]
*  here, when you borrow money, if you borrow money, you have interest payments, we're [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=51.56s)]
*  going to let you deduct the interest payment for income tax reasons. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=55.48s)]
*  And I think that's going to more than pay for itself. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=59.08s)]
*  According to auto workers who backed Trump during the campaign, he is delivering on his [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  promise to bring manufacturing dominance back to the United States. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=68.8s)]
*  And while the left continues to meltdown over Trump's proposed tariffs, they don't realize [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=73.24s)]
*  this is how he negotiates. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=78.14s)]
*  Here's what he said aboard Air Force One earlier today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=79.92s)]
*  On the car tariffs and just the reciprocal tariffs, a lot of countries are making gestures, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  including Britain, which is talked about reducing its digital services. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=89.96s)]
*  They want to make deals. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=92.96s)]
*  They want to make deals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=93.96s)]
*  They do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=94.96s)]
*  Are you in a mode or, you know, whichâ€” [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=95.96s)]
*  Well, it's possible if we could get something for the deal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=97.96s)]
*  But, you know, we've been taking advantage of for 40 years, maybe more, and it's just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=100.16s)]
*  not going to happen anymore. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=106.64s)]
*  But yeah, I'm certainly open to that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=107.64s)]
*  Speaking on the Trump tariffs, Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno said any short-term pay will [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=110.96s)]
*  be worth it in the long run for the auto industry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  Remember, Senator Moreno used to own a very successful car dealership business. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=119.44s)]
*  And he joins us right now. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=125.72s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for joining us on Hannity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=127.16s)]
*  Explain more where you're at on these tariffs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=130.16s)]
*  What's this going to mean to the auto industry and for our nation? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=133.4s)]
*  Well, first, let me just tell you that on Monday, we are introducing legislation to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=137.12s)]
*  do what President Trump said, which is to make interest on autos purchased that are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=141.6s)]
*  made in America deductible. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=146.8s)]
*  So we're going to do that on Monday. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=147.8s)]
*  What President Trump is doing is he's saving auto workers and steel workers and the middle [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=150.16s)]
*  class in this country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=155.92s)]
*  Look, for 40, 50 years, our industrial sector got gutted because of terrible trade deals. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=157.24s)]
*  It's very simple, Jason. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=163.76s)]
*  If you sell a car in America, you're going to make it in America. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=165.36s)]
*  And the reality is the tariffs will hit primarily very expensive automobiles. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=168.96s)]
*  And in effect, that's a tax on the wealthy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  You would think the Democrats would be in support of that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=176.52s)]
*  But when it comes to the cars that middle class Americans buy, those cars will be made [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  right here in America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=184.28000000000003s)]
*  And the cost is going to go down because we're going to get rid of all these electric vehicle [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=185.28000000000003s)]
*  mandates. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  Now, one of the things that President Trump is at least hinting at, at least it's being [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=190.52s)]
*  reported at, is that he's okay increasing taxes on the wealthy to cover the cost of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=196.12s)]
*  not taxing tips. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  Where are you at on that? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=204.2s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=205.2s)]
*  Look, we are the party of the working class. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=206.84s)]
*  Now, it's taken a while for us to get here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=209.84s)]
*  The Democrats are the party of the elites, the party of the crazies, the party of Hollywood [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=212.88s)]
*  university professors. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=216.92s)]
*  We're the party of the autoworkers, steelworkers, the people who built this country, the people [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  who deserve to live a good life where a mom or a dad can have one full-time job, buy a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  home, buy a car, afford to go on vacation periodically, and retire with dignity. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  That's what our party stands for. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=235.24s)]
*  That's what we stand behind. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  And look, with the money we're going to collect with tariffs, Jason, we're going to be able [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=238.88s)]
*  to restore Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security for generations to come for those very workers [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=242.76s)]
*  that pay into the system. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=248.88s)]
*  Yeah, if you combine that with the more efficiency with what Doge is trying to do in duplicate [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=250.88s)]
*  payments and all the other horror stories we hear about, that's how you put those things [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=257.24s)]
*  on financial footing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=261.86s)]
*  That's how you get them back and moving in the same direction. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=263.44s)]
*  But Senator, can the Congress handle that? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=266.2s)]
*  Can Congress actually keep up with the president by passing the legislation needed? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=269.36s)]
*  And can you do one big, beautiful bill in reconciliation? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=273.72s)]
*  We've, look, we've stuck together thus far. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=277.92s)]
*  Senator Thune is doing an amazing job. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  Senator Barrasso is doing a great job. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=285.16s)]
*  We have all new leadership in the United States Senate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=286.8s)]
*  We've stuck together on confirmations. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=290.32s)]
*  We've gotten the Congressional Review Acts done. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=292.32s)]
*  We're working hard every single day. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=294.72s)]
*  And I'm confident that we're going to get a bill that protects Medicare, Medicaid and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=296.32s)]
*  Social Security, puts in place policies that help working Americans and absolutely show [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=301.2s)]
*  the country that the Democrats have no ideas, no leadership and no uniting principles other [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=306.94s)]
*  than they're held hostage by the extremists in their party. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=312.98s)]
*  And I think Mike Johnson, the Speaker of Johnson is also doing a great job, and he's going [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=317.12s)]
*  to get his conference across the finish line. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=320.8s)]
*  We're going to get the work done. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=323.18s)]
*  Yeah, it is true about the Democrats, because all you hear is, oh, we're going to be the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=325.88s)]
*  resistance. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=329.72s)]
*  And then you hear no alternatives of any viability on what they suggest should be done. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=331.08s)]
*  Last question, Senator. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=338.04s)]
*  Donald Trump is giving master classes on actually how to negotiate. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=339.4s)]
*  I guess what a lot of people don't appreciate, particularly with tariffs and working with [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=345.04s)]
*  these foreign nations, is that he is negotiating. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=349.04s)]
*  It's his tool. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=353.52s)]
*  But he tells us and foreshadows what he wants as a consequence, and that is parity. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  He wants to make sure that there's not these massive trade deficits. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=360.12s)]
*  Well, I agree with that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=363.44s)]
*  I think he's looking for fair and reciprocal trade. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=365.96s)]
*  But when it comes to steel, when it comes to the auto industry, when it comes to energy, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  semiconductor chips, soon pharmaceuticals, I think it's not negotiation. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=372.68s)]
*  I think this is the rules of the road. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=377.12s)]
*  You must make your car in America or you're going to be tariffed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=379.68s)]
*  We want that industrial capacity back. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=384.04s)]
*  We have to rebuild our industrial heartland. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=386.44s)]
*  And I think President Trump's going to do that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=388.92s)]
*  He's going to do it in short order. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  It's an imperative. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  He campaigned on it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  I campaigned on it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=394.52000000000004s)]
*  And we're going to get it done. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it is amazing the speed and velocity of where Donald Trump is taking us. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  And I'm glad to hear you talk about. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=402.44s)]
*  Can't wait to get the details of where we're going with pharmaceuticals, because that'll [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  impact a lot of people. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=408.92s)]
*  Senator Moreno, thank you so much for joining us on HANNIT. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Cm1HOr3qg&t=411.28000000000003s)]
