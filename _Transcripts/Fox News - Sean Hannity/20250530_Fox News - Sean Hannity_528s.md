# 'TONE-DEAF': Stephen A Smith grills Democratic Party
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM)
*  Now, the cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline is quickly becoming the biggest White House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=0.0s)]
*  scandal of our lifetime. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=4.88s)]
*  Again, who knew what? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  What did they know? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=8.52s)]
*  When did they know it? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=9.52s)]
*  And who was really in charge? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=10.72s)]
*  You all deserve answers. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Our good friend Stephen A. Smith grilling Jake Tapper over his new book after Tapper [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=13.84s)]
*  was himself complicit in the cover-up for years. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=18.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=22.48s)]
*  You're talking people on the left, in all likelihood, who feel betrayed by the book [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=23.48s)]
*  because, oh my lord, it's calling out the Biden administration and what was transpiring [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=28.92s)]
*  at that time. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=32.96s)]
*  They say this book is a money grab. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=34.08s)]
*  What do you say to people on either side of the aisle who make those accusations about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  you at this particular moment in time? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=40.88s)]
*  No, our only agenda was to find out what happened. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=43.88s)]
*  Our only agenda was to write this book. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=47.52s)]
*  In terms of the left, it's a money grab. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  That's not the case. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=54.92s)]
*  It's not. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=56.64s)]
*  This is... [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=57.64s)]
*  I don't want to get into where my money comes from, but you know, CNN is my main job and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=58.64s)]
*  that's where my main source of income by far. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=64.24s)]
*  Very few people write books to make money. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=67.84s)]
*  You write a book because you want to say something. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=70.7s)]
*  You want to have a legacy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=72.78s)]
*  And what's even more alarming, according to Tapper, not a single one of his sources for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=76.12s)]
*  the book expressed any regret or remorse over their role in the scandal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=80.28s)]
*  Anyway, here now with reaction, he is the host of the Stephen A. Smith show. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=85.2s)]
*  Stephen A., I hate to do this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=89.76s)]
*  I've got to compliment you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=92.4s)]
*  I hate to... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=94.68s)]
*  I really do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=95.68s)]
*  I hate to start an interview in a nice way, but you did a great job and you're honest [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=96.68s)]
*  and you're asking the right questions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=102.4s)]
*  Here's the problem with Jake. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=104.44s)]
*  We started reporting on this show in 2019, Joe's Cognitive Decline. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=106.16s)]
*  You watched my show. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=113.16s)]
*  We played tape after tape after tape after tape after tape. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=114.48s)]
*  Anybody with eyes to see knew. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=118.64s)]
*  He didn't cover it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  He excoriated Laura Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  His network didn't cover it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=123.48s)]
*  And now he's making money off the deal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Reaction? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=127.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, he apologized for it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=128.28s)]
*  He said he called Laura Trump to apologize, which obviously she deserved. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=131.0s)]
*  Okay, that's fine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=134.88s)]
*  And I'm not here to defend Jake Tapper. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=136.66s)]
*  I don't know him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=138.2s)]
*  I've met him a couple of times. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=139.2s)]
*  I've been interviewed about him a couple of times. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=140.2s)]
*  I interviewed him yesterday on my show and that's as far as our relationship goes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=142.08s)]
*  But you guys who are aficionados in the political stratosphere are more apt to question and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=146.72s)]
*  to judge accordingly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  And I'm not here to refute that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=153.84s)]
*  What I would say to you, however, is that I don't cover politics. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=155.84s)]
*  I was covering sports in two years before the election, almost two years before the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  election. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  I was pointing the finger at Joe Biden and what I saw. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  To me, if you had two eyes and you could see, you saw what the hell was going on here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  You saw debilitation kicking in. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=171.54s)]
*  You saw, you know, not incapacitated, but pretty damn close. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=173.38s)]
*  He just didn't seem like himself. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=177.82s)]
*  And you knew something was fishy was going on. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=179.54s)]
*  And I think that right now, as everybody looks to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson and their [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=181.34s)]
*  book Original Sin, I think the biggest thing to peel from that are the culprits within [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=185.94s)]
*  the Democratic Party who knew about the cognitive decline far more up close than you, myself, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=191.26s)]
*  or many, many other American citizens knew. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=199.1s)]
*  And they were not only complicit, but were willing to circumvent the Constitution of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=201.73999999999998s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=205.62s)]
*  They were willing to shove aside the wishes of American voters. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  They understood what the system entails. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=209.98s)]
*  They wanted to bypass a primary. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=211.94s)]
*  They wanted to bypass elements of the democratic process in order to ensure that their guy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=214.26s)]
*  was in office instead of Donald Trump. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=219.78s)]
*  And to me, when you've walked around as a party labeling Donald Trump an existential [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=222.1s)]
*  threat for years, for years, and then a book comes out detailing how several people within [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=227.66s)]
*  the administration and within the Democratic Party may have been guilty of this instead [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=236.06s)]
*  of Trump, I find that to be incredibly alarming. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=241.14s)]
*  And it's something usually I'm getting on you for how dogged you are and relentless [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=245.66s)]
*  and persistent you are with your takes on the Democratic Party, Sean. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=250.62s)]
*  But you will not get a dissenting word from me. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=254.8s)]
*  I think hell needs to rain down upon anybody that was involved in anything. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  You can say it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=263.06s)]
*  You can say Sean Hannity was right and they were wrong. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=264.14000000000004s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=268.14000000000004s)]
*  First of all, welcome back to the States. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=269.94s)]
*  I know you're overseas. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=270.94s)]
*  You're sitting there chilling and having a good time for a little while. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=271.94s)]
*  But now that you're back talking to me, let's be very, very clear. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=274.86s)]
*  I gave you time to talk to whine and bitch and moan if I don't give you time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=276.98s)]
*  Watch your language. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=281.58000000000004s)]
*  You don't need to use that language over the national airways or broadcast television. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=282.58000000000004s)]
*  Watch your mouth. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=285.1s)]
*  Yeah, I actually do. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=286.1s)]
*  But let me ask you this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  What exactly is it that you were right about? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=288.14000000000004s)]
*  Tell me what you want me to say that you were right about. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=289.74s)]
*  And I'll tell you if you're right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=291.38s)]
*  I was right about Joe Biden's cognitive decline. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=292.38s)]
*  I was also right about it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=294.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=295.38s)]
*  Go back and look at Fake Jake and his coverage of the Russia hoax with the dirty Russian [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=296.38s)]
*  disinformation dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for that was totally debunked. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=300.62s)]
*  Watch his coverage. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=305.38s)]
*  Go back and watch it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=306.38s)]
*  Watch his coverage or lack thereof of FISA abuse that used the bulk of information to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=307.38s)]
*  lie to FISA judges. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=312.38s)]
*  They used that dirty dossier. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=314.3s)]
*  Look at the double standard of coverage when it comes to top secret classified information. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=316.38s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago gets raided. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=322.14s)]
*  Four locations of Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, bleach pit and hammers and SIM cards removed. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=323.97999999999996s)]
*  Look at the double standard, the ridiculous valuation of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=331.17999999999995s)]
*  Look at the Letitia James-Alvin Bragg connection. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=334.94s)]
*  Let's run on a policy of we're going to get Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=338.46s)]
*  And nobody said a word on these networks. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  They're going to write books and make money on that next? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=344.42s)]
*  Because they all lie. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=346.94s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=347.94s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=348.94s)]
*  Number one, nobody's in a position to refute a single word you just uttered. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=349.94s)]
*  I certainly am not. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=354.06s)]
*  Not just because I don't know the intimate details of everything, but you do and many, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=355.34s)]
*  many others who cover this for a living have. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=358.3s)]
*  And they detailed, folks on the right detailed it just the same way you did. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=360.74s)]
*  Just not as relentlessly as not as consistently. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=364.3s)]
*  And they weren't first the way that you were on many of those occasions. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=366.1s)]
*  So kudos to you when you bring that stuff up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=369.18s)]
*  They were wrong, Joe, the opposite. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=371.18s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=372.18s)]
*  I'm talking about the people on the right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=373.18s)]
*  I said, secondly, no need to call him fake, Jake. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=374.98s)]
*  Just sit up there and say you're Sean Hannity and you're number one and they're not. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=377.06s)]
*  It's just that simple. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=379.82s)]
*  No need to engage in a call. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=380.82s)]
*  And don't do that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=381.82s)]
*  Number number to stop that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=382.82s)]
*  That's number three. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=383.82s)]
*  Number three. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=385.66s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=386.66s)]
*  Unfortunately, Sean, and listen, you have to confess to this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=387.66s)]
*  If you are a conservative, you're going to lean towards favoring them and not favoring [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=392.26s)]
*  the left and the left is going to lean towards favoring the left as opposed to the right. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=397.26s)]
*  I have a history of calling out Republicans that I can give you a laundry list of that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=401.22s)]
*  And I'm going to give you another example. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=405.38s)]
*  I was right about Richard Jewell. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=406.98s)]
*  I was right about Duke Lacrosse. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=408.54s)]
*  I was right about UVA. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=410.14000000000004s)]
*  I was right about Ferguson, Missouri. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=411.34000000000003s)]
*  I was right about Freddie Gray and Baltimore. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=412.86s)]
*  And they all rushed the judgment. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=415.66s)]
*  We have a problem. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=418.70000000000005s)]
*  Although the problem's going away because nobody believed them in the election. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=419.98s)]
*  Well, listen, here's the problem now. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  You just finished talking about, by the way, you had a great guest on. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=427.12s)]
*  And I love that last line the young lady put out when she talked about the Democratic Party [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=430.3s)]
*  and how they're supposed to be looking out for the people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=434.7s)]
*  They're looking out for themselves. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=436.5s)]
*  I forgot the exact quote that she gave, but it was very poignant. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=437.5s)]
*  I will say this to you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=440.02000000000004s)]
*  When you look at the state of affairs right now, I'm looking at Newsweek just a few days [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=441.94s)]
*  ago. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump is gaining traction within the Democratic Party. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  Black voters, young voters, he did it during the election, but it seems to be the trajectory [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=449.46000000000004s)]
*  seems to be going in a forward direction. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=453.12s)]
*  You pointed to the mayor of Chicago and his stance and how counterproductive that appears [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=455.24s)]
*  to be. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=460.02s)]
*  You showed Jasmine Crockett. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=461.02s)]
*  They haven't realized yet that if it's AOC or it's Jasmine Crockett, there's a reason [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=462.14s)]
*  Sean Hannity shows them every chance he gets. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  He wants them to be illuminated. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=468.58s)]
*  He wants them to be front and center for the Democratic Party because it will ensure that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=470.24s)]
*  the Republicans are going to win this one. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=473.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm saying it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm not hiding it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=475.65999999999997s)]

*  I'm simply saying it shows you how tone deaf they are because their focus seems to be [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  anything being the antithesis of Trump instead of helping to govern the country. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=488.58s)]
*  When the book comes out and that stuff is revealed, it makes it even worse. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=494.9s)]
*  Makes it even worse. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_4LpTJgzyM&t=498.74s)]
