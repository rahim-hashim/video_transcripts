# Harvard's feud could start this trend, predicts GOP gubernatorial candidate
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. The feud between Harvard and the Trump administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=0.0s)]
*  it's continuing. Harvard president Alan Gerber said the school will not compromise on its [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=8.4s)]
*  rights during an interview with Lester Holt that aired last night. Have a look. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=14.18s)]
*  You're taking on the most powerful man in the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=19.48s)]
*  We are defending what I believe is one of the most important linchpins of the American [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=23.32s)]
*  economy and way of life, our universities. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=29.76s)]
*  How much pain can Harvard absorb here? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=33.04s)]
*  We don't know how much we can actually absorb, but what we do know is that we cannot compromise [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=36.68s)]
*  on basic principles. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=43.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, according to a new report, Harvard's endowment, get this, it equates to roughly [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=46.6s)]
*  $7 million per student. Still, the school received over half a billion dollars in federal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  funding and that happens annually. But president Trump's war with Harvard received praise [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  from the Anti-Defamation League, the CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, saying, quote, it's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=66.88s)]
*  a good thing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=73.0s)]
*  Here with reaction, Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Vivek, thank you so much [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=74.96s)]
*  for joining us. I think what people really appreciate about you and your approach is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=81.08s)]
*  it's very principled. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=84.91999999999999s)]
*  When you hear the Harvard president talk about we can't compromise because these are the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=86.96s)]
*  things we stand for, there's a huge disconnect when I see that because it begs the question, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=92.52s)]
*  what is it that you really stand for? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  Look, I speak as somebody who graduated from Harvard back in 2007. The university always [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=101.12s)]
*  leaned left. It leaned left when I was there. But back then, it was an institution that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  at least cared about free speech and open debate, the pursuit of truth. Veritas is the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  school's slogan. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=116.84s)]
*  And so now I think their embrace of free speech is really selective based on which cause they're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  espousing. My own view is that they need to get out of the business and so many of these [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  universities need to get out of the business of indoctrinating and go back to that pursuit [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=127.24s)]
*  of truth. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=131.6s)]
*  And I predict this could be the beginning of a trend that we see in our country of private [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=132.92s)]
*  universities decoupling themselves from federal funding. Frankly, a lot of these universities [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  have had a lot of mandates rammed down their throat by the Obama administration, by the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=142.92s)]
*  Biden administration in the era of Title IX. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  And so the fact of the matter is this issue of the federal government telling universities [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=150.2s)]
*  what to do or not to do is not some new issue. It's an issue that goes back as old as the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=154.46s)]
*  mid 20th century, if not before, when our federal government was overspending its money [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  anyway. We're in the middle of a national debt crisis. We need to cut down how much [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  our federal government is spending. We need to return as much of that to the states and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=167.18s)]
*  to the people anyway. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=170.78s)]
*  So putting aside the spat of the day, this could be the beginning of a broader trend. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=172.28s)]
*  To say that institutions like Harvard have plenty of successful graduates who are able [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=176.52s)]
*  to fund the mission of the university if they find it aligned with their view of the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=180.3s)]
*  world, decouple yourself from the federal government. Hillsdale's done it, a visit there [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=183.74s)]
*  from time to time. I think other universities may choose and be wise to follow that trend [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=188.22s)]
*  in the future as well. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  Well what is the proper role of government? You know, we see billions and billions. I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=196.38000000000002s)]
*  think most people are shocked at how many billions of dollars are going to these universities. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=200.62s)]
*  So what's the proper role of government when it's a public institution versus maybe a private [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  institution? Where are those lines? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=210.02s)]
*  Well I believe the role of government needs to go back to its skeletal roots as our founding [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=214.9s)]
*  fathers envisioned it. Protect private property rights, provide for national defense and security, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  and on occasion for the right kinds of projects provide infrastructure that's a collective [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=225.02s)]
*  action failure for the private sector. That's it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=229.38s)]
*  The fact of the matter is our government is failing to do those three things over the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  Certainly while Biden was in office and really much of the post-Great Society federal government [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=236.86s)]
*  itself and while it's failing to do the few things that it should do well, secure a border, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  actually provide for the national defense, actually protect private property rights, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=246.18s)]
*  it instead finds all kinds of other things to do in the first place. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  So Jason, this is a deeper conversation we got to have in our country about what is the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  proper role of the federal government. And we've created this entitlement state where [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=257.62s)]
*  Really everybody from the individuals even to institutions to corporations to nonprofits [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=263.08s)]
*  to universities are suckling at the tea to the taxpayer. I think it's time to end that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=267.96s)]
*  culture of dependence. Next year we're celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=272.64s)]
*  Independence. The real Declaration of Independence in the modern day is this. It is independence [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=278.28s)]
*  from the government rather than greater dependence on it. I was in Clyde, Ohio earlier today. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=284.24s)]
*  I had a great conversation with great Ohioans there. I think people are hungry for that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=289.92s)]
*  culture of independence to go back to that founding culture in America. If we do that, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=294.2s)]
*  our country's best days are ahead of us. Our national debt crisis can be behind us. And [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=299.56s)]
*  we actually have a government that allows individuals to flourish in their own private [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  lives instead of trying to socially engineer the way we run our country. That's what I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=307.48s)]
*  think we need to see from our government. Go back to skeletal bare bones roots as our [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=311.88s)]
*  founders envisioned and we're going to be in a much better place as a country if we do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=316.16s)]
*  Yeah, independence brings freedom and freedom brings liberty and liberty is the success that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=321.6s)]
*  allows the people to pursue their happiness as they see it. And I just find it fascinating [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=328.0s)]
*  that these institutions that are taking billions of taxpayer dollars can be so abusive based on [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=334.56s)]
*  somebody's religion and yet they say, oh, but that's just free speech. And I just see the total [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=341.44s)]
*  disconnect. You're one of the better thinkers on this, Vivek. Thank you so much for joining [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rBlaHMMT_k&t=347.12s)]
