# Taylor Lorenz spars with Hannity over her comments about Luigi Mangione
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M)
*  All right, former Washington Post columnist, technology reporter for The New York Times, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=0.0s)]
*  Daily Beast, and business insider Taylor Lorenz made a lot of headlines Sunday with her comments [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=5.72s)]
*  about the alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO assassin, Luigi Mangione. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=11.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=16.12s)]
*  So, you're going to see women especially that feel like, oh my God, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=17.12s)]
*  Like, here's this man who's revolutionary, who's famous, who's handsome, who's young, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=20.88s)]
*  who's smart. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=27.64s)]
*  And he's a person that seems like this morally good man, which is hard to find. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=28.64s)]
*  Okay, she claims she was just expressing the views of his supporters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=35.4s)]
*  But remember, just hours after the murder, she responded to a story about Blue Cross, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=39.72s)]
*  Blue Shield no longer covering anesthesia for some full-length surgeries, writing, quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=44.72s)]
*  and people wonder why we want these executives dead. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=49.96s)]
*  Want them dead. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=54.2s)]
*  She later tried to clarify her comments but appeared to double down, publishing a piece [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=55.42s)]
*  on Substack that said, in part, quote, if you have watched a loved one die because an [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=59.02s)]
*  insurance conglomerate has denied their lifesaving treatment as a cost-cutting measure, yes, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=64.14s)]
*  it's natural to wish that the people who run such conglomerates would suffer the same fate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=69.9s)]
*  Sunday's comments came roughly a week after she expressed disappointment in a post on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=75.06s)]
*  she learned a tweet claiming Joe Biden had not died was not true. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=80.34s)]
*  Remember, back in November, she posted saying, quote, Joe Biden is a war criminal who should [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=85.14s)]
*  never know peace. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=90.18s)]
*  Technology, online culture journalist Taylor Lorenz is here to explain. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=91.66s)]
*  All right, try and explain this to me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=96.86s)]
*  You feel joy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=100.26s)]
*  Those are your words. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=101.42s)]
*  So you felt joy over the murder of this father? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=102.42s)]
*  No, those are the words you use. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=106.86s)]
*  You can shake your head all you want. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=109.06s)]
*  No. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=110.06s)]
*  I mean, you have the tape. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=111.06s)]
*  And we have the tape. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=112.06s)]
*  And number one, then you go on to say, and people wonder why we want these executives [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=113.86s)]
*  dead. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=119.14s)]
*  Then you posted an image of the Blue Cross CEO, Kim Keck. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=120.38s)]
*  Now, let me ask you, what part of this UnitedHealthcare CEO being a father and a husband, don't you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=124.7s)]
*  understand? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  What part of you having a choice of what health care provider you choose to deal with or not [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=134.0s)]
*  do you not understand? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=140.56s)]
*  Because you don't have to go with United. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=141.56s)]
*  You don't have to go a Blue Cross. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=143.4s)]
*  So let me just be extra clear. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  Never did I say that I felt joy in his death. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=150.0s)]
*  I said very explicitly, if you play the full segment, and actually people can watch that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=153.32000000000002s)]
*  segment on my YouTube in full, not the edited version that Piers showed, I said that I felt [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=156.68s)]
*  joy, along with millions of other Americans, that the brutality of our health care system [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=161.56s)]
*  was finally being acknowledged. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=166.2s)]
*  I believe that our current health care system is murderous, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=168.04s)]
*  I mean, we have uninsured Americans with a 40% higher risk of death compared to insured [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=171.08s)]
*  counterparts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=176.32s)]
*  Taylor, we could talk about health care all night, but that's not the topic. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=177.32s)]
*  New to lack of health insurance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=180.56s)]
*  Taylor, that's not the topic. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=182.12s)]
*  You can talk about health care. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=183.84s)]
*  I don't like the health care system either. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=184.96s)]
*  And a lot of people have experienced frustration, like you're saying. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=186.88s)]
*  That, to me, is separate and apart from the debate of praising, calling handsome, smart, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=190.22s)]
*  intelligent, being joyful over the death and assassination of innocent people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  And that's what your comments did. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=201.5s)]
*  Your comments basically put your seal of approval on murder and assassination. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=204.05999999999997s)]
*  And I'm trying to understand whether you like this guy, like the way he does business or [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=210.66s)]
*  You're advocating and putting a smiley face on assassination. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  And I'm trying to understand what is in your soul that doesn't understand he's a father [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=220.7s)]
*  and a husband here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  What are you missing? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=229.34s)]
*  There seems to be a missing chip with you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=230.34s)]
*  Shawna, if you'd like to hear, you know, I will need to talk in order to explain. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=232.42s)]
*  I don't want the rationalization. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=237.34s)]
*  I want you to think about what you said. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=238.94s)]
*  Explain what you said. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=241.62s)]
*  Oh, I know exactly what I said. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=242.62s)]
*  Again, I'm attempting to right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  So I'd ask you to please give the space and try to listen here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  As I said once again, never did I say I felt joy that this man died. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=249.1s)]
*  I said again that I felt joy that millions of Americans or billions of really wealthy [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=253.02s)]
*  Americans and privileged Americans are forcing or forced to wake up to the reality that nearly [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=257.94s)]
*  70,000 Americans die each year due to lack of health insurance. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=262.66s)]
*  I do feel joyful that that is an issue that's being talked about. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=266.02s)]
*  Why would any human being with a conscience and soul be joyful over an assassination of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=269.62s)]
*  any person? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=275.94s)]
*  Why would anybody be joyful over that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=276.98s)]
*  Well, actually, that's a good question. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=278.94s)]
*  Why don't I explain? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=280.54s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=281.54s)]
*  So the other clip that you played is not me saying my own beliefs. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=282.54s)]
*  I have quite different beliefs from that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=287.06s)]
*  What I'm describing, and if you watch the full segment, not just the clip, you'll see [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  that I'm describing the mentality of these fangirls that show up outside Luigi's court [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  and show up outside his jail cell. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=297.98s)]
*  Those girls are not me. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=299.78s)]
*  Okay, we have very separate belief systems, but I was describing how they believe. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=300.78s)]
*  And now let me explain to you why people in America feel this way. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=304.98s)]
*  People in America feel this way and they feel outraged because again, every penny of the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=308.42s)]
*  $22 billion in profit made by United Health was made at the expense and suffering of others. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=312.9s)]
*  And that is violence. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=318.78s)]
*  Our health care system is also violent. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=319.9s)]
*  And that is a violence that people in the mainstream media such as yourself continue [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=322.46s)]
*  to refuse to acknowledge. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=326.26s)]
*  So if you're going to talk about death and violence, it's crucial to talk about the death [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=327.8s)]
*  and violence of our health care system. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=331.6s)]
*  There's a better way than saying that Luigi Mangione is a revolutionary who's famous, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=335.08s)]
*  handsome, young, smart. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=341.56s)]
*  That is what those people believe. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=343.76s)]
*  And seems like he's a morally good man. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=347.64s)]
*  If you want to have legitimate criticism, you could write an intelligent piece saying [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=350.76s)]
*  Here is what's wrong with America's health care system. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  Like for example, I want health care savings accounts. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=359.92s)]
*  I would like to see more of the use of telemedicine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=362.84s)]
*  I believe in health care cooperatives. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=365.44s)]
*  I know one that works. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=367.9s)]
*  Josh Umber, Atlas MD, average person, 24 hour concierge care, 50 bucks a month. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=370.16s)]
*  There are better ways to do it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=377.32s)]
*  That's a legitimate debate. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=378.84s)]
*  But that's not how you're saying it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=380.36s)]
*  You're saying it in ways that are sympathetic to the people that are taking action. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=381.96s)]
*  Handsome, good looking. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=387.56s)]
*  This is why people are happy and joyful. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=389.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm describing the belief system of his supporters, Sean. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=394.52s)]
*  Why don't you condemn them? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=397.76s)]
*  Do you condemn? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  Will you say that anyone that praises this guy is lacking a soul, a conscience and a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  heart? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=407.08s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=408.08s)]
*  Well, what I will say, Sean, once again, is that I believe in free speech. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  I just asked you a very direct question. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  Will you say that anyone that's praising this guy doesn't have a soul, a conscience and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  a heart? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=419.52s)]
*  I don't believe in things like, you know, religious things like souls and all of these [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=420.52s)]
*  things. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm not asking about religious. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  If you can't have sympathy for a dead father and husband, do you lack a conscience, a soul [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  and a heart? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  That's a simple question. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=435.52s)]
*  You're a smart woman. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me respond to you, Sean. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=438.12s)]
*  I believe that every one of the 70,000 Americans that die each year because of lack of health [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=440.12s)]
*  insurance also has a heart. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=445.44s)]
*  You're back to health care and not answering my question. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=446.44s)]
*  I've done this 29 years, Taylor. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  Answer the question. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  If you think it's okay and you celebrate assassination, are you lacking a conscience, a soul and a [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  heart? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=460.12s)]
*  I think once again, you're conflating me explaining the ideology of the women that show up to [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=461.12s)]
*  rationalize them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=466.72s)]
*  If you support assassination, answer, Taylor, answer the question. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=468.72s)]
*  If you support assassination of innocent people, are you lacking a conscience, a soul and a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=474.44s)]
*  heart? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=480.48s)]
*  Simple question. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=481.64000000000004s)]
*  Go. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=482.64000000000004s)]
*  I believe that the assassination of innocent people, we want to talk about the assassination [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=483.92s)]
*  of innocent people. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=488.68s)]
*  I believe that the tens of thousands of Americans that die each year because of the lack of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=489.8s)]
*  health insurance, that is to me a violence in itself. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=495.12s)]
*  That is assassination. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=498.32s)]
*  These are these health insurance. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=499.32s)]
*  I want to have that discussion with you, but we can't have that discussion until you say [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=500.32s)]
*  that, for example, we condemn people that have been committing acts of, do you condemn [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=505.12s)]
*  the people that tried to assassinate Donald Trump or would it be a good thing in your [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=511.84s)]
*  mind if would you understand why people want to kill him or understand why people want [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=515.8s)]
*  to kill Elon Musk? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=520.52s)]
*  You understand them too? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=521.52s)]
*  Are they handsome people too? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=523.0s)]
*  Are they the same people that killed other people? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=524.52s)]
*  Let me talk to you a little bit about that. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=526.84s)]
*  I cover violent extremism. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=528.84s)]
*  I have witnessed violent extremism from many different factions of the political system. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=530.24s)]
*  For instance, if somebody shows up and shoots an abortion provider dead, I want to understand [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=535.92s)]
*  their ideology. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=540.36s)]
*  I am a reporter. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=541.36s)]
*  I want to understand their belief system and I want to understand what led them there. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=542.36s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=545.8s)]
*  It is interesting you bring up the assassination of Donald Trump. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=546.8s)]
*  If you resort to violence and you kill innocent people, are you lacking a conscious soul and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=549.48s)]
*  a heart? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=555.64s)]
*  What's so hard? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=556.64s)]
*  Why won't you answer that question? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=557.64s)]
*  Once again, when you talk about souls, that's not really my specialty, but what I do specialize [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=560.28s)]
*  in is extremism. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=565.0s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=566.0s)]
*  We are at a time right now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=567.0s)]
*  By the way, I would say that's obvious. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=568.0s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=571.0s)]
*  We are at a time right now when we're witnessing, actually one of the biggest memes on the internet [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=572.0s)]
*  right now is about assassinating Trump and Elon. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=575.16s)]
*  These are posts with millions of likes that are advocating for the assassination of the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=577.88s)]
*  president. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=581.64s)]
*  Okay, simple question. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=582.64s)]
*  How does this define a very unstable democracy? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=583.64s)]
*  Can you take a moral stand and condemn that? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=585.2s)]
*  What I condemn is the violence of our system and I would love for you to acknowledge that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=589.16s)]
*  I'm not asking you to condemn the system. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=592.56s)]
*  Do you condemn people that call for assassinations? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=594.52s)]
*  Gosh, you're going to ask me if I condemn Hamas next. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=599.52s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=602.04s)]
*  I would love for you to acknowledge what I'm actually saying, Sean, and we seem to be talking [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=603.04s)]
*  past each other. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=606.28s)]
*  I want to talk about the fact that half of all adults are delayed because of cost. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=607.36s)]
*  We need to talk about the 70% of Americans, by the way, believe that the insurance company [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=612.4s)]
*  practices are responsible in part for Thompson's death. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=616.16s)]
*  These are signs of an unhelpful... [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=619.28s)]
*  You want to put a rationalization. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=620.56s)]
*  I am saying anybody that wants to assassinate any innocent person is wrong. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=622.12s)]
*  I don't care if it's a Democrat or Republican or a father or a husband. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=627.04s)]
*  That is a simple truth that anyone with a heart would easily say on national TV that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=632.96s)]
*  you're having a hard time with. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  If you want to prevent further deaths and you don't want gun violence in the street, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=640.72s)]
*  which I think we both are aligned in wanting, right? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  We want peace. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=646.36s)]
*  We do not want violence in this country, no matter what side of the political aisle it's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=647.36s)]
*  coming from. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=650.6s)]
*  You need to understand motives and you need to understand the ideology that people have. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=651.6s)]
*  And that is what my job is. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=655.52s)]
*  Why don't you first start with the basics? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=656.52s)]
*  I'm going to help you out. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=658.0400000000001s)]
*  Why don't you first condemn those that want to be involved in assassination and stop [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=659.7199999999999s)]
*  talking about them being handsome and smart and intelligent and... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=667.8s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=668.8s)]
*  You said morally upright. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=669.8s)]
*  I am describing his supporters who do believe that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=670.8s)]
*  And I think it's very important. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=674.04s)]
*  Just the way that I would try to understand the ideology of... [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=675.04s)]
*  Will you condemn his supporters? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=677.68s)]
*  Last question. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=678.68s)]
*  Last question. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=679.68s)]
*  ...the people that march and unite the right valley. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=680.68s)]
*  I would try to understand the ideology of anyone that would advocate for violence in this country, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=681.68s)]
*  no matter what it is. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=686.68s)]
*  Do you condemn his supporters? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=687.68s)]
*  Once again, I believe in free speech. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=688.68s)]
*  I believe in free speech. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=689.68s)]
*  They have not committed any crimes. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=690.68s)]
*  I didn't ask you. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=691.68s)]
*  The supporters are outside just saying things. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=692.68s)]
*  They're not committing any sort of acts of violence. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=693.68s)]
*  You won't condemn his supporters. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=694.68s)]
*  You won't say what they're doing is repulsive. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=695.68s)]
*  Once again, Sean, I believe in free speech and the right to free expression. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=696.68s)]
*  I seem to be in the minority these days. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=697.68s)]
*  There's a difference between assassination and speech. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=698.68s)]
*  Do you condemn those that support violence and, in this case, praise Luigi Mangione? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=699.68s)]
*  You asked, again, the people that are out there, the people that are out there, the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=706.68s)]
*  people that are showing up outside to support Luigi. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=714.68s)]
*  We're going around in a circle. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=715.68s)]
*  I gotta go. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=716.68s)]
*  They're exercising their right to free speech. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=717.68s)]
*  There's no hope. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=718.68s)]
*  They're talking about the fact that over 320,000 people died from lack of health insurance [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=719.68s)]
*  in the first two years of the pandemic alone. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=720.68s)]
*  I appreciate you being with us. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=721.68s)]
*  We need to acknowledge if we ever want to fix our system. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=722.68s)]
*  I gotta go. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=723.68s)]
*  We have a violent, violent healthcare system, Sean, and it needs reform, and that's what [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=724.68s)]
*  we should be focusing on. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=725.68s)]
*  That's the violence we should center. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=726.68s)]
*  And people that have a platform like yours should speak out. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=727.68s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=728.68s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=729.68s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=730.68s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=731.68s)]
*  I'm not going to be able to do that. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzD5mR1qc2M&t=732.68s)]
