# Sen. Ted Cruz: Dems are on ‘team Iran’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M)
*  Here now with reaction is Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who was in today's classified briefing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=0.0s)]
*  about the strikes. All right, so we have the low confidence briefing and then we have now the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=6.0s)]
*  Pentagon has weighed in, Israeli intelligence has weighed in, the IAEA has weighed in, even the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=11.6s)]
*  Iranians are talking about more devastation than this low confidence, partially selectively leaked [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=16.56s)]
*  report. Your reaction? Yeah, listen, Sean, the Democrats who are talking to the press, they're [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=23.68s)]
*  lying and they're lying deliberately. They know they're lying. I spent an hour and a half this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  afternoon in a classified briefing, classified briefing with the secretary of state, the secretary [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  of defense, the head of the CIA and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They walked through [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=38.16s)]
*  the operation that was carried out on Saturday night by President Trump. And I've got to tell you, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=43.2s)]
*  the operation was a spectacular success. First of all, our servicemen and women, those airmen that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=47.44s)]
*  carried out the strikes, they flew from Missouri halfway around the world in seven B-2 stealth [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=53.2s)]
*  bombers. They delivered 14 bunker buster bombs precisely on target. Every bomb hit their target [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  to devastating effect. Every one of those bombs is a 30,000 pound bomb. They are the most lethal [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=66.4s)]
*  bombs we have in our entire arsenal other than nuclear weapons. They hit their target precisely. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=73.2s)]
*  In addition to that, we had a submarine that fired 30 Tomahawk missiles and pounded [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=79.04s)]
*  together between the bunker busters and the Tomahawk missiles. We hit three nuclear weapons sites [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=85.12s)]
*  in Iran, utterly devastated them. And then every one of them came home. There was not a single [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=90.4s)]
*  American casualty. This was an incredible American military operation. I commend the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  servicemen and women who carried it out. And I commend the commander in chief who gave the clear [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=103.12s)]
*  headed, clear eyed order, we will defend America because understand the nuclear weapons the Ayatollah [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=107.84s)]
*  was trying to build. His objective was to use those against the United States of America. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=114.4s)]
*  There's a reason the Ayatollah had an ICBM program. An ICBM, as you know, it stands for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=120.4s)]
*  Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. You do not need an ICBM for Iran to fire a missile at Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=126.48s)]
*  They're very close together and Iran's been sending ordinary ballistic missiles to Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=133.52s)]
*  The only reason the Ayatollah has been working to develop an ICBM is to deliver a nuclear warhead [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  to an American city, whether New York or Washington DC or Los Angeles. And President Trump acted [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Saturday night to say, we're going to protect American citizens. We're not going to allow [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=151.12s)]
*  a theocratic lunatic who chants death to America and calls America the great Satan. We're not going [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=156.24s)]
*  to allow him to have weapons that could murder millions of Americans. And the Democrats, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=161.84s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. Every American ought to be cheering. We are safer. Our enemies [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=167.28s)]
*  are weaker. And yet the Democrats have basically decided they're on Team Iran and they're upset [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=172.4s)]
*  that Iran's nuclear weapon facilities have been taken out. I got to tell you, I am cheering on [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=178.72s)]
*  President Trump made exactly the right decision. And Sean, your family and my family are safer [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=184.0s)]
*  because of it. There's no doubt about it. What is your reaction to the legacy media mob and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=189.52s)]
*  getting it wrong as per usual, having an agenda? It's anti-Trump, but in this case, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=197.36s)]
*  they're smearing our military. Yeah, look, they're trying to say it didn't have any impact. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Listen, the reason the American military got involved, Israel had for 12 days been carrying [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=210.08s)]
*  out incredibly effective strikes. They'd been decapitating the senior leadership of the Iranian [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  military. By the way, one after the other, head of the IRGC, Israel would take them out. They'd [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=219.2s)]
*  name someone new, the next day Israel would take them out. They'd name someone new, the next day [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  Israel would take them out. It got to the point, I don't think I could find anyone willing to take [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=229.44s)]
*  that job because when you took that job, you knew you weren't living 24 hours. That gives you a sense [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  of the incredible penetration of the Mossad into Iran and the intelligence they have. Now, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Israel was bombing nuclear research facilities, but the one in particular they couldn't reach was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=243.84s)]
*  Fordow. Fordow is the main nuclear weapons research facility in Iran and they built it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=250.0s)]
*  underneath a gigantic mountain and they did it to protect it from aerial assaults. Israel doesn't [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=255.84s)]
*  have the bunker buster bombs that are needed to take out an underground facility like Fordow and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=262.32s)]
*  that's why President Trump acted. He sent of the 14 bunker busters that were dropped, 12 of them [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=267.68s)]
*  were dropped on Fordow and they were dropped in vents. The initial ones took out the concrete [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  blockade and then they dropped the missiles. The bunker busters are designed to penetrate deep [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  underground and then explode with massive force. You're looking at 360,000 pounds of explosive [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=284.56s)]
*  force and the media and the Democrats are trying to say these bunker buster bombs designed to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=292.72s)]
*  destroy underground bunkers did not actually succeed. There's no intelligence to back that up. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  There's no reason to back that up, but they are cheering for Iran. But I want to say something [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=302.72s)]
*  else, Sean. There are voices in the administration now that the president has scored an historic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  victory who are urging, let's cut a deal. Let's let Iran sell oils. Let's lift all the sanction. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  Let's make this a victory for the Ayatollah. Understand this Ayatollah still hates America. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=320.16s)]
*  He chants death to America and he's been trying to murder Donald Trump and so it would be a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=325.68s)]
*  catastrophic mistake to flood billions of dollars into Iran. I agree with you. What if they use a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  proxy to attack Israel? Does that end the ceasefire? Because I would imagine that's the next plan. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  Real quick. You know, I will tell you one of the best indications of how successful this attack was. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=344.8s)]
*  Within hours, Iran was rushing to have a ceasefire. That's because they are utterly [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=350.32000000000005s)]
*  decimated and weakened and that's why they wanted a ceasefire. But don't think for a minute they [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=355.44s)]
*  suddenly love America or love Israel. They still hate us. They are still our enemy, but we have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  taken away their ability to murder Americans. If they use a proxy to attack Israel, are they to blame? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=365.36s)]
*  Of course they are. The proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, work for Iran. They pay for them and they [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  control them. All right, Senator Ted Cruz, we always appreciate your time, Senator. Thank you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-V1GakwO-M&t=379.04s)]
