*  I consider Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to be the leader of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=4.32s)]
*  She's entitled to her opinion. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=10.4s)]
*  I'm entitled to mine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=12.24s)]

*  bottle. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  And our plan for dealing with her... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  You didn't plan that out. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We got to hurry. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=25.52s)]
*  Our plan for dealing with her is called Operation Let Her Speak. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87kaL2sd1SM&t=26.52s)]
