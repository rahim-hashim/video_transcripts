# Trump reveals 'most exciting part' of the China deal
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI)
*  Mr. President. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi, thank you very much. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=1.0s)]
*  Okay, by the way, we're on a beautiful Air Force One. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=2.0s)]
*  Not a bad plane. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=7.04s)]
*  Not bad at all. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=8.52s)]
*  Not bad at all. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=9.52s)]
*  It's a beautiful plane and we're doing a lot of business. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=10.52s)]
*  We have a lot of good things happening. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=13.56s)]
*  Okay, so this is an amazing week so far. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=15.44s)]
*  You get a deal with China. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=18.6s)]
*  I'm just going to list it and then we can get into detail. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  India and Pakistan played a big role, hopefully. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=23.12s)]
*  The peace stands. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=25.84s)]
*  The U.S. slash prescription drug prices. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=27.48s)]
*  Most favored nation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=31.0s)]
*  The American people will get first dibs in terms of prices. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=32.0s)]
*  The last American hostage has been released. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=36.2s)]
*  We're on this trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=39.8s)]
*  There's not much going on in your life, is there? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=42.56s)]
*  Well, I've been busy, but I've enjoyed it because we're getting things accomplished. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=45.28s)]
*  We're getting things done. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=49.04s)]
*  You know, you can have times when you're working very hard and not getting things done. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=50.04s)]
*  That happens too. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=54.6s)]
*  But we're getting a lot done. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=56.0s)]
*  I don't think there's ever been a little period like this with the potential nuclear war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=57.4s)]
*  And two countries, they have very good leaders, people I know very well. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=62.2s)]
*  And, you know, it was a very important process. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=67.08s)]
*  We got involved with India and Pakistan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=70.56s)]
*  You got involved early. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=73.28s)]
*  Can you give us a little insight what happened behind the scenes? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=74.56s)]
*  How were you able? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=77.08s)]
*  Well, I didn't like what was happening. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=78.64s)]
*  And you hear, you know, they're two very strongly nuclear countries. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=80.48s)]
*  Very, very powerful amount of nuclear too, serious stuff. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=85.52s)]
*  And if that ever started, boy, that's the beginning of something that could be really bad. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=90.16s)]
*  Even a minimal, minimal, you could have millions of people killed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=94.84s)]
*  And with one shot, two shots. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=99.0s)]
*  And I just thought it was something we could get involved in. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=101.8s)]
*  And I did a good job. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=104.44s)]
*  Marco did a good job. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=106.36s)]
*  And JD did a good job. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=108.08s)]
*  We sort of were a team. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  And we, I think, convinced them to let's have peace and let's go and make trade deals. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=111.44s)]
*  If we can make trade deals, we like that much better than nuclear weapons. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  And that was a great thing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=120.8s)]
*  And we did a good job with the Houthis. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=122.64s)]
*  They stopped with the shooting of the ships. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=124.72s)]
*  They like shooting ships. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=127.72s)]
*  Is that a done deal? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=128.88s)]
*  Because there's been conflicting reports that some of their leaders are saying, oh, that's not true. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=129.84s)]
*  Well, it is with respect to America. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=134.64s)]
*  Now, you know, you can't always count on somebody necessarily telling the truth. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=136.44000000000003s)]
*  But their surrogates were very strong, very powerful, very good relationship with them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=141.24s)]
*  You know, they're tough fighters. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=147.44000000000003s)]
*  They can take a lot of punishment. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  But they, with respect to America, they say it's true. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  We'll see. You'll know. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  You'll be the first to know, won't you? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  I follow the news closely. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  I read everything. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=160.4s)]
*  I think the biggest surprise from this weekend. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  It was a week ago Friday where I saw that China announced, quote, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=165.6s)]
*  if the president is serious, we will be willing to negotiate with him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=171.16s)]
*  And Scott Besson, your Treasury secretary, met with their representatives in Geneva on Saturday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=175.36s)]
*  On Monday, you're announcing a trade, well, actually on Sunday, you announced a deal with China. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=184.0s)]
*  How did that happen that quickly? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=191.72s)]
*  Well, they met on Saturday and Sunday and they had a deal pretty much from the beginning. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=192.88s)]
*  It was the concept of a deal. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=196.36s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things that, as you know, it's sort of a 90 day deal as we negotiate other aspects. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=198.56s)]
*  But one of the things I think that could be most exciting for us and also for China is that we're trying to open up China. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=206.44s)]
*  Because, as you know, many years ago, we opened up the USA. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=213.36s)]
*  Now it's time for China to open up. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=216.2s)]
*  And that's part of our deal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=218.56s)]
*  And we're going to open up China. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=220.4s)]
*  To me, that's the most exciting part. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=222.2s)]
*  But, you know, we made a deal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=224.72s)]
*  The relationship is very good. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=225.84s)]
*  I've always had a good relationship with President Xi. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=227.32s)]
*  It was interrupted because of Covid, obviously. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=230.68s)]
*  But outside of that, I've always had a great relationship, a lot of respect for him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=232.8s)]
*  And we'll see how that all works out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  But we have the confines of a very, very strong deal with China. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=241.12s)]
*  But the most exciting part of the deal, it was mentioned, but we don't talk about it yet. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=246.0s)]
*  That's the opening up of China to U.S. business. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=252.56s)]
*  And that would be like opening up a whole new world. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=256.72s)]
*  And I think it would be even better for China. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=259.0s)]
*  So I think we'll be able to make that deal, I hope. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=261.36s)]
*  At any point, do you foresee yourself dealing directly with President Xi on the final details of this deal? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=263.64s)]
*  Yeah, I could see that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=271.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm not sure that it'll be necessary, but that happened with the UK. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  We were close to a deal, but we needed one point or two points on pork and ethanol. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=277.2s)]
*  OK, two very different subjects. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=285.04s)]
*  And I called up the prime minister, who's an excellent man here, excellent man. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=287.36s)]
*  And within about three minutes, it was over. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=293.48s)]
*  We made the deal. It was a good deal for everybody. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  And we have a lot of deals now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=299.56s)]
*  We have a lot of trade deals that I'd say virtually everybody wants to make a deal. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=300.72s)]
*  When I first saw you and thank you for letting us cover this and report on this from Air Force One. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=306.76s)]
*  When I first saw you, I think you were more excited. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=315.04s)]
*  You were excited about the China deal, but prescription drugs, which has been very, very painful for a lot of Americans. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=318.04s)]
*  80 percent of medications are created in America. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  And then we end up paying more for those medications. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  Foreign countries do not pay as much as we do. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=335.08s)]
*  You said that is over. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=337.76s)]
*  Can you explain why this is such a big deal? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=339.0s)]
*  Well, for many years, we were taken advantage of by other countries and the drug companies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  But I blame the other countries in a way more, the European Union, etc. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=345.96s)]
*  They were very nasty and very tough to the drug companies. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  And they would give them a very low price for drug costs in the European nations. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=353.56s)]
*  And when that price was given, that was it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=359.88s)]
*  They wouldn't negotiate. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=362.76s)]
*  They said, let America pay for the difference. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=364.64s)]
*  And this happened all over the world with other countries. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=367.12s)]
*  And we had stupid people leading us, especially over the last four years. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=370.0s)]
*  And they wouldn't do anything about it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=375.32s)]
*  And it turned out that we were paying. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=377.64s)]
*  And sometimes you saw 10 times more for the same drug, same drug. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=379.64s)]
*  Same company, same plant where they make it, laboratory. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=383.68s)]
*  And it got to a point where I said, we're not going to do this anymore. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=387.68s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry is very powerful and probably the most powerful [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=391.76s)]
*  considered the most powerful lobby. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=397.2s)]
*  And the Democrats were making it impossible to lower drug prices. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=399.52s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=403.4s)]
*  And I instituted a most favored nations [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=405.08s)]
*  provision or concept where we're going to pay whatever the lowest country pays in the world. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=409.16s)]
*  So if it's the UK, which pays very low in any country, it could be any country, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=414.92s)]
*  whatever the lowest prices and the drug companies have accepted it, everybody accepts it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=421.16s)]
*  But the Democrats never wanted to play ball. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=427.88s)]
*  They never wanted to do anything. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=430.6s)]
*  It's the Democrats fault that people were being ripped off for years and years. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=432.12s)]
*  And now I hear Democrats saying, oh, well, we're going to now go for the bill. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=436.76s)]
*  It's going to be very hard for them not to approve the big, beautiful bill that we're doing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=439.96s)]
*  We're doing the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  because people are going to be getting a 50 to a 90 percent reduction in drug prices, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=448.28s)]
*  not a half a percent. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  I remember when I would fight so hard to get a half a point. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  And I actually had it down a half a point for one year. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=459.0s)]
*  And I was so proud of myself because that never happened before. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=462.28s)]
*  It was always going up. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=465.56s)]
*  Drugs only went in one direction. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=466.6s)]
*  That's up. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=468.2s)]
*  And now after studying the industry, it's a very complex industry, but I figured it out. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=469.56s)]
*  And I said, it's not going to happen. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=474.12s)]
*  But the Democrats fought very hard to keep the prices of drugs very, very high. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=476.6s)]
*  They really ought to blame for this because they should have done something about it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=481.96s)]
*  And when the Republicans went with requests, they said, we're not going to approve it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=485.8s)]
*  And now we have a unified Republican Party. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=491.08s)]
*  But I think the Democrats are going to approve this bill, too, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=493.8s)]
*  because how are they going to reject a 60, 70, 80 percent drug cut? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=496.12s)]
*  I don't think they can. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=502.12s)]
*  I think it's going to be huge. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=503.8s)]
*  The fact that these drugs, the creation of these drugs, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, these companies have to go through a very arduous process to get approval. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=509.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  By the government. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=514.36s)]
*  They spend billions of dollars and put aside whether or not, quote, people demonize big pharma. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=515.32s)]
*  That's separate and apart. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=522.92s)]
*  However, we usually end up creating them and then we end up paying 10 times more, which is crazy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=524.28s)]
*  Well, they used to use that, if I could interrupt, they used to use that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  as a reason why we were paying five and 10 times more than other countries, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=533.64s)]
*  they say, because of research and development. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=538.36s)]
*  And I'd always say, well, what about you doing research and development for the rest of the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=541.0s)]
*  world, too? Why are we paying for 100 percent? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=544.76s)]
*  So we paid 100 percent for research and development, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=547.16s)]
*  which, along with other things, believe it or not, raise the price to a point where you were five to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  10 times higher than the rest of the world. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=557.16s)]
*  And I told the story today, it was well received. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=559.8s)]
*  A friend of mine who's slightly overweight, to put it mildly, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=561.88s)]
*  went to a drug store in London and he was able to get one of the fat shots. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=566.28s)]
*  I caught the fat shots, the jabs that you lose weight. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=571.0s)]
*  A lot of people laugh at that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=574.92s)]
*  Some people get offended by it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=576.3599999999999s)]
*  I don't get offended by anything. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=577.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm just glad I didn't use his name. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=578.8399999999999s)]
*  He's actually a very rich guy, a very successful guy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=580.44s)]
*  He's glad you didn't use his name. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=582.84s)]
*  No, no, he's very happy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=584.12s)]
*  He knows exactly who I was talking about. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  He called. He said that was interesting. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=587.4s)]
*  He said he was very concerned that I might use his name. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  It might slip. No, he doesn't have to worry. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=592.04s)]
*  But he went to London and he bought this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=594.2s)]
*  Ozempic will go over you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=599.08s)]
*  One of those. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=600.36s)]
*  I guess. Yeah, I'm not sure which one. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=600.92s)]
*  But he bought he bought one of them, maybe Ozempic. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=602.92s)]
*  And he bought it and he called me. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=606.6s)]
*  He said, hey, strange thing happened. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=608.76s)]
*  I just bought a drug. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=611.72s)]
*  Same company, same plan, same everything. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=613.3199999999999s)]
*  Everything was the same. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=616.2s)]
*  In one case, I paid in New York, $1300. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=617.8s)]
*  And in London, I'm paying $88. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=621.64s)]
*  He said, what's going on? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=624.52s)]
*  Now, he knew nothing. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=625.88s)]
*  He's a very smart guy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=626.52s)]
*  He's a very rich guy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=627.4s)]
*  His big problem is he's seriously overweight. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=629.4s)]
*  But I don't think the drug worked, OK, to be honest with you. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=631.56s)]
*  But it makes him feel good anyway. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=634.12s)]
*  But so what happens is he just. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=636.36s)]
*  He said to me, I paid $88 in New York. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=638.44s)]
*  I get it for 1300 or something. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=642.2800000000001s)]
*  A massive difference. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=644.5200000000001s)]
*  And I said, that's right. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=646.36s)]
*  The drug laws are very screwed up. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=647.4000000000001s)]
*  And I'm doing something about it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=648.84s)]
*  He said, you better, because this is crazy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=650.84s)]
*  He didn't understand it, but he didn't understand why. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=652.7600000000001s)]
*  And now he understands why because he watched our news conference this morning. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=656.44s)]
*  Holding his breath. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=660.6s)]
*  But he watched his news coverage. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=661.8000000000001s)]
*  But think of it. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=663.6400000000001s)]
*  So he goes to London and a lot of people go shopping. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=664.6s)]
*  Nearby or even far away countries. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  And they'll go away once a month or once a week or something. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=669.9599999999999s)]
*  If it's a nearby country, they'll go right across the border and they'll buy the same [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=672.76s)]
*  drug for one tenth the price as we pay in the United States. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=676.28s)]
*  And part of is the power of the drug companies, which is a very big power. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=679.9599999999999s)]
*  But I think a bigger part is the ruthlessness of other nations [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  to screw the United States of America. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=690.04s)]
*  And the European Union would be the top because they represent a lot of countries [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=692.6s)]
*  and they're brutal. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=697.1600000000001s)]
*  And according to the drug companies, some of this, they're brutal in negotiations. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=697.88s)]
*  They say this is what we're going to pay. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=702.12s)]
*  We're not going to pay any more. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=704.12s)]
*  And if you need more, you get it from America. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  And so they get a low price and we get a high price. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=708.44s)]
*  And I ended it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=711.24s)]
*  And this has been going on for many years, but nobody realized that you could do. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=712.12s)]
*  I think I figured out the system. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=717.88s)]
*  Very complex chain of events take place. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  And I ended it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=722.44s)]
*  And I have to say the drug companies were great. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=724.2s)]
*  They were great. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=727.08s)]
*  They said, look, it's time. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=727.96s)]
*  They actually looked, they said, it's time. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNRjM2dynKI&t=730.76s)]
