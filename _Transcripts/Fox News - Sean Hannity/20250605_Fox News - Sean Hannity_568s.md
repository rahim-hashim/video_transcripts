# Here's why Trump-Musk rift is ‘not unexpected,’ says Hannity
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk)
*  But we begin tonight with a flurry of activity today at 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue. And yes, let not your heart be troubled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=0.0s)]
*  I will address the battle between President Trump and Elon Musk. I know it's of such great [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=7.16s)]
*  International importance, but first there is fresh scrutiny surrounding Joe Biden [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=13.32s)]
*  In a hard-working AutoPen. Take a look [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=17.96s)]
*  Somebody said AutoPen [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=21.56s)]
*  Because I think it's the biggest scandal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=24.44s)]
*  Maybe in the last hundred years in this country. So when I hear that word, I think it has to be discussed because [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  The fake news will try and you know hide it and we can't do that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=34.24s)]
*  We can't ever allow that to happen to our country the danger our country is in and I know some of the people that worked [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=37.78s)]
*  With him look radical left horrible people and I could give you the name of some of the people that use the AutoPen because I'm here [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=44.44s)]
*  And I asked questions about people that were here also [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=51.3s)]
*  There are a lot of people that were here when that happened and they're here right now and they'll answer your question very accurately [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=54.04s)]
*  But I know some of the people that use that AutoPen and those are not the people that had the same ideology as Joe Biden [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=60.76s)]
*  These were radical left lunatics that use that and they didn't get elected. Oh [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=68.36s)]
*  We've been saying it and Trump is right [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=74.56s)]
*  This is the biggest scandal in White House and presidential history [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=76.56s)]
*  Everyone knew that Biden was a cognitive mess [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Everyone covered it up and then the questions are who knew what when did they know it and who was really making the decisions? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  We need answers. That is a constitutional crisis of a magnitude [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=90.8s)]
*  We've never seen before but this is already humiliating for Democrats and Joe Biden and today the former president or [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=94.94s)]
*  Somebody working for him was forced to release a written statement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=101.92s)]
*  Promising that Joe was actually in charge during his time in the White House quote [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=106.12s)]
*  I made the decisions about the pardons the executive orders [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=110.16s)]
*  Legislation proclamations any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous. It is false [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=114.62s)]
*  I don't even have confidence that he wrote that and nobody should [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=120.64s)]
*  Now, of course to most Americans with eyes to see and ears to hear it doesn't seem so ridiculous [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=125.64s)]
*  You see Joe couldn't make his way down from a podium without plenty of direction [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=131.32s)]
*  So it's kind of hard to believe that he was calling the shots on dozens and thousands in the end pardons other complex [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  Complex executive actions was he even aware that an auto pen was being used to sign so many official actions [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=144.12s)]
*  We need answers now the House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is now officially subpoenaed Biden's White House doctor [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=151.26s)]
*  This [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=158.6s)]
*  Investigation is off and running now. Meanwhile back at the White House another high-stakes international call today now yesterday [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=159.72s)]
*  It was Putin. Well today it was President Xi of China. Take a look [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=166.28s)]
*  we had a very good talk and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=171.16s)]
*  We've straightened out any complexity. This is very complex stuff and we straighten it out [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  The agreement was we're gonna have Scott and Howard and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=180.56s)]
*  Jameson will be going and meeting with their top people and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=186.96s)]
*  Continued forward, but no, I think we have everything. I think we're in very good shape with China and the trade deal [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=191.12s)]
*  We have a deal with China as you know, but we were straightening out some of the points having to do mostly with rare earth [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=197.28s)]
*  Magnets and some other things [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=206.84s)]
*  Now just to compare and contrast Donald Trump is holding China accountable while engaging in tough [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=209.0s)]
*  But thoughtful negotiations I predicted from the beginning [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=214.84s)]
*  We will come to a resolution because China does need access to our markets and we need things for them like rare earths [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=218.16s)]
*  For example, at least temporarily under Biden China [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=224.76s)]
*  They were given a free pass to do whatever they wanted and put massive tariffs on our products and prevent American [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=227.6s)]
*  Manufacturing from even having a shot at their markets now [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=234.12s)]
*  In fact Biden's DOJ even shut down Donald Trump's China initiative now [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=237.08s)]
*  That was the China focused espionage program at a time when China's spying was getting worse and worse and worse and Joe even let [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=242.38s)]
*  Chinese nationals member big scandal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=250.02s)]
*  It's still a scandal buy up thousands and thousands of acres of farmland ranch land land near our military [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  Installations you think President Xi would allow any American national in China to do that in China [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=260.38s)]
*  Can I go into China by farmland or ranch land or land near their military? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=266.38s)]
*  Installation I don't think so just this week a really dumb decision Arizona's Democratic liberal leftist governor Katie Hobbs [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=271.58000000000004s)]
*  Inexplicably vetoed a bill banning the Chinese nationals from buying up land near our US military bases [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=280.62s)]
*  This is reckless. This is dangerous. The Democratic Party's track record on China is horrific and don't even get me started on the spy balloon [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  I'll lose my mind [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=294.66s)]
*  Now of course the legacy media mob they would rather you focus and obsess [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=296.14s)]
*  About the current conflict between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump now the rift between these two men [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=301.78s)]
*  Be the first to say it's sad. It's unfortunate [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  These are two titans of American industry and culture two very strong-willed heavyweights [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  You have the president of the free world the richest guy on earth one of the smartest guys on earth [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=318.7s)]
*  Conflicts they're kind of predictable is it aren't they you know you don't have to be a genius to figure out that is likely to happen [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=323.86s)]
*  It's not unexpected to be honest. They disagree on policy. They even said in their last meeting in the White House [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=331.5s)]
*  Yeah, we agree about 80% of the time they have disagreements, and they both fight back hard no shock there either [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=338.06s)]
*  They wouldn't be where they are if they didn't but when I interviewed them together [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=344.42s)]
*  The first thing I said to them and talked about and asked them you know you do know that the media mob [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=348.86s)]
*  the legacy media mob desperately wants to tear you guys apart and for you two to fight and to get a divorce and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=354.92s)]
*  now the media mob is predictably they're predictably elated and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=361.9s)]
*  It got personal Elon Musk claiming quote Trump is in the Epstein files. That's the real reason [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  They have not been made public well. It's been well known that Donald Trump said [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=372.64s)]
*  That Elon was angry over Trump's decision to end the electric vehicle mandate. I can certainly understand why Elon [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  You know wants that in the one big beautiful bill pretty obvious pretty apparent [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=385.82s)]
*  Understandable difference and on the Epstein issue wasn't it Donald Trump he booted Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago nearly 20 [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=390.98s)]
*  years ago [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=398.46s)]
*  Because he was one of the first people to realize just how horrible Epstein really was and by all accounts [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=399.54s)]
*  He was kicked out because of his treatment of young women now Democrats and the media [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=405.3s)]
*  I'm just thinking out loud here. I'm just wondering putting two and two together [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=411.1s)]
*  I truly wonder if our old friend Bill Clinton. How you doing good to talk to you [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=415.86s)]
*  You know he had a relationship with Epstein that's been reported on [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=421.7s)]
*  Is he in the are he is Bill Clinton is he in those files also I? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=425.98s)]
*  Can't say for sure I haven't seen them, but if I was a betting man [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=430.74s)]
*  I know where I'd put my money now if by some you know chance that Bill Clinton is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=434.38s)]
*  In there. I wonder if he kicked Epstein out of his life as [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=441.78s)]
*  Publicly as Donald Trump did I guess if Donald Trump felt that Epstein had something on him [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=447.18s)]
*  He probably wouldn't have kicked him out of his club [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=452.21999999999997s)]
*  Inquiring minds. I think they'll want to know that so let's be very blunt here big deal [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=455.02s)]
*  It's an online public spat between two very powerful men over what is really a policy difference [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=458.78s)]
*  It got personal and still despite all the bad blood. I'm gonna make a bold prediction. I could be wrong [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=464.5s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump and Elon Musk they'll work it out eventually [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=471.14s)]
*  They'll become friends again now after all it was only a week ago that the pair were praising each other in the Oval Office [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=474.86s)]
*  Remember Trump gifted Musk a gold key to the White House. I don't know if he's changing the locks or not take a look [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=481.74s)]
*  Elon gave an incredible service. Nobody like him and he had to go through the slings and the arrows [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=488.58s)]
*  which is a shame because [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=496.3s)]
*  He's an incredible patriot [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=498.3s)]
*  The good news is that 90% of the country knows that and they appreciate it and they really appreciate what he did [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=499.9s)]
*  And I gave a little special something we have here. Thank you a very special [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=506.53999999999996s)]
*  That I give to very special people I have given it to some [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=511.34s)]
*  But they goes to very special people and I thought I'd give it to Elon as a presentation from our country [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=516.22s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=523.26s)]
*  I [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=526.66s)]
*  Think the doors team is doing an incredible job. They're going to continue doing to doing an incredible job and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=527.78s)]
*  And I'll be and I'll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and advisor to [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=533.9s)]
*  The president and I look forward to you know times being back in this amazing room [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=540.34s)]
*  All right, that was less than a week ago. These are two very talented individuals frankly [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=545.62s)]
*  They don't need each other to be successful, but I do hope they work it out and set an example for the rest of the country [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTpt7hzGxsk&t=549.62s)]
