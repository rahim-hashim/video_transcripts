# Trump is showing the world ‘AMERICA IS BACK’: Sen. Katie Britt
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0)
*  Despite a week-long smear campaign from the media mob, the praise for President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=0.0s)]
*  decision to take out Iran's nuclear program is widespread, from leaders at home and abroad. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=4.64s)]
*  Here now with more, Alabama Senator Katie Britt. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=11.42s)]
*  Senator Britt, what are you hearing even from Democratic colleagues across the aisle in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=14.96s)]
*  these briefings and in everyday conversation? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=19.28s)]
*  I mean, don't they have some grudge and respect for what President Trump has done [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=21.72s)]
*  here? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=25.6s)]
*  They have to. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=26.6s)]
*  Look, this week, President Trump showed the world that under his leadership, America is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=28.0s)]
*  back. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=34.56s)]
*  It feels good to be an American and have a leader and a commander-in-chief who is in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=35.84s)]
*  control and in command. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=40.84s)]
*  When you're looking at what President Trump has accomplished this week, he has ensured [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=43.44s)]
*  that American capability, our deterrence, is on full display. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=47.92s)]
*  He has shown America first policies at practice with what he's achieved. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=53.06s)]
*  It has truly been remarkable. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=58.2s)]
*  Not only has President Trump been just amazing and defined, divide all odds, you look at [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=60.78s)]
*  what his cabinet has achieved, you look at these men and women in uniform, their flawless [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=66.62s)]
*  execution. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=71.22s)]
*  There was a vision, a plan and a will to execute. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=72.62s)]
*  And what we saw take place over this last week has to make every single American, regardless [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  of what side of the aisle you sit on, stand up a little bit taller and have that pride [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=82.12s)]
*  in what we're capable of and knowing that America, because of President Trump, is back [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=87.72s)]
*  in a rightful place on the world stage. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=93.32s)]
*  So Senator Britt, because of President Trump's leadership and his command, literally, you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=95.8s)]
*  have obliterated, we've obliterated the Iran nuclear program, but then it was followed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=100.74s)]
*  by a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=104.4s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=106.72s)]
*  And now even today, unbelievable, and even today the president, in answer of a reporter's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=107.72s)]
*  question, said, we're working on Gaza as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=111.04s)]
*  So speaking of people who should take notice, do you think this has an impact on other strong [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=114.6s)]
*  men like Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping when they're looking at Ukraine or Taiwan? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=119.44s)]
*  Tell us about that, Senator Britt. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=124.84s)]
*  Oh, without a doubt. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=126.52s)]
*  You know that Xi Jinping, you know that Vladimir Putin, we're watching and watching what [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=128.0s)]
*  President Trump achieved. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=133.16s)]
*  You think about this 36-hour mission that was executed with precision and flawlessness. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=134.88s)]
*  You think about the damage that ensued. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=141.36s)]
*  You think about then President Trump bringing Israel and Iran, two parties that no one thought [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=144.0s)]
*  they would see in their lifetime at the same table, quickly to the same table, bringing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=149.24s)]
*  a ceasefire and working on a pathway forward. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=153.76s)]
*  You have to know that Putin and Xi Jinping are looking there and shaking their head and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=157.24s)]
*  thinking America is back. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=161.92s)]
*  Donald Trump means what he says. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump will not let anyone take advantage of him or the American people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  And we all should take notice. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  I think that you will see a change in behavior across the board. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  I think you're already seeing those under toes, as you even just remarked. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you talk about also what he's achieved this week. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  You mentioned it in your opening, but with the Congo and Rwanda, when you're looking at [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=182.6s)]
*  what he did achieve with Pakistan and India. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=187.0s)]
*  People know that President Trump is here to create a peaceful environment and to make [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  sure that America is in the strongest position possible. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=194.16s)]
*  I mean, not only do they have to be taking note, but, Kellyanne, we saw that other countries [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=196.76s)]
*  are taking note at NATO. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=202.22s)]
*  We finally are seeing Europe step up to the plate in the way that they should, but never [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=203.92s)]
*  would, but are because President Trump has laid down a marker and said, let's all get [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  on board. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=213.04s)]
*  It's time to do something different. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=214.1s)]
*  to pay your fair share and look at what's happening. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=216.66s)]
*  We're seeing an absolute change in the landscape and the dynamic, and no one else could have [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=219.7s)]
*  achieved this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  You know, when people underestimate President Trump, they always end up on the wrong end [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  of that because he is able to achieve what no one else can. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=230.22s)]
*  And I am looking forward to what next week has to bring because this week was surely [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=233.62s)]
*  something remarkable. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=237.82s)]
*  I feel like we say it all the time, but it could have been the best week of his presidency [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=238.82s)]
*  so far. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=241.94s)]
*  We said that before. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=242.94s)]
*  So great to have you here tonight, but I wanted to ask you quickly about the big, beautiful [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=243.94s)]
*  bill. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=247.1s)]
*  There seems to be some hand-wringing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=248.1s)]
*  Is the July 4th deadline necessary? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=249.1s)]
*  Is it artificial? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=251.1s)]
*  What is the prospect that this will actually pass? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=252.82s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=255.82s)]
*  And will conservatives feel like it achieved many of the Trump priorities? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=257.14s)]
*  Oh, it absolutely is going to achieve many and all of Trump's priorities that he's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=260.98s)]
*  putting out there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=265.7s)]
*  And look, we are just getting started. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=266.7s)]
*  President Trump laid out a vision for the American people, and on November 5th, the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=268.7s)]
*  is what we want. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=273.3s)]
*  Get to work and execute. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=274.5s)]
*  We have been working tirelessly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  I think today we finished our 51st meeting on the big, beautiful bill, talking about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=277.82s)]
*  different perspectives, trying to make sure that it's the very best product for the American [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=283.02s)]
*  people. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=286.9s)]
*  We're going to ensure that we secure our border, that that's not just for now, but we're doing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=287.9s)]
*  that for generations to come. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=291.48s)]
*  We're going to make sure that the defense capabilities are of the utmost importance [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=293.46s)]
*  and that our warfighter is the best trained, equipped and ready across the planet. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=297.42s)]
*  I think we have seen over the last several weeks, and this week in particular, how important [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=301.58s)]
*  that is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=305.82s)]
*  We're going to unleash American energy, Kellyanne. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=306.82s)]
*  We know it's important not only for our economy, but it's also important for national security. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=309.5s)]
*  And then when you look at the tax breaks that we're going to have for everyday, hardworking [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=314.58s)]
*  Americans, President Trump has ensured, whether it's no tax on tips or no tax on overtime, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=319.3s)]
*  that we are putting the American people first. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=325.14s)]
*  We're giving them more of their hard-earned money right back in their pocket. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=327.06s)]
*  And we're going to make significant strides. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=330.7s)]
*  This is a generational change, and it's exciting to get to be a part of it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=332.3s)]
*  The way you describe it, it's a shame that a single Democratic colleague of yours in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=336.06s)]
*  the United States Senate has come forth to support this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=339.42s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=341.78s)]
*  Senator Britt, thank you very much. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NTzrZl0iY0&t=342.78s)]
