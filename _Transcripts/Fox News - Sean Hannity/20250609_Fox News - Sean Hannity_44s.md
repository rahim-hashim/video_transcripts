**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc)
*  The more that they protest and commit acts of violence against law enforcement officers, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=0.0s)]
*  the harder ICE is going to kind of come after them, because these people are patriots. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=5.88s)]
*  These ICE officers are people who are fighting for their country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=9.84s)]
*  And I'm so proud of them. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=13.32s)]
*  They've acted with dignity. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=14.88s)]
*  They've acted with grace under stressful situations. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=16.32s)]
*  And when they've been disrespected, they've responded appropriately under the law to make [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  sure that they were treating every single individual the same and making sure that due [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=24.38s)]
*  process was followed and that they were doing their jobs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=28.819999999999997s)]
*  So this is an unfortunate situation that we see violence and instigators out there. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=31.5s)]
*  But the president Trump is really dedicated to bringing peace again. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCId5rVtyc&t=37.42s)]
