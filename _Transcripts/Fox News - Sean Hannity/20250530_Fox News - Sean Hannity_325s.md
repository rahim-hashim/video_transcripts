# Newt Gingrich: Biden is being exploited
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28)
*  Here with reaction, former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Kingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=0.0s)]
*  Look, you're the great historian, you're a former professor and a friend of mine, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=5.2s)]
*  and to me this is the biggest presidential White House scandal in history. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=10.4s)]
*  Now, I'm not letting go of this. I want to know who knew what, when they knew it, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  and who was in charge. And I want to know more about the AutoPen. Am I wrong to care that much [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=20.64s)]
*  about this? No, I think there are two really different stories. I mean, one is [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=25.04s)]
*  the Biden cover-up story, since clearly sometime maybe by 2023 he was clearly not there anymore. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=32.48s)]
*  But the other much deeper story is who was actually running the country, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=40.24s)]
*  who was making the decision. You know, on one day after the election, he signed 2,400 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  commutations with an AutoPen. Now, who picked those 2,400 people? Who was responsible? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=52.32s)]
*  You can go through issue after issue, decision after decision. People were clearly breaking the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=58.88s)]
*  law. They were clearly abusing power. We have no idea why or how much. This dwarfs any preceding [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=64.32s)]
*  scandal ever in American history. I mean, by the time we get done and find out how many people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  were exploiting Biden, and it's really he's being exploited. I mean, this is a guy, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=78.56s)]
*  he's out of it. He's not there anymore. And these people are exploiting him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Is this elder abuse? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=88.56s)]
*  Well, of course it's elder abuse. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=90.4s)]
*  Is this elder abuse? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=91.76s)]
*  Yes, this happened here. Look, if somebody in a nursing home were being as lied about and as [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=91.92s)]
*  covered up as Biden, it would be a crime. I mean, this is a guy who was trotted out, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=98.48s)]
*  and I think humiliated. And so in my mind, one story is the cover-up of Biden. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=107.44s)]
*  But the second, ultimately bigger story, is who was running the government, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=114.88s)]
*  who was violating the Constitution, who were they related to? They clearly had to know each other. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  They were clearly colluding. A lot of it, I think, is going to go back to Barack Obama [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=126.16s)]
*  and his staff, which were all through the White House. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  But billions were being shoveled out, to use the term the secretary of energy used. They were [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=134.0s)]
*  shoveling billions of dollars out. Who was making these decisions? They were commuting. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=138.55999999999997s)]
*  More people were commuted by Biden after the election than I think in the last 10 presidencies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=144.64s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Now, he's not doing any of this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  You know. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=154.56s)]
*  So, and then, of course, you have the media, which is now, I think, in the same freefall [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=155.04s)]
*  as the Democratic Party, as a totally dishonest, totally disreputable institution. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=160.08s)]
*  But, you know, in many ways, they paid a price. I mean, I said in 07, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  journalism's dead. I said after this election, legacy media's dead. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=169.68s)]
*  Now, think back. You know, they all got the Russia hoax wrong. They never reported on the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=173.68s)]
*  bought-and-paid-for Hillary Clinton dirty Russian dossier. They never reported on how that dossier, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=180.56s)]
*  which is totally debunked, was used for four FISA warrants, ruined Carter Page's life, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  a backdoor to spy on Trump and his presidency and his campaign. They never reported on the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=192.72s)]
*  real valuation of Mar-a-Lago, the double standard rating Mar-a-Lago, but not going after Hillary [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  Clinton or Joe Biden. They had top secret classified documents, not telling the truth [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=204.96s)]
*  about Alvin Bragg and the statute of limitations being up and this novel legal theory, or Letitia [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=210.24s)]
*  James running on I'm going to get Trump. They never reported on it, just like they're wrong on [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=216.08s)]
*  Richard Jewell and Duke Lacrosse and UVA and Ferguson, Missouri, and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  They are wrong all the time. How do they get away with it? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=228.8s)]
*  JOHN YANG, The New York Times, The Washington Post [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  Right. Well, they have huge momentum for having been there. NBC, CBS, ABC, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  these are big institutions. The New York Times, The Washington Post, they're big institutions. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  It takes a while to die. But the fact is, I always refer to them now as the... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=245.68s)]
*  JOHN YANG, The New York Times, The Washington Post, It takes a while to die. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=250.72s)]
*  Well, it does. It's a reality. But you're watching them. I'm a historian. You're watching them decay. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  You're watching them to lose any kind of public belief. And I think what you're going to see [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=259.12s)]
*  happen more and more. People just go to alternative sources. And these news media, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=264.16s)]
*  they are propaganda media. They are not news media. We should never refer to them as news media. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  JOHN YANG, The New York Times, The Washington Post [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  I think you're right. And on the one hand, maybe I should be grateful, especially with the legacy [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=277.52s)]
*  media, because all those issues that I mentioned, we got right and they got wrong. And I'm not [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  looking for a Pulitzer Prize. I'd like to keep doing my job for as long as I can. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=288.32s)]
*  And I'm grateful to be able to do it every day. But how they could be that wrong so often. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=292.32s)]
*  And I think Americans don't trust them anymore. They threw everything they could at Trump. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=297.84s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=301.44s)]
*  Didn't work, did it? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=302.0s)]
*  Maybe we should invent an honesty prize. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=303.2s)]
*  Yes, you're right. We will call it the Newt Gingrich Award. Anyway, Mr. Speaker, thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3i7UGga28&t=306.64s)]
