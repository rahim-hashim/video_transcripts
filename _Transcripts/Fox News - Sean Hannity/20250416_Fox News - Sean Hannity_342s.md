# Pam Bondi: Every American should be thanking Trump tonight
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw)
*  First is the U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi, is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=0.0s)]
*  Pam, great to see you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=3.1s)]
*  I want to put up on the screen a timeline, because there seems to be, in the media especially, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=4.1s)]
*  a narrative that is completely and totally and utterly false regarding, quote, Mr. Garcia. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=9.52s)]
*  And not one, but two courts actually said he was an MS-13 gang member and identified [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=16.96s)]
*  him as such. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=23.88s)]
*  Can you please explain what you know about him? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=24.88s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, factually. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=27.16s)]
*  This is an extremely disturbing case. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=29.88s)]
*  And as a career prosecutor, it is even more disturbing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=32.96s)]
*  Every American tonight should be thanking Donald Trump for making America safer by getting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=37.04s)]
*  this guy out of our country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=42.28s)]
*  I'm going to call him a terrorist, because he has been designated as a member of a terrorist [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  organization. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  So, this illegal alien terrorist came into our country illegally in March of 2012. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  We know that, because he admitted that when he was stopped in 2019 by the anti-gang squad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=56.52s)]
*  They stopped him at a Home Depot with three other members. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=65.08s)]
*  And here's what's very important. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=69.36s)]
*  He was wearing a sweatshirt with gang insignia on it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=71.08s)]
*  The guy he was with, another MS-13 known member, had a tattoo with very similar insignia on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  ICE declared him as a member of MS-13. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=85.16s)]
*  The police officers, the gang unit, declared him as a member of MS-13. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=88.76s)]
*  And also, they independently went to a reliable confidential informant who said not only is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=94.0s)]
*  he a member of MS-13, he gave them the clique, the Westerns, and he was called a Chicao, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  which is one of the higher-ranking MS-13 members. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  So they rightfully detained him, rightfully. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=112.8s)]
*  An immigration judge agreed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=116.84s)]
*  An appellate immigration judge agreed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=119.2s)]
*  Now, here's where it gets even more frightening. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=121.8s)]
*  In 2021, his girlfriend previously, his wife at the time, who he had married in jail after [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=124.84s)]
*  he'd gotten numerous tickets, didn't show up for court, he marries her in jail, she [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=131.56s)]
*  has a baby with him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=136.42s)]
*  As a career domestic violence prosecutor, too, I know it takes a lot for any woman to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=138.64s)]
*  come into court and say they're a victim of domestic violence. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=144.64s)]
*  This woman came into court twice getting a restraining order against him, saying it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=148.92s)]
*  horrific. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  He had beaten her, he had punched her in the eye, he had ripped her clothes off. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=157.56s)]
*  What causes a young mother to do this? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=162.04s)]
*  Her child was with her. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=163.88s)]
*  She talked about her child in the petition for an injunction for safety. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=165.42s)]
*  Ultimately, she didn't show up for court. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  That's your typical domestic violence victim. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=173.14s)]
*  But this victim was even braver because she was married to one of the top MS-13 members [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  who was illegally in our country and a terrorist. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=183.04s)]
*  So now he gets— [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=187.1s)]
*  Can you explain— [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=188.1s)]
*  Oh, go ahead, Sean. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=189.1s)]
*  Oh, sorry, Pam. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=190.1s)]
*  Finish. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=191.1s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=192.1s)]
*  You finish. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=193.1s)]
*  So Sean, he under Donald Trump's incredible plan to get these alien enemies, these terrorists [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=194.26s)]
*  out of our country, he is deported. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=201.18s)]
*  He is deported back to where he came from, El Salvador. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=203.94s)]
*  He is sitting in a prison, and every American should be thanking President Trump tonight. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=207.72s)]
*  And every liberal journalist who has called him a Maryland man and saying he was rightfully [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=213.26s)]
*  in this country should be apologizing tonight to President Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm trying to understand that part. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=223.1s)]
*  And I'm looking at the timeline. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm looking at what the courts have said about him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=227.94s)]
*  I'm looking at what ICE has said about him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=229.82s)]
*  I'm looking at—even though I'm having a hard time understanding why his wife is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=231.66s)]
*  advocating for him to come back, why is everybody saying he's a man from Maryland? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=237.7s)]
*  What do you make of Senator Van Hollen and, you know, this performative art that he's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=243.66s)]
*  in El Salvador and of which he was unsuccessful today? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=249.1s)]
*  Well, America is safer because he is gone. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=252.9s)]
*  Maryland is safer because he is gone. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  And that woman that he is married to and that child he had with her, they are safer tonight [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=261.02s)]
*  because he is out of our country and sitting in El Salvador where he belongs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=267.3s)]
*  These people are there saying because we needed to do—the government needed to do one extra [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=274.62s)]
*  step there saying of paperwork. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=280.94s)]
*  Here's why. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=282.98s)]
*  Because initially he claimed there was a rival gang—so he's saying he's a gang member. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=283.98s)]
*  There's a rival gang in El Salvador, which no longer exists, by the way, that could have [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=289.26000000000005s)]
*  hurt him if he had gone back to El Salvador. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=293.86s)]
*  So by—there was no ending for him, none, where he would end up staying in this country. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=297.26s)]
*  And President Bukele made it crystal clear that he is not returning him to our country. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=304.52s)]
*  Our only job legally was to facilitate it if, according to the Supreme Court, President [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=311.52s)]
*  Bukele wanted him to come back to our country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=317.2s)]
*  And he does not want him back. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=320.68s)]
*  And we do not want him back in our country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=322.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi, thank you for setting the record straight. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmCSYrtPLiw&t=327.47999999999996s)]
