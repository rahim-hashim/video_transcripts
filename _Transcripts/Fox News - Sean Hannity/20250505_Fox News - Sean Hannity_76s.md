# Kristi Noem rips Dems for ‘using fear to control people’ #shorts #news #politics #trump #us #world
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo)
*  Let me get your reaction, Tom Homan referring Congresswoman AOC to the Justice Department. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=0.0s)]
*  She had a webinar, Know Your Rights, and as part of it recommended that illegal immigrants [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=8.06s)]
*  ask for warrants, deploy phones, to record ICE searches, tips on how to differentiate [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=14.3s)]
*  between ICE people and others. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=20.92s)]
*  Is this what you see, and I'm sure you've looked at it, is this aiding and abetting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=24.84s)]
*  in your view? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=29.6s)]
*  I think the Department of Justice absolutely should look into this situation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=31.64s)]
*  We've seen not just those that serve in public office be willing to break the law, to facilitate [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=36.0s)]
*  the invasion that has happened and allow criminals to stay here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=41.88s)]
*  We've also seen judges take radical action to help protect these criminals. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=45.02s)]
*  It's time that we stand for what's right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=50.32s)]
*  The American people are sick of these people abusing our system to try to promote an agenda. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=52.6s)]
*  The Democrats are using fear to control people. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=59.2s)]
*  They're out there motivating people by fear and they're standing alongside known terrorists [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=62.32s)]
*  in order to endanger our future. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=66.8s)]
*  I think it's entirely appropriate that the Department of Justice look into these situations. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVIvmbkyxo&t=69.4s)]
