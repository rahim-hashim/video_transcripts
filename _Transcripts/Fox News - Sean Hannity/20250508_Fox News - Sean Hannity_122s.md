# DIDDY DO IT?: Prospective jurors for Diddy trial quizzed on Mike Myers, infidelity, music
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo)
*  Here with more Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. Oh boy. This is gonna get very interesting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know these jurors were actually required Sean to review a binder of celebrity names is sort of who's who of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=7.24s)]
*  Music and entertainment Kanye West kid Cuddy Mike Myers Michael B. Jordan not the basketball player the actor [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=14.56s)]
*  It's unclear really [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=22.64s)]
*  Just how they're connected to this case and it doesn't mean that they did anything wrong [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=24.76s)]
*  But their names are sure to come up apparently according to the prosecution [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=30.36s)]
*  So we'll wait and see but for right now comes defense team is laser [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=34.06s)]
*  Focused on weeding out jurors who may have a bias against their client [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=38.8s)]
*  Particularly those who have already seen that horrific video of comes relentlessly kicking and beating his girlfriend in a hotel [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=43.88s)]
*  Hallway that is the kind of thing you cannot [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=51.48s)]
*  Unsee and some of these potential jurors said yet violent. It's scary. It's disgusting [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=55.36s)]
*  But the judge pointed out that's not disqualifying the question becomes can you set aside your revulsion and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=61.6s)]
*  Judge the accused fairly and impartially also these jurors were asked about their own personal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=69.24s)]
*  Experiences with domestic abuse and sexual assault because that's the core of the sex trafficking case [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=75.86s)]
*  Against combs how he allegedly used threats coercion drugs to control and sexually debilitating [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=82.38s)]
*  Abuse women he's pled not guilty his defense is that this was all [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=89.78s)]
*  Consensual but you know given all the evidence coupled with the anticipated testimony of victims [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=95.42s)]
*  That's gonna be a very hard sell to this jury [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=101.3s)]
*  All right, Greg Jarrett. This is gonna be a big trial. Thank you. Hey Sean Hannity here [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg9Zg91mPo&t=106.14s)]
