# The FBI has never recovered from Comey's failures, ex-agent argues
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU)
*  Here now with reaction to the breaking news, former FBI special agent and Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=0.0s)]
*  Nicole Parker and Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=5.4s)]
*  Friends, let's review for the audience something they already know. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=9.9s)]
*  These two figures, Jim Comey, former FBI director, and John Brennan, former CIA director, they [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=13.72s)]
*  had very prominent positions in the federal government, the security clearance, as the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=19.76s)]
*  access to sensitive information that goes along with it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=23.96s)]
*  Nicole, as a former FBI agent, tell us how the rank and file view people like Comey and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=27.52s)]
*  Brennan and the shenanigans, the outright lies and crimes that they have committed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=33.6s)]
*  Well first of all, I just have to say I am a native Texan and my heart goes out to all [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=39.76s)]
*  that have been negatively impacted by this awful tragedy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=43.44s)]
*  And God bless all of the first responders. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=46.58s)]
*  We are so grateful and I just have to say God bless Texas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  To your question, the rank and file at the FBI, those that are really doing the real [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  work at the FBI, they're absolutely disgusted by actions of Jim Comey. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=56.92s)]
*  What he stands for is exactly opposite of what you are trained to do when you are an [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  FBI special agent and an employee of the FBI. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=67.16s)]
*  And the number one response that I've received from those across the board, current and former [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  FBI employees, is quote, it's about time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=74.84s)]
*  This is something that FBI employees have wanted to see for a very long time because [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=79.2s)]
*  we believe in accountability. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  We are all about enforcing laws ourselves. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=85.68s)]
*  And when you have leadership at the top who does not even obey the rules, obey the procedures [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=88.2s)]
*  and policies and the laws, that is unacceptable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=92.92s)]
*  And I do believe that Jim Comey is the individual who single-handedly started the destruction [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=96.06s)]
*  of the FBI and the FBI has never recovered from his failures. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=101.72s)]
*  Yeah, Greg, I mean, you and I were on TV constantly about this ridiculous Russian hoax. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=105.68s)]
*  I was in the Trump White House. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  The amount of time that the networks and the two other cable stations spent on something [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  that never existed, that was fomented by Comey and pushed by Brennan, to say nothing of that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=118.0s)]
*  ridiculous Trump Tower meeting on January 6, 2017, where Comeyâ€”Brennan was there too, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=123.28s)]
*  but Comey ended up saying to President-elect Trump, hey, we don't know what this is all [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=131.8s)]
*  about, but there's some kind of golden shower, Russian asset thing, don't worry about it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=135.32s)]
*  And of course, we needed to worry about it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=140.0s)]
*  So why don't you bring us down a trip down memory lane and how we got to this point? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=142.08s)]
*  Do you think these guys will be charged with crimes? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=145.68s)]
*  I think there's a very good chance. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=148.56s)]
*  You know, I wrote two books about it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  And in the second book, I'm gratified to see that this new information from the CIA [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=153.96s)]
*  corroborates just about everything I wrote about John Brennan, that he knew that the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=160.12s)]
*  dossier was garbage. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=165.56s)]
*  And yet, he insisted on inserting it in the esteemed intelligence community assessment [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=168.08s)]
*  to give the dossier credibility so that he could use it as a cudgel to bludgeon Donald [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=175.28s)]
*  Trump politically. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=182.04s)]
*  What I think is really new is that these career CIA officials have come forward and they've [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=184.24s)]
*  whistle on John Brennan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=190.28s)]
*  Not just that he knew the dossier was junk, but literally the deputy director in writing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=193.24s)]
*  told him, you can't use this for the ICA. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=200.48s)]
*  It'll ruin the credibility of the intelligence community. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=204.8s)]
*  Brennan didn't care. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=208.56s)]
*  And you know, the CIA officials describe how he strong-armed everybody into putting the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=210.4s)]
*  dossier into that ICA. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=216.2s)]
*  He sidelined people who said no. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=219.64s)]
*  He silenced them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=222.72s)]
*  He excluded 13 intel agencies from contributing to it because they also objected. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=224.24s)]
*  So I think what they're looking at here with respect to Brennan is perjury, false statements, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=230.92s)]
*  maybe conspiracy along with Comey. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=238.84s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=241.72s)]
*  I mean, Greg, let me just stay with you for a moment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=243.44s)]
*  Legally speaking, where do we go from now? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=245.68s)]
*  So if they're under investigation, obviously they would need to be charged. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  If somebody will go in and maybe do an interview with them, possible indictments? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=251.88s)]
*  I mean, is it enough? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  The list I read, who can argue with this? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  Lying to Congress, abusing their security clearance, abusing the FISA process? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=259.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you'd have to go to a grand jury in Washington, D.C. and get an indictment [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  and then, of course, bring the prosecution in D.C. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=269.92s)]
*  Bringing a case against a Democrat and a liberal is almost a fool's errand. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=273.92s)]
*  As for James Comey, I think they're looking at defrauding the government, a conspiracy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=279.36s)]
*  and deprivation of rights under color of law. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=285.52s)]
*  That is, knowingly using fabricated false evidence to support a case against Donald [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=288.72s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=296.0s)]
*  Statute of limitations, which is five years or seven years, is actually suspended or [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=297.04s)]
*  told whenever incriminating evidence is deliberately withheld or fraudulently concealed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=303.84s)]
*  So I don't think the statute of limitations is a problem here because we're just now [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=311.64s)]
*  learning of some of the withheld, concealed evidence. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=316.2s)]
*  Yes, and Nicole, going back to you as an FBI agent, under Kash Patel, the FBI seems to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=322.0s)]
*  be going in an entirely different direction. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  What do you hear from some of your former colleagues about the different direction we [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  have now? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=334.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, going back to Jim Comey real fast, let's just remind the American [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=335.0s)]
*  viewer that he was very famous for always saying, no one is above the law. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  And you know what, Jim Comey, you're right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=344.76s)]
*  No one is above the law, including yourself. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=346.44s)]
*  And I can tell you that there is a spike in morale at the FBI. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=349.04s)]
*  Kellyanne, I walked away from the agency because it turned into something I no longer even [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=352.96s)]
*  recognized. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=357.44s)]
*  And I can tell you that I started first noticing the politicization of the FBI with Jim Comey [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=358.56s)]
*  on July 5th of 2016, about nine years ago, actually, where he came out and said no reasonable [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=363.36s)]
*  prosecutor would charge Hillary Clinton. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=368.88s)]
*  And under the new leadership of FBI Director Kash Patel, that's not how the FBI works anymore. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=371.32s)]
*  Kash Patel looks at the evidence and they say, you know what, is there something here [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=375.8s)]
*  or is there not? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=380.8s)]
*  It's not based on politics. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=381.8s)]
*  It's based on facts. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  It is based on evidence. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  But I can tell you, FBI agents, what they want to do is get back to enforcing the law. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=385.8s)]
*  They want to be out of politics. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=390.0s)]
*  But most of all, they want accountability and consequences for those that are breaking [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=391.6s)]
*  the law. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=396.1s)]
*  And that is what FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino are all about [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=397.1s)]
*  and Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=402.72s)]
*  And so I can tell you that the morale has increased greatly. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  They've got a lot on their plate. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=408.18s)]
*  They have walked into an absolute disaster zone. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=409.42s)]
*  But there are good, amazing FBI special agents and staff at the FBI who have always done [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=412.04s)]
*  incredible work and they deserve accolades. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=417.90000000000003s)]
*  They have quietly worked behind the scenes while all this nonsense was going on, and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=420.7s)]
*  they have worked hard and they have worked diligently. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  And what they want more than anything is those that have politicized the agency to be held [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=426.98s)]
*  accountable. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=431.38s)]
*  No, it's so true because Comey and his book and Brennan on TV constantly, they lied in [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=433.02s)]
*  both places. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=438.14s)]
*  But lying under oath to Congress and abusing the FISA process and your security clearance, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=439.14s)]
*  these are potentially criminal indictments that we can see coming. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=443.98s)]
*  We're going to keep a close eye on this and I know we'll have you back. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=448.9s)]
*  Nicole Parker, Greg Jarrett, thank you so much. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=451.46s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCRbEtQ4DU&t=462.38s)]
