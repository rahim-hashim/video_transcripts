# 'UNTHINKABLE ODDS': Eric Trump says family stood 'shoulder-to-shoulder' for 10 years
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s)
*  All right, 10 years ago today, the most powerful movement in modern political history was born. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=0.0s)]
*  That was when President Trump descended down the escalator at Trump Tower. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=8.78s)]
*  The course of this great nation's history has now changed forever. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=13.38s)]
*  The MAGA movement swept across the country and has been the driving force of American [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=16.68s)]
*  politics ever since. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=21.72s)]
*  But for the last 10 years, the left has shown again and again and again they do not understand, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=23.46s)]
*  nor do they care to understand, nor will they ever understand what Donald Trump is about, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=29.44s)]
*  the movement is about. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=35.2s)]
*  Instead of trying to figure out, you know, why tens of millions of Americans wholeheartedly, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=36.56s)]
*  passionately support him, they will spend their time whining, lying, weaponizing, rioting. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=42.0s)]
*  Just take a look at some of their pathetic so-called protests from over this past weekend. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=53.52s)]
*  Them kidnapping our family members, them ignoring Supreme Court decisions, them going around [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=54.6s)]
*  Congress to go to war, all of these fascist, unconstitutional, unlawful decisions, only [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=62.52s)]
*  can be fought when we resist in the streets. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=71.04s)]
*  We accomplish still, drops of water turn the mill, singly none. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=73.64s)]
*  Tell your son, tell your son, tell your son, let them go. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=81.2s)]
*  Don't let this administration normalize what is happening. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=87.2s)]
*  It is not normal. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=92.52s)]
*  Woooooooooo! [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  One more time, one more time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=100.16s)]
*  Woooooo! [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=103.56s)]
*  One more time, one more time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=106.2s)]
*  Endless meltdowns, calls for political violence are only strengthening the MAGA movement. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=109.64s)]
*  In contrast, while the left was having a collective breakdown on Saturday, President Trump, he [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=115.08s)]
*  was honoring the U.S. Army on its 250th birthday with a parade in D.C., second to none, showcasing, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=119.76s)]
*  celebrating 250 years of the best, the bravest among us, an amazing night, but showing once [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=127.8s)]
*  again that there is no stoop too low for the left. The left attacked the celebration and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=134.14s)]
*  failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Tonight is facing a major backlash after her [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=140.22s)]
*  comments celebrating the left's protests while degrading the military parade and she was [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=144.94s)]
*  not alone. Take a look at some of the members of the legacy media mob that are officially [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=150.18s)]
*  dead, gone and buried. Rest in peace. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=155.42s)]
*  The optics at issue two, foreign American democracy. Military pageantry like this, typically [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=158.54s)]
*  seen in places like North Korea and Russia. That point about props or sort of personalization, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=164.78s)]
*  people, political scientists, comparatists, particularly we'll talk about personalist [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=171.78s)]
*  dictatorships, right? These are sort of forms of authoritarian government, very engineered [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=175.82s)]
*  around the personality of the strongman. One thing I will say, I want to go back to you, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=181.18s)]
*  Eric, that again, when we talk about the sort of tension in the country and sometimes, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=187.3s)]
*  you know, you and I have both been at Trump rallies, those can be, you know, very tense, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=192.38000000000002s)]
*  a kind of, I would say like kind of a dark level in energy sometimes in them. Not always. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=197.3s)]
*  All right, here with reaction from the Trump organization, Eric Trump. I got your text, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  by the way. You suck me back into politics. I love politics. And by the way, it's been [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=207.58s)]
*  10 years of non-unrelenting attacks. It's been against you. It's been against your [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=214.06s)]
*  brothers, your sisters. It's been against your father, your entire family, Melania. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=219.82s)]
*  It just never ends. And at a level that I've never seen before, you're running a business. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=224.74s)]
*  Do you remember that when I first started interviewing your dad at Trump Tower, you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=229.58s)]
*  were a little, you were a lot younger then. And I'd go there and he'd always take the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=233.54s)]
*  time to introduce me to you and Don and Ivanka, and you were there working and you were doing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=238.38s)]
*  business deals. Today you announced a really cool business deal. That's what you do for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=243.46s)]
*  a living. You have done this for decades in your life. And of course you get attacked [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=247.62s)]
*  for doing what you're allowed to do, even if your father is president. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=252.9s)]
*  Of course, Sean, but honestly, my greatest honor of my life was riding down that escalator [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=260.26s)]
*  with my father. I was being there by his side every single day for those 10 years. We got [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=264.1s)]
*  the hell a beat out of us. You know it, between the impeachments, between the Russia hoax, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=268.1s)]
*  the dirty dossiers, the stripping our first amendment rights, the taking us off of social [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=271.86s)]
*  media platforms, the raiding our homes, the coming after us by AGs and DAs all over the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=276.7s)]
*  country. I mean, they did everything they could to absolutely destroy us. They wanted [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=282.3s)]
*  to put my father in jail. They would have put all of us in jail. They wanted to do everything [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=287.26s)]
*  they could to ruin his life, to ruin his family, to ruin all his accomplishments, to take away [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=290.66s)]
*  his voice. And yet, you know, every single day we fought. And because of incredible people [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=297.46s)]
*  like you, I can't tell you how many times I've come on the show. And as a family, we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=301.82s)]
*  stood shoulder to shoulder and we fought. And you have the most dynamic guy in American [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=305.34s)]
*  history. You have a person who absolutely loves our nation. And he fought like hell. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=309.29999999999995s)]
*  And he won. And he's back in the driver's seat against unthinkable odds, Sean. And it's [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  hard to believe all of that was accomplished in a 10-year period of time. The guy's a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=318.9s)]
*  miraculous guy. And it's a, what a hell of a journey this whole thing has been. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=323.18s)]
*  You know, I'm watching how your president, how your father, the president, is trying [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=327.22s)]
*  to bring about world peace. You know, Donald Trump has gone above and beyond as it relates [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=332.74s)]
*  to Europe and the Middle East, and in this case with the mullahs in Iran, pretty much [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=338.98s)]
*  all but begging them, you're not going to have nuclear weapons, but you can have a country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=343.86s)]
*  And of course, they don't listen. And then people say, well, that's not part of the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=349.42s)]
*  Trump doctrine. I'm like, Donald Trump wrote the doctrine. It's his MAGA movement. It's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  his America First movement. And for people to think they know more about the America [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=358.1s)]
*  First movement is kind of comical to me. It is. And for some reason, people don't want [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  to listen. All right. I mean, my father's been always very direct. I don't want to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=369.1s)]
*  go to war. I want peace on earth. I'm sick and tired of seeing these young men and women [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=372.22s)]
*  all over the world, innocent civilians. I'm sick and tired of seeing them die. But at [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=377.14000000000004s)]
*  the same time, we're going to have the greatest, strongest military on earth. And Sean, if [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=380.78000000000003s)]
*  we ever have to use it, we're going to knock the hell out of them. It will be so decisive. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=384.98s)]
*  It will be over so quickly. I really wish people on the other side of the world were [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=389.3s)]
*  listening to those comments. And he's been saying this for a decade, Sean. He's been [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  saying it for a decade. I do not want to go to war. He's been saying it all week. I do [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=396.66s)]
*  not want to go to war. But if I have to, I'm going to knock somebody's head off. And my [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  father does want peace. He was so against Afghanistan. He was so against Iraq. He was [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=404.82s)]
*  so against these endless 20-year battles where you lose thousands and thousands and thousands [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=409.02s)]
*  of incredible young people at the same time spending trillions of dollars, which could [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=414.86s)]
*  otherwise be invested in our schools and our infrastructure and our country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=418.82s)]
*  But at the same time, he wants the strongest military, where if he actually has to use [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  it to prevent a country from getting unthinkable weaponry, which will get used against us, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=425.86s)]
*  which will get used against Israel and other places, believe me, he'll certainly do it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=430.53999999999996s)]
*  But for some reason, they wanted to ignore him. Iran didn't want to listen, right? He [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=434.62s)]
*  said, you have 60 days. He didn't say you have 61 days. He said, you have 60 days. And [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=438.78000000000003s)]
*  then something really bad is going to happen. And that's exactly what happened. I wish people [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=443.62s)]
*  would listen. My father's a man of his word. He's here to protect the United States of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=446.7s)]
*  America. He's always here to put America first. And he's, I think, doing just that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=450.38s)]
*  Listen, talking about the number one state sponsor, terror, when I think of what Israel [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=454.98s)]
*  has had to endure with, you know, over the years, and I've been there many times, one [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=461.14s)]
*  little small town in 10 years had 10,000 rockets fired into it. You know, how many rockets [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=465.74s)]
*  would it take, do you think, if your father was president? And would it take if a foreign [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=471.14s)]
*  entity that chanted death to America, if they fired one rocket, do you think your father [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=476.94s)]
*  would respond immediately? Because I suspect he probably would. And he would respond with [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=482.34s)]
*  overwhelming force, knock out the threat, and then hopefully negotiate a peace on the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=487.22s)]
*  other side of it. Am I wrong in my thinking? Is that not the Trump doctrine? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=492.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you better believe it. If Mexico, let's just say that was a scenario, fired rockets [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=496.26000000000005s)]
*  in the United States, I think they'd be decapitated in about, you know, four seconds flat. Of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=503.26000000000005s)]
*  course, America wouldn't stand for that. Not a single American would stand for that. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=507.42s)]
*  No American leader would stand for that. My father certainly wouldn't stand for that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=510.22s)]
*  And I think it's a great parallel to exactly what's happening right now. But, you know, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ5vUSh5m9s&t=513.1s)]
