# Hannity: Trump's 'spine of steel' strategy is paying off
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY)
*  And welcome to Hannity and tonight we are back in the DC Swamp broadcasting live from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=0.0s)]
*  inside the U.S. Capitol building where in just a moment we're going to be joined by [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Kennedy, Senator Britt, Senator Graham, Senator [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=11.24s)]
*  Scott, Senator Markway Mullen, the Majority Leader himself, John Thune for a very special [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Senate town hall. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=22.6s)]
*  And we begin tonight with one word. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=24.0s)]
*  Maybe you've heard of it, maybe you haven't, reconciliation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=26.88s)]
*  I'm going to spare you the boring, gritty details of what is a rather arcane, budgetary, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=29.96s)]
*  but really, really important procedure. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=36.24s)]
*  But just know that the senators here in this room can in fact pass certain spending and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=38.8s)]
*  revenue bills with a simple 51-vote majority. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=45.0s)]
*  No filibuster proof supermajority is needed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  Now this could play a significant role in giving Tom Homan the tools that he would need [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  to secure our border. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  That would mean new miles of border wall. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=58.04s)]
*  That would mean expanded ICE capabilities, additional border patrol agents, the ability [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=60.96s)]
*  to expedite deportations on a large scale. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=65.76s)]
*  You know, we have known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel members and gang members in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=69.48s)]
*  our country that need to be sent home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=74.22s)]
*  This could also be used to make President Trump's tax cuts permanent. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=77.2s)]
*  Otherwise, it's going to be a $4 trillion tax increase on you, the American people. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=81.12s)]
*  He can also implement no tax on tips or overtime or Social Security and even implement certain [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=86.44s)]
*  changes recommended by Doge. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=93.44s)]
*  That will eliminate hundreds of billions of waste, fraud, abuse and corruption inside [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=96.08s)]
*  of our federal government. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=101.2s)]
*  And of course, reconciliation might ultimately play a role in President Trump's reciprocal [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=102.86s)]
*  tariff strategy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  There is a little disagreement on that issue tonight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=109.8s)]
*  We'll get into it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, tonight, for the first time in decades, we do have a president that is willing and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=114.04s)]
*  ready and able to stand up for American industry, for the working men and women that truly do [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=117.92s)]
*  make our country great and our interests around the globe. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  No amount of hysteria, no amount of fear mongering is going to shake the president's resolve. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  As Caroline Levitt very articulately mentioned today, President Trump does have a spine of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=133.54000000000002s)]
*  steel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=139.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=140.52s)]
*  On the other hand, countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate and try to double [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=141.64s)]
*  down on their mistreatment of American workers, are making a mistake. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=145.64s)]
*  President Trump has a spine of steel and he will not break and America will not break [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=149.72s)]
*  under his leadership. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=154.04s)]
*  He is guided by a firm belief that America must be able to produce essential goods for [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  our own people and export them to the rest of the world. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=160.0s)]
*  Now, tonight, President Trump's strategy seems to be paying off. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  Around 70 countries are in talks with the White House to reduce or eliminate tariffs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=168.84s)]
*  against American goods. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=173.88s)]
*  So far, Israel, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Taiwan, they have all vowed to end all tariffs against [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=175.66s)]
*  American-made goods. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=182.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the European Union, they have now offered to remove all industrial tariffs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=183.72s)]
*  Britain's prime minister publicly admitting that globalization is over and now working [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=189.0s)]
*  with the White House on a bilateral free and fair trade deal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=194.44s)]
*  Also, Japan, South Korea, they are already sending a team to Washington, D.C., right [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=199.44s)]
*  here, to hammer out their own deal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=204.11999999999998s)]
*  American products are about to get even more competitive on the world stage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=207.44s)]
*  And while major multinational companies like Nissan and Honda and Apple, along with so [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=212.0s)]
*  many other countries and companies, they're now pledging, as of now, to invest already [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=217.1s)]
*  $7 trillion in manufacturing plants and other businesses and ventures right here in the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=224.4s)]
*  U.S. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, this is what it looks like when you do have a president who, number one, keeps his [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  promises, is willing to fight, but, of course, not everybody's happy, especially the communist [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=235.56s)]
*  Chinese. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  They're not happy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  For decades, they have benefited from a massive trade imbalance with the U.S. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  They have been hostile to our friends and allies around the world. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=247.32s)]
*  They have stolen untold hundreds of billions of dollars in intellectual property theft, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=251.0s)]
*  and they are also the most guilty of currency manipulation, high tariffs on U.S. goods. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=256.88s)]
*  And our partnership with China has been a one-way street. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=263.36s)]
*  The president, he has sent a very clear, unambiguous message. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=266.68s)]
*  This is going to end. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=270.86s)]
*  We send them trillions of dollars. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=272.44s)]
*  They send us a lot of junk, often made in sweatshops. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=274.28s)]
*  And let's not forget about COVID-19, shall we? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=277.88s)]
*  Now, they're retaliatory tariffs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=280.6s)]
*  They are hollow in every way. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=282.52s)]
*  China, like the rest of the world—and we need to all understand this—they desperately [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=284.96s)]
*  want and need access to American markets. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=288.92s)]
*  They want your money. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=292.72s)]
*  The most—most American goods have already been blocked in some way from getting into [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=294.16s)]
*  China, but the 104 percent tariff that Donald Trump will impose at midnight tonight, well, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=298.96s)]
*  that could wreck China's already fragile economy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=304.76s)]
*  The president knows leverage, but will he get the backing? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=307.44s)]
*  Will he get the support of the U.S. Senate? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=311.28s)]
*  Will he get the 51 votes needed for reconciliation? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=313.48s)]
*  It's obviously easier said than done, especially—there are senators, I won't mention names, that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=316.68s)]
*  kind of have contempt for President Trump. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=322.56s)]
*  They want to be opposition voices, and they don't really understand how profound and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=324.48s)]
*  deep this moment is. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=329.42s)]
*  Anyway, we'll see over time what happens with some of these other senators. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=331.08s)]
*  So the road ahead is not going to be easy, but so far, Senate leadership, they have done [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=335.76s)]
*  an amazing job. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  They have stuck together. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=341.64s)]
*  They have navigated challenge after challenge. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=342.88s)]
*  They got the president's cabinet through. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wHwZeyjhY&t=345.59999999999997s)]
