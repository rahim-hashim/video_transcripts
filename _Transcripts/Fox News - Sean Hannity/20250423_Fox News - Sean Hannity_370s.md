# Rep. Byron Donalds shuts down heckler at town hall: ‘DISRESPECTFUL’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI)
*  Now, one of the left's new favorite talking points is Republican members of Congress are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=0.0s)]
*  afraid to hold town halls. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=4.88s)]
*  Of course, that is not accurate. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=7.0s)]
*  The left knows it's not accurate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=9.16s)]
*  We do know that there have been multiple reports of Democratic groups that are well-funded [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=11.0s)]
*  and provide talking points that have purposely been organizing disruptions of Republican [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=16.8s)]
*  town halls. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=22.16s)]
*  Chuck Schumer himself said the Democratic Party had people dedicated to this effort. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=23.16s)]
*  The goal of these radical Democrats, whether organized or not, is to show up, make a scene, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=28.16s)]
*  cause chaos, create a false image that, oh, everybody's angry with Republicans. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=33.24s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened yesterday to Florida Congressman Byron Donnells. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=38.6s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=42.8s)]
*  You are made in a better place than the lives of hundreds of our children. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=44.44s)]
*  And Palestine comes to die. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  We are not Hamas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  We are not. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  The Palestinians have voted for Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  They have not done anything to remove Hamas. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  So if you want to have a shouting natural, please, let's have a shouting natural, because [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  you think you're being heard, and let's be clear, you're not. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=64.88s)]
*  You're not. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=66.88s)]
*  Look at the way it's dealt with now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=67.88s)]
*  If you're being disrespectful, you am, you are being disrespectful. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=68.88s)]
*  I will respect you, and I will honor the fact that you are here trying to get answers, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=72.96s)]
*  but if you're going to hold this enough and be disrespectful, then that's not going to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=76.96s)]
*  be the rules. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=80.96s)]
*  You can get a match, and I'll let you in. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=81.96s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=83.96s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=85.96s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=87.96s)]
*  Free, free Palestine! [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=89.96s)]
*  All right, here with reaction, Congressman Byron Donnells. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=93.96s)]
*  First, I give you a lot of credit for dealing and putting you up with this crap. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=95.96s)]
*  Free, free Palestine. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=98.96s)]
*  Okay, radical leftists. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=99.96s)]
*  Maybe they should think about murder, kidnapping, torture, beheadings that took place, the equivalent [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  of 40,000 dead Israelis, based on their population size versus ours in a single day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Maybe they would be a little more sympathetic to the victims of Islamic terror. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Sean, my reaction is simple. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  We were going to do town hall meetings because I believe that's what members of Congress [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  should be doing, regardless of people who want to come in, try to take over town halls, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=128.12s)]
*  booze or boo or whatever they want to do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=133.12s)]
*  The other point, Sean, is this is why Donald Trump supports me to be Florida's next governor, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=135.12s)]
*  because I will take the message of common sense and conservatism anywhere, anyplace, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=139.12s)]
*  any time, in any audience. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=144.12s)]
*  I'm not going to be intimidated by any of these protesters. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=146.12s)]
*  Members of Congress should not be intimidated by these people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=149.12s)]
*  They want to shout you down to try to deflect and distract from their terrible policies [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=152.12s)]
*  and how they left America really at the bottom in the pit because of the terrible presidency [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  of Joe Biden. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  We shouldn't put up with it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  We should confront it head on. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  And if they're going to be rude and disrespectful, then kick them out of the room. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  You heard what Chuck Schumer had said about this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  And there's been a lot written about whether this is astroturfing and people are organized, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  given talking points, purposely showing up, even people from outside your district. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  Did you get the impression that was the case last night? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, last night, I know because we were making sure that only members of the Congressional [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=186.28s)]
*  District could attend that these were local Democrats. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=191.28s)]
*  They wanted to be inflamed. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=194.28s)]
*  I will say, yeah, local Democrats are being organized about coming into congressional [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=195.28s)]
*  town halls. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=200.28s)]
*  I've had town halls for years, Sean, never saw that many Democrats show up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=201.28s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=205.28s)]
*  If they want to show up now, you're going to hear the truth. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=206.28s)]
*  You're going to hear the facts. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=209.28s)]
*  You're not going to hear Democrat talking points. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=210.28s)]
*  You're not going to hear spin. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=213.28s)]
*  And they want to yell and be upset because they want you, quite frankly, to reverse course, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=214.36s)]
*  reverse your positions, stand against things that are right, stand against deporting illegal [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=219.36s)]
*  aliens, stand against Israel. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=225.36s)]
*  That's what they want you to do. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=227.36s)]
*  But when you don't bend to their will, then they yell and they get upset like they did [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=229.36s)]
*  last night. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=232.36s)]
*  So if they want to organize and come to town halls, that's fine. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=233.36s)]
*  But you will be met with the facts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=236.36s)]
*  You will be met with reality. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=238.36s)]
*  You'll be met with common sense. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=240.36s)]
*  That's what they want you to do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=242.36s)]
*  That's common sense. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  That's what Republicans need to be doing right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=244.44000000000003s)]
*  Look, I love the fact that you know you're walking into an environment that this is likely [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=246.44000000000003s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=251.44000000000003s)]
*  And maybe there are a lot of Republicans that just don't want any part of it and they'll [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=252.44000000000003s)]
*  stay away from it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=256.44s)]
*  But I do suggest that people do what you did. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=257.44s)]
*  And this is a basic security measure. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=260.44s)]
*  You were kind of on a stage that they couldn't get to you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=263.44s)]
*  I'm sure you had security nearby. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=266.44s)]
*  And just for your safety and having people there for the safety of the crowds as well. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=268.44s)]
*  But it was obvious also the majority of the people there wanted to hear from you and did [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=272.52s)]
*  not like the disruption. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=279.52s)]
*  That part never gets played out in the media. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=281.52s)]
*  They only show the part where they're disrupting your speech. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=283.52s)]
*  Now that's very true, Sean. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=288.52s)]
*  And listen, even last night when people wanted to jeer and boo, I told them, I'm like, you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=290.52s)]
*  don't have to agree with me, but at least respect the venue and respect other members [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=294.96s)]
*  of the constituency to hear the answer. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=300.56s)]
*  You can boo later. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=303.56s)]
*  You can leave and be upset, but at least give people the opportunity to hear, be respectful. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=304.56s)]
*  And when it came time when people were choosing not to be respectful, that's when we kicked [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=309.56s)]
*  them out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=313.52s)]
*  And we were very clear at the top. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=314.52s)]
*  If you're not respectful of the environment that we're in and let people actually hear [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=315.52s)]
*  what's going on, we're going to remove you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=320.08s)]
*  And I think that's a common sense approach to it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=322.44s)]
*  You want to be able to address the constituency that you represent in a personal, one-on-one [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  manner. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  You want to be able to do that, I believe, as a member of Congress. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  But we've got to set ground rules. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=334.24s)]
*  If you want to be upset, be upset. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  But that doesn't give people the right to be disrespectful. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=337.62s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  If you're going to disrupt everyone else's town hall, you're out. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  Goodbye. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't let the door kick in the backside on the way out. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  Congressman, appreciate you coming on. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Glad everything worked out okay. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=350.88s)]
*  And it was clear that the vast majority of people there were there to hear you and ask [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=352.56s)]
*  important questions. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXVJDDZS3RI&t=356.52s)]
