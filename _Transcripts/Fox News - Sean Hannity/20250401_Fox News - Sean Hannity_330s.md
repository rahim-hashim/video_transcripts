# Treasury sec: Trump’s doing things people have been talking about for 30 years
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA)
*  Joining us now with reaction, Treasury Secretary Scott Bissent is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=0.0s)]
*  Scott, I won't mention everything, but if you look at $1.4 trillion in investments from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=5.0s)]
*  the UAE and another trillion from Saudi Arabia and $500 billion from Apple over four years [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=10.84s)]
*  and $681 million for EV production, Nissan and Honda, they were going to build plants [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=17.36s)]
*  in Mexico, now they're going to build them here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=24.18s)]
*  Then of course you have $100 billion in new domestic chip production, $100 billion from [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=27.08s)]
*  a Taiwanese semiconductor company, and I'm scrolling the rest of them, and you tell me [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=31.24s)]
*  how even the talk of tariffs is not a good thing and has not paid off already for the country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=37.0s)]
*  You know, Sean, since President Trump came in on January 20th, there's just been a line [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=45.4s)]
*  through the Oval Office of the countries and companies who want to bring capital, jobs [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=53.08s)]
*  and factories to the United States, and we are going to accommodate that through great [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=60.6s)]
*  regulation, low taxes, energy dominance, and President Trump is attracting them back through [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  the tariff plan and insisting on fair trade for the American people, something that he's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=76.16s)]
*  been talking about for the past 30 or 40 years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=82.22s)]
*  Okay, so it's basically we agree to free and fair trade, and if you're going to put [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=85.82s)]
*  unfair tariffs on us, there's going to be reciprocal tariffs in exchange. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=91.34s)]
*  Okay, that sounds fair to me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=96.3s)]
*  Why would people have a problem with that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=98.7s)]
*  Why would the markets become skittish over the quote, uncertainty over what tariffs will [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=100.24s)]
*  remain or leave? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=104.9s)]
*  You can see at the last minute countries like India are like, okay, I'm ready to make a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=106.3s)]
*  deal now, the same with Great Britain and the same with other European countries. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=110.12s)]
*  I'm ready to talk now because the deadline is coming. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  Yep, Sean, so April 2nd, we are going to disclose the reciprocal tariffs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=117.4s)]
*  I'm not going to get out ahead of President Trump. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=127.0s)]
*  He's going to announce them three o'clock on Wednesday, and I think for the first time [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  in decades, probably since I was a college student, we're going to see fair trade, and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=136.52s)]
*  everyone will have the opportunity to lower their tariffs, lower their non-tariff barriers, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=142.94s)]
*  stop the currency manipulation, stop subsidizing labor, stop subsidizing, stop providing cheap [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=151.0s)]
*  loans and make the global trading system fair for American workers again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=158.76s)]
*  And if President Trump campaigned on this, he has a mandate, as you know, he had a substantial [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=168.17999999999998s)]
*  Electoral College majority, he won all seven swing states, and he won the popular vote. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=174.28s)]
*  So he has a mandate to do this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  He's doing what he promised he would do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=182.64s)]
*  He's bringing jobs home. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=185.44s)]
*  So he wants to make his tax cuts permanent, which I agree with. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=187.68s)]
*  He wants no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, and nor will he [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  touch Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, except to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=198.72s)]
*  which is a very different scenario. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=204.44s)]
*  Okay, with all of that said, I've always believed as a conservative and as a supply [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=206.16s)]
*  cider that a rising tide lifts all votes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=212.64s)]
*  Reagan, by cutting taxes, literally doubled revenues in eight years to the federal government [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=215.48s)]
*  and created 22 million jobs. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=221.32s)]
*  In the first three years of the Trump administration, his tax cuts resulted in the lowest unemployment [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=222.88s)]
*  rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=228.18s)]
*  African American youth unemployment. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=234.04s)]
*  Why would we expect a different result when it's worked every time in my adult lifetime? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=236.32s)]
*  Well, because the Democrats don't want to admit that it worked. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=240.88000000000002s)]
*  And what we saw in President Trump's term was not only fantastic job growth, but fantastic [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=246.52s)]
*  wage growth for all the groups you just named. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=252.68s)]
*  Working Americans did fantastic under President Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=256.64s)]
*  Hourly workers did better than supervisory workers. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=261.68s)]
*  The low income households saw a higher increase in their household net worth than the top [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=266.44s)]
*  10 percent. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=272.56s)]
*  For the past four years, these folks have been getting killed. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=273.56s)]
*  The bottom 50 percent has been eviscerated by high inflation, unfettered immigration, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=278.0s)]
*  suppressing wages, and that's going to come to an end. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=285.72s)]
*  We are going to make the tax cuts or the 2017 tax cuts and job deck, we're going to make [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=289.68s)]
*  it permanent, and then we're going to layer on President Trump's campaign promises, no [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=299.0s)]
*  tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and we're going to make purchasing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=305.12s)]
*  an American car tax deductible again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=312.64s)]
*  All right, Scott Bissett, appreciate it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJhAl1BYBoA&t=315.44s)]
