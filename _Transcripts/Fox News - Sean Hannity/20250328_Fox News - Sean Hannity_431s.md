# Dems stand for violence: Ted Cruz
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0)
*  As big moves are happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Democratic Party is in shambles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=0.0s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, a quote populist uprising is underway as attendees [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=5.68s)]
*  at recent Democratic events. So these are Democrats used words like weak and lame to describe their [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=12.8s)]
*  own party. Ooh, that's harsh. With some even floating wild theories about a military coup. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=20.72s)]
*  And now even some elected Democrats appear to be using violent rhetoric. This week, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=26.48s)]
*  the Left's rising star Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett called for Senator Ted Cruz to be knocked [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=32.32s)]
*  over the head. But like it's Ted Cruz. I mean, like this dude has to be knocked over the head, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  like hard, right? Like there is no niceties with him. Like at all. Like you, you go clean off on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=46.64s)]
*  him, right? Here now to respond, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Cruz, how do you respond to a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=52.96s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman suggesting you should be knocked over the head? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Look, I don't know her. She's she's a congresswoman from Dallas. I've never met her. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=67.12s)]
*  As far as I can tell, she's never done anything in the House of Representatives, other than than [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=72.08s)]
*  scream obscenities. But but I'll say it's sad. It's really sad that this is where the Democrat [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=76.56s)]
*  Party is. You know, you were talking a minute ago in your last segment about how the Democrat Party, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=82.56s)]
*  they're floundering, that they don't stand for anything other than rage and hatred. They hate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=88.0s)]
*  Donald Trump. They hate Elon Musk. They're now the party of violence. She's happily calling for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=94.88s)]
*  violence. You know what? We see death threats across the board. By the way, Donald Trump had [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=101.28s)]
*  two assassination attempts. And that kind of rhetoric is it plays into it. You know, this, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=106.96s)]
*  it is unfortunate to see the rage we're seeing right now, domestic terrorism directed at Tesla [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  dealerships with with radical leftists coming in with Molotov cocktails, bombs, we had bombs in an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Austin Tesla dealership, firing guns, somebody's gonna get killed. And at some point, the Democrat [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  Party needs to stop being out of their minds. Like when I was first elected 13 years ago to the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=134.48s)]
*  Senate, there was such a thing as moderate Democrats, they're not anymore. They now just [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=141.44s)]
*  are the party of rage and hatred and extremism. And and and that's an unfortunate thing for our [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  country. Senator Cruz, I'm hoping you can straighten something out for me, because I have so many [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  Democrats who say to me, look, there's all this rage at Republican town halls. That was the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=158.88s)]
*  talking point, the viral talking point. But then, you know, I read the Washington Post and Democratic [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=164.08s)]
*  voters are calling their own party lame. I've seen soundbites of people screaming down Democratic [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  members like Glenn Ivy. It seems like the rage is from the Democratic Party at their town halls. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=174.24s)]
*  What are you seeing? Well, listen, I think the quote rage at Republican town halls was entirely [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=181.12s)]
*  astroturf. We saw the left paying and hiring left-wing activists to show up at town halls. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=188.4s)]
*  George Soros, there's a whole apparatus where they fund. I'll tell you something, Kayleigh. So last [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=194.8s)]
*  year for about seven months, I had every Saturday morning at 7am pro-Hamas protesters in front of my [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=200.56s)]
*  house. They would show up at 7am. They would scream at the top of their lungs. They would [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  bang bells. They would scream curse words. They'd drop F bombs. They'd wake up the small children [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=213.84s)]
*  who live in the houses nearby me. And what was interesting is they would show up at 7am [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  and they'd leave at 8. It was clearly paid for. They were being paid. As far as I can tell, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=228.08s)]
*  these protesters were not Palestinian. They were just leftists who were getting a paycheck. 7am [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=233.76s)]
*  they were there. 8 o'clock, 8.01 they were gone. And it went for about seven months and then it [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=238.4s)]
*  disappeared. They'd never come back. And it was clear whoever was writing the paycheck, at some [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=244.4s)]
*  point they decided, all right, we've harassed my family long enough. Let's go harass someone else. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=248.56s)]
*  It was entirely fake. It was paid for. And so when I look at these town halls, I think the people [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  showing up are leftists who are getting a paycheck, who are trying to create the corporate media is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=260.24s)]
*  more than happy to be complicit and say, oh, voters are mad. I'll tell you, when I'm home in Texas, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=266.64s)]
*  Texans are thrilled. We're thrilled the border is being secured. A 98% drop in illegal immigration. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  We're thrilled the president is standing up to our enemies. We're thrilled that the war on Texas [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=278.64s)]
*  energy and American oil and gas has ended. We're thrilled. I got to tell you, in my whole life, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=285.12s)]
*  I've never seen a president hit the ground running the way Donald Trump has. And it is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=291.36s)]
*  extraordinary. And what I'm hearing from Texans is a lot of gratitude. You know, last week on my [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=296.8s)]
*  podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz, I interviewed Elon Musk. I did an hour long one on one interview. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=303.92s)]
*  And one of the things I conveyed to him is I said, Elon, before I did this interview, I tweeted out, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  hey, if you could have a beer with Elon, what would you say to him? The most frequent comment [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=313.92s)]
*  I had, and I passed this on to Elon, was Texans and Americans saying thank you. Thank you for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=318.32s)]
*  enduring the vilification, the demonization. Thank you for standing up and fighting alongside [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=323.68s)]
*  President Trump to save this country. That's what I'm hearing. You know, I only have a few moments, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=328.88s)]
*  Senator Cruz, but I do want to ask you about a cryptocurrency bill you have passed the Senate [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=335.52s)]
*  should be going to President Trump's desk. And it's rolling back the abusive regulations [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=340.32s)]
*  of President Biden. Is that right? That's exactly right. The Biden administration in the closing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=345.04s)]
*  days of the administration put in place an IRS rule attacking cryptocurrency, attacking [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=351.68s)]
*  decentralized finance and treating those engaged in decentralized finance as broker dealers. It [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=357.44s)]
*  would have put an enormous amount of people in the crypto world out of business. It was wrong. So I [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=363.68s)]
*  introduced a resolution to repeal it. We brought it up for a vote on the floor of the Senate and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=368.88s)]
*  we got a massive bipartisan vote. We got about 70 votes for repealing that rule. It is the single [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=373.28s)]
*  largest vote in history for a, for a, a, a repeal of a regulation. And, and listen, one of the big [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=380.23999999999995s)]
*  issues in this last election was Bitcoin and crypto. I am the leading defender of Bitcoin and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=389.76s)]
*  the leading defender of crypto in the United States Senate. And the left hates Bitcoin and crypto. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren hates Bitcoin and crypto for the same reason communist China does, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=400.32s)]
*  because government can't control it. And Kelly, that's why I love it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=405.28s)]
*  Man, 70 votes. So there are a few Democrats who believe in the free market, at least for crypto. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=410.8s)]
*  Well, that's encouraging. Senator Ted Cruz. Thank you. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwLigUA75j0&t=415.44s)]
