# Leavitt reveals status of Trump-Musk relationship after public feud
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg)
*  Here with reaction, it's time for our White House briefing with the White House press [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=0.0s)]
*  secretary, Caroline Levitt. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=5.48s)]
*  You know, I shouldn't admit all this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  There's a part of me—I grew up playing hockey, and there wasn't a single day that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=9.76s)]
*  we played hockey or basketball or football or baseball, whatever we were playing, where [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=14.76s)]
*  we didn't fight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  And then we'd fight, then we'd become friends again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=20.0s)]
*  When you're dealing with two very powerful men, and a week—less than a week ago, they [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=23.82s)]
*  were best friends—got personal very quick. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=27.76s)]
*  But really what we're dealing with here, from my point of view, is just a major policy [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=31.6s)]
*  difference, which they acknowledged in that very friendly press conference. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  That's right, Sean. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=42.32s)]
*  And tonight, the president's focus, and the focus of the entire White House, remains [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=45.28s)]
*  on passing the one big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=49.1s)]
*  And as your audience just saw, on Friday, just days ago, the president graciously hosted [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Elon Musk in the Oval Office, and Elon thanked the president for his incredible leadership [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=56.84s)]
*  to cut waste, fraud and abuse in our government, which this one big, beautiful bill does. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  So the only difference between Friday and today is Elon went back to his companies, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  and as a businessman, he has a right to speak for his companies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=71.88000000000001s)]
*  But as president, President Trump has a responsibility to fight for this country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=75.68s)]
*  And the one big, beautiful bill is the most historic piece of legislation that has moved [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  through Capitol Hill in modern day history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=85.12s)]
*  Not only does this bill provide the largest tax cut for middle class and working class [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=88.32s)]
*  families, it extends the Trump tax cuts in 2017. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  It also delivers on President Trump's key campaign promises that he went around the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=96.56s)]
*  country and spoke to voters across the country about, to huge applause. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=101.52s)]
*  No tax on tips for our service workers, no tax on overtime for our law enforcement officers [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=106.64s)]
*  who are putting in extra work, having details to put food on the table. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=111.76s)]
*  The Fraternal Order of the Police was at the White House today endorsing this piece of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=116.8s)]
*  legislation specifically because of the no tax on overtime provision. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=121.56s)]
*  This bill also effectively eliminates a tax on Social Security for our hardworking seniors. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  And not only that, it provides huge savings for the American taxpayers, $1.6 trillion [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=131.8s)]
*  in savings. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=137.36s)]
*  We can't solve our nation's decades old debt crisis overnight. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=138.68s)]
*  President Trump is practical and realistic about that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=142.72s)]
*  But this bill is a huge monumental step in the right direction. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  And it also provides critical funding for border security. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=150.0s)]
*  It will hire more ICE and Border Patrol agents across the country, which we desperately need [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=153.6s)]
*  to carry out the mass deportation effort that is underway. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=158.0s)]
*  And this bill also provides critical infrastructure for our national security and funding for [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=161.28s)]
*  the Golden Dome, which is another signature campaign promise of President Trump's. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=166.0s)]
*  Look, President Trump is the unequivocal leader of the Republican Party and this bill is going [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=170.4s)]
*  to pass. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=175.72s)]
*  President was very positive on his call with Chinese President Xi earlier today where they [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=177.68s)]
*  discussed almost for 90 minutes mostly about trade. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=182.32s)]
*  I think that's good for both countries. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=186.96s)]
*  I've always known we'd get to this point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=188.64s)]
*  I've always believed that China will need access to our markets and it's in everybody's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=190.48s)]
*  best interest to come to a deal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=194.96s)]
*  Can you give us any insight into that phone call? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=197.44s)]
*  Well sure, as the president said on Truth Social and also discussed in the Oval Office [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  today, this was a good, productive call. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=207.12s)]
*  And he has always enjoyed a respectful relationship with China's president. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=210.32s)]
*  And China needs the United States of America and our markets. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  And we also have a strategic interest in China's economy and market as well. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=219.4s)]
*  And so that's why both leaders decided today that their trade officials will continue to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=224.72s)]
*  meet to discuss this important bilateral relationship. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=230.0s)]
*  Let me ask you about the judge blocking this Colorado terrorist family and the deportation [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=234.08s)]
*  that was to take place and the travel ban that the president put in place yesterday. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  Well this is just another rogue decision by a rogue judge who is trying to be, I don't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=248.24s)]
*  know, the president of the United States, the secretary of state, the secretary of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=254.6s)]
*  Homeland Security. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=257.92s)]
*  Surely these important matters of both Homeland Security and national security do not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=259.16s)]
*  belong to lower district local judges in these districts across the country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=264.6s)]
*  They are trying to block the deportation of a terrorist family who has been illegally [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=270.68s)]
*  present in the interior of our country. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=276.0s)]
*  We also have a judge, as you know, Sean, who tried to block the deportation of illegal [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=279.2s)]
*  immigrant rapists and murderers to the country of South Sudan. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=284.56s)]
*  And so now those illegal immigrants, those rapists, those murderers, those brutal [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=288.8s)]
*  criminals are sitting in Djibouti and ICE agents have been forced to stay on the ground [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=293.68s)]
*  in a very dangerous part of the world to oversee the care of these illegal criminals and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=299.4s)]
*  migrants because a lower district court judge said that they have to. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=306.0s)]
*  Lower district court judges do not get to dictate the foreign policy and the national [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  security interests of the United States of America. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  We can't run a country if the executive is not allowed to freely exercise its powers. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing take place. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=323.2s)]
*  President Trump is not shy of lawfare, though. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=324.88s)]
*  It is something that he has faced throughout the entirety of his political career. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  So the Trump administration is fully prepared to fight these battles in court. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=332.92s)]
*  We will win on the merits of the law. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=336.12s)]
*  And we know we are winning in the court of public opinion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=338.32s)]
*  The American people overwhelmingly support the deportation of illegal criminals and especially [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=341.0s)]
*  known terrorists like the one who put the terrible terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=347.16s)]
*  on full display on Monday. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=353.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=356.04s)]
*  That's all White House briefing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=356.64s)]
*  Caroline Levitt, we always appreciate you being with us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=357.68s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_AmHBcDJgg&t=359.8s)]
