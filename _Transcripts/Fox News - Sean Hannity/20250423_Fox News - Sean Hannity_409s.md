# Tom Homan rips into Dems' 'silence' during these national security threats: 'UPSIDE-DOWN'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk)
*  This is your new, radicalized Democratic Party, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=0.0s)]
*  putting America and your life last every single day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=4.1s)]
*  Anyway, here with more is Trump's border czar, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=8.14s)]
*  Tom Homan, as well as, I mean, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=10.84s)]
*  let's start with this guy in El Salvador. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=13.14s)]
*  What do we know about this guy in El Salvador? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=16.28s)]
*  Did not one but two judges designate [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=18.18s)]
*  that this guy was a MS-13 gang member? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=20.88s)]
*  Well, he's home. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=24.86s)]
*  He's an illegal alien, MS-13 gang member, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=25.86s)]
*  classified now as a terrorist, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=29.86s)]
*  with an order of deportation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=32.86s)]
*  Two federal judges not only found he's an MS-13 member, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=34.86s)]
*  two federal judges issued an order of removal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=37.86s)]
*  He has an order of removal. He is home. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=40.86s)]
*  We removed the gang member terrorist whitebeater [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=42.86s)]
*  from this country because the court ordered him deported. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=45.86s)]
*  So I keep saying this, the worst thing that's going on [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=48.86s)]
*  and I keep saying this, the worst, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=52.86s)]
*  the best that can happen for him, Sean, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=54.86s)]
*  is he does come back to the United States. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=56.86s)]
*  We detain him immediately and we immediately remove him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=58.86s)]
*  He has an order of deportation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=61.86s)]
*  The withholding order doesn't mean anything [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=63.86s)]
*  since now the situation has changed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=65.86s)]
*  He is now a terrorist and the withholding order [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=67.86s)]
*  was about a gang who's afraid of going back [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=70.86s)]
*  to a country where the gang is going. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=72.86s)]
*  The gang doesn't exist anymore. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=74.86s)]
*  President Buccali shut it down. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=76.86s)]
*  So all the facts around the withholding have changed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=78.86s)]
*  We removed the gang, public safety threat, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=81.86s)]
*  MS-13 member, terrorist from this United States. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=84.86s)]
*  We did exactly what we should have done. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=87.86s)]
*  He's home. He's in his home country. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=89.86s)]
*  All right. They keep making the argument about due process, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=91.86s)]
*  due process, due process, and you had a pretty good line. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=95.86s)]
*  You said that this Guy Garcia got more due process [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=97.86s)]
*  than Lakin Reilly or I'll add Rachel Morin [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=101.86s)]
*  or I'll add Jocelyn Nungary or I can scroll the names [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=104.86s)]
*  of other Americans that have been murdered, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=107.86s)]
*  raped and victims of violent crime. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=109.86s)]
*  They didn't get any due process, did they? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=111.86s)]
*  No, they didn't. He got due process. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=113.86s)]
*  He got two immigration judges, two federal judges [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=116.86s)]
*  ordered him deported after a hearing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=119.86s)]
*  He got due process, but you're right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=121.86s)]
*  Angel moms and dads across this country, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=123.86s)]
*  they get no due process, just like the parents [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=125.86s)]
*  of the two that were killed in California. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=127.86s)]
*  They didn't get due process. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=130.86s)]
*  So they enter the country illegally, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=132.86s)]
*  so they ignore the legal process when they come here illegally, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=134.86s)]
*  and all of a sudden they get deported. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=137.86s)]
*  Now they want to take advantage of the legal process. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=138.86s)]
*  It's upside down, but we're going to keep doing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=140.86s)]
*  what we're doing, Sean. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=142.86s)]
*  Well, all right. So we have Hamas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=143.86s)]
*  It's a designated terror organization, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=145.86s)]
*  and you have foreign international students [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=147.86s)]
*  that are being held, and if you're sympathizing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=150.86s)]
*  with a terrorist organization, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=154.86s)]
*  a designated terrorist organization, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=156.86s)]
*  what gives you the right to stay in our country? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=158.86s)]
*  Doesn't that association or even moral support [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=162.86s)]
*  represent a clear and present danger to our country? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=166.86s)]
*  Absolutely, and you violate the terms of that visa. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=170.86s)]
*  Getting a visa to come to this country to study is a privilege, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=174.86s)]
*  and you have rules, rules that you have to qualify for [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=178.86s)]
*  to get that visa, so there's terms that you have to live by. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=182.86s)]
*  When you violate these terms, like supporting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=185.86s)]
*  a terrorist organization, that visa can be pulled [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=187.86s)]
*  when you're going home. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=189.86s)]
*  I'm in the export program, so the Department of State [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=190.86s)]
*  ends your status in the United States, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=193.86s)]
*  and my job is deport them, and that's what we're doing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=195.86s)]
*  They might have got away with that in the Biden administration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=198.86s)]
*  They're not going to get away with that in the Trump administration. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=200.86s)]
*  What message would you send to Van Hollen, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=203.86s)]
*  these four congressmen, the people going to Louisiana [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=207.86s)]
*  to appeal for the student? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=210.86s)]
*  What message do you have for all of them? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=213.86s)]
*  Where were you when thousands of American parents [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=218.86s)]
*  buried their children? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=220.86s)]
*  They got separated from their children forever [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=221.86s)]
*  because they were killed by illegal aliens [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=223.86s)]
*  to enter this country illegally. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=226.86s)]
*  That's preventable crimes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=228.86s)]
*  Where were you when the 600 percent increase [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=229.86s)]
*  in sex trafficking with the Biden administration? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=231.86s)]
*  Where were you when 10.5 million people [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=233.86s)]
*  came to our borders illegally? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=235.86s)]
*  Where were you when men were released in the United States [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=237.86s)]
*  and defied the federal law? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=239.86s)]
*  The law says you come to this country, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=241.86s)]
*  you come to our borders for our profit documentation, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=243.86s)]
*  you shall be detained, not released, shall be detained. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=245.86s)]
*  Where were you when they released the millions of people [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=247.86s)]
*  in the United States? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=249.86s)]
*  Where were you when a record number of people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=250.86s)]
*  on terrorist watch lists crossed this border [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=252.86s)]
*  and were released in the United States with no vetting? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=254.86s)]
*  Where were you when a quarter million Americans [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=256.86s)]
*  died from fentanyl coming across the border, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=258.86s)]
*  open border, Biden administration? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=260.86s)]
*  Where were you then? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=261.86s)]
*  You were silent, which means you're complicit. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=262.86s)]
*  You didn't say a word about the violation of laws [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=264.86s)]
*  that put America at great risk. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=266.86s)]
*  Not just public safety, national security. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=268.86s)]
*  So where were you then? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=271.86s)]
*  It's pathetic and disgusting. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=273.86s)]
*  They are elected by the people to represent [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=275.86s)]
*  the taxpayers of this country. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=277.86s)]
*  When you don't care about your constituency, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=279.86s)]
*  when you don't care about public safety [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=281.86s)]
*  and national security, you're an embarrassment [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=283.86s)]
*  to the position you hold. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=285.86s)]
*  Where were you the last four years? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=286.86s)]
*  That's a great question, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=288.86s)]
*  and I'd like to see them try and answer it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=290.86s)]
*  And they lied to us on top of it [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=292.86s)]
*  and said the border was closed and the border was secure, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=294.86s)]
*  and our own eyes showed us differently. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=296.86s)]
*  One of the people, there are now, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=298.86s)]
*  the Trump administration, under your leadership, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=301.86s)]
*  have been able to nab over more than 200,000 people [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=304.86s)]
*  more than 200 known or suspected terrorists since January, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=308.86s)]
*  including one of India's most wanted terrorists. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=311.86s)]
*  What do you know about this guy? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=315.86s)]
*  First of all, President Trump secured the border [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=319.86s)]
*  in seven weeks, which Joe Biden couldn't want to do in four years. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=321.86s)]
*  Today, we had the safest, most secure border [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=325.86s)]
*  in history of this nation today because of President Trump. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=329.86s)]
*  Look, we wrestled a lot of terrorists. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=332.86s)]
*  We got a lot more to find. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=333.86s)]
*  We got over two million gotaways. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=335.86s)]
*  Who are they? Where do they come from? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=337.86s)]
*  So we're working with the intelligence community, FBI, Department of Justice. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=338.86s)]
*  We got more to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=341.86s)]
*  But yes, we've wrestled more criminals in the first three months [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=343.86s)]
*  than Joe Biden did in a year. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=346.86s)]
*  We tripled that number. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=348.86s)]
*  So we got more to find, Sean. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=349.86s)]
*  There's a lot of public safety threats out there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=351.86s)]
*  About 600,000 illegal aliens with criminal records we got to find. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=354.86s)]
*  But what concerns me the most is the two main gotaways. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=358.86s)]
*  Who are they? Where do they come from? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=361.86s)]
*  We don't know, but we're working very hard [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=363.86s)]
*  with the intelligence community to try to find out where these people are, who they are. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=365.86s)]
*  They need to be arrested. They need to be detained. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=368.86s)]
*  They need to be removed. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=370.86s)]
*  So we're doing great, but we got a hell of a lot more to do, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=371.86s)]
*  which is now a message to Congress. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=374.86s)]
*  Give us the funding to continue this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=376.86s)]
*  The more money we have, the more we can do, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=378.86s)]
*  the more agents we can put on the street, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=381.86s)]
*  the more beds we can buy, put people in, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=383.86s)]
*  the more we can deport them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=385.86s)]
*  We need Congress to fund this operation [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=386.86s)]
*  so we can keep President Trump's promise to the American people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=388.86s)]
*  Yeah, Tom Homan, great job. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=391.86s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ3p2dYuFhk&t=394.86s)]
