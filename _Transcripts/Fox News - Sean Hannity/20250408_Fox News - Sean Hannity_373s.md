# 'BLUE-DOLLAR COMEBACK:' GOP lawmakers express hope for fulfilling Trump's agenda
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0)
*  Lindsey, let me go to you, because the Budget Committee, as chair, this reconciliation process, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=0.0s)]
*  really, you're the one that triggered this, which I think is very important. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=6.76s)]
*  Otherwise, you'd have to get the approval of the Senate parliamentarian. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=11.32s)]
*  Well, so, it's our belief that elected officials should make big decisions, not unelected bureaucrats. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=14.64s)]
*  I like the parliamentarian. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  But it's not her decision to set the baseline as mine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=23.68s)]
*  When Democrats were in charge, they set the baseline. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  Under the Budget Control Act of 1974, you can spend all the money you want. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=29.78s)]
*  You don't have to pay for it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=33.78s)]
*  But when you cut taxes after a period of time, that considers to be raising the deficit. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  We all know if you cut taxes, you get more money into the government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  We all believe that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=45.24s)]
*  So by 53 of us got together, and we changed the way the Washington works. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  From here on out, taxes will be treated as spending. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=53.52s)]
*  They will be considered not to expire. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=57.36s)]
*  They don't add to the debt. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  They add revenue to the government. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=60.96s)]
*  I made that decision. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  To be clear, these tax cuts expire. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  The Trump tax cuts are scheduled to expire. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  In December, what does it mean? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  $1,900 per family. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=70.0s)]
*  If you're in business, you're going to lose your deductions, expensing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=71.66s)]
*  Child tax credit goes down by 90. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=75.84s)]
*  We're playing with real bullets here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=77.64s)]
*  I just say this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  The debt ceiling, the debt extension, as President Trump called it, we got to pay the credit [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  card bill it comes due. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=85.4s)]
*  If we don't put it in this bill, and we have to get 10 Democrats in the Senate to extend [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=87.12s)]
*  the debt ceiling, the price they will want will be unbelievable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=92.5s)]
*  They will extort everybody here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=97.66000000000001s)]
*  They will extort President Trump to the people watching tonight. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=99.62s)]
*  We got a chance to make the tax cuts permanent, fully fund the border, help the military, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  get the debt ceiling extended without one Democratic vote, only if reconciliation works. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  Four times in 100 years. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  If we screw this up, you should be really pissed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=116.94s)]
*  We can't afford to screw this up. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=120.22s)]
*  Senator Cotton, your take, and where do you think we are in the process? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=122.56s)]
*  Well, I think we've taken an important first step last week in the Senate by passing that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  budget and sending it to the House. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=130.16s)]
*  You heard the President just a few moments ago talking about the need for unity. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=131.6s)]
*  We obviously have some differences of opinion here on this or that issue, along with 50 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=135.56s)]
*  or two other of my colleagues as well. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=139.88s)]
*  But on this, we're all unified around the need to not just extend the 2017 tax cuts, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=142.4s)]
*  but to improve them with some of the ideas that the President campaigned on, that we [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=147.6s)]
*  all campaigned on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=150.88s)]
*  No tax tips? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=152.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=153.12s)]
*  Overtime social security? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=154.12s)]
*  It's secure our border. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=155.12s)]
*  It's not just a security issue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=156.12s)]
*  It's also a quality of life issue in your communities because illegal migrants put strain [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=158.26000000000002s)]
*  on schools and hospitals and other public services, making sure that we're safe abroad [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  as well by funding our military and getting the price of energy down, whether it's what [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  you pay for gas at the pump or your electricity. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  That's the goals that unite all of us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=173.94s)]
*  That's what we came together around last week with Lindsey and John Thune's leadership. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=175.54s)]
*  And I think that's what Mike Johnson is going to have in the House later this week. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  Senator Scott. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=182.0s)]
*  To me, this is the beginning of the blue collar comeback. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=183.0s)]
*  Imagine $7 trillion. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  That's a great line. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  I wish I thought of that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  We can share it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=189.88s)]
*  We can share it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=190.88s)]
*  I mean, think about it, though. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=191.88s)]
*  So many Americans feel invisible in the Biden economy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=192.88s)]
*  This is the Trump economy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=198.06s)]
*  Think about $7 trillion descending upon the greatest nation on God's green earth, creating [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  high paying, high manufacturing jobs. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  That means $100,000 plus $1,000 a year coming into communities across this country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  The first time we did it, the TCJA, we saw more revenue to the Treasury and we saw $4,000 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  per family in their pockets. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=220.92s)]
*  It's the American people's dollars. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=223.32s)]
*  Let them keep it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  This blue collar comeback, it's real. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=227.22s)]
*  President Trump is the man we need with a steel spine to get the job done. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=229.56s)]
*  70 countries? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=236.44s)]
*  It's a good day in America. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=237.44s)]
*  Senator Cruz. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=239.84s)]
*  Look, failure is not an option. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=240.84s)]
*  You look at the election in November, it is as clear a mandate as we've ever seen from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=243.56s)]
*  the American people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=247.12s)]
*  And I'll tell you, one of the things that I am impressed with in both the Senate and [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=248.12s)]
*  House is I think Republicans understand we have a job to do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=252.28s)]
*  We can't screw this up. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=256.24s)]
*  Now what is that job? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=258.48s)]
*  Number one, the mandate, secure the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=259.6s)]
*  That is the single clearest mandate out of this election. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=262.0s)]
*  12 million people invaded this country and the American people said enough is enough. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=264.56s)]
*  And I got to say, by the way, my favorite line from the President's State of the Union [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=268.76s)]
*  address is when he pointed out, he said, you know, Joe Biden stood up here a year ago and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=272.04s)]
*  said he couldn't secure the border without new legislation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, it turns out we didn't need new legislation, we just needed a new president. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=280.04s)]
*  We've seen illegal border crossings drop 98 percent. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=285.32s)]
*  That's delivering on results. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=290.04s)]
*  But now it's our job to come and provide the funding to build the wall, to put in technology, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  to put in border patrol, to put in ICE, to make sure that we keep our families safe and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=296.12s)]
*  secure when it comes to energy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=301.12s)]
*  The American people are fed up with high energy costs. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  We want America to lead the world in energy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=305.88s)]
*  When it comes to rebuilding the military, you're right, it is a dangerous, dangerous [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=308.68s)]
*  world. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  And when it comes to the tax cuts, we're going to extend the tax cuts. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=313.56s)]
*  It's going to be bumpy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=316.96s)]
*  It's always bumpy, and particularly with the House, which has an excruciatingly small majority. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=318.2s)]
*  But we will get the job done because the alternative, if we do nothing, is an automatic $4 trillion [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  tax increase. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=330.68s)]
*  We're not going to let that happen because if we do, we'll be failing in our jobs. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=331.68s)]
*  That is not acceptable. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=337.2s)]
*  We'll get the job done, and the president won't let that happen. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=338.2s)]
*  The House doesn't get it done. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=340.32s)]
*  They're going to be hurting themselves again. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=342.12s)]
*  Because the sooner we get away from the Biden-Harris economy, the odds go up exponentially that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=344.96s)]
*  they have a better chance to get re-elected. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=351.52s)]
*  They're up in two years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=353.44s)]
*  And there are lots of trade-offs in it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=354.44s)]
*  Look, most of us have been part of the process of tax cuts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  I've got to take a break. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=358.48s)]
*  All right, more with our panel. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=359.48s)]
*  Get it anywhere else. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGk0KjNO4p0&t=370.32s)]
