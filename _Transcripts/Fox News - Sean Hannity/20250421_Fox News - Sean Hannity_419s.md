# ‘F*** YOU!’: Nancy Mace faces off with man at beauty store
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw)
*  Alright, so it was probably the biggest viral video of the weekend. South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace posted this now infamous video online [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=0.0s)]
*  After a man who is allegedly one of her constituents confronted her while she was shopping. Take a look. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  I do them every year. You want to keep going? You want to keep going? Keep harassing me? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=14.44s)]
*  You could have gone to a dozen town halls last year. I asked if you're doing any more this year. It was one simple question. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=19.84s)]
*  Yeah, are you doing it? I've already done one. I'll do plenty more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=24.92s)]
*  You're always invited. Okay, by the way, I voted for gay marriage twice. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=29.1s)]
*  What does that have to do with me? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=34.34s)]
*  So I'm just saying it has to do everything to do with you. You think everything about me has to do with gay marriage? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=35.34s)]
*  I do. Absolutely. That's your first chance when you speak with me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=39.74s)]
*  Because you people on the left are crazy. So I'm absolutely f***ing crazy. I'm absolutely f***ing crazy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=41.74s)]
*  Alright, get out of my face. Goodbye. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=47.74s)]
*  You're insane. You're going to f*** me? You're going to be voted out so fast this year? I can't wait for you to f*** me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=50.74s)]
*  I won by so much. You're a disgrace to this state. That's what you are. You're a disgrace. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=56.34s)]
*  I asked you a simple question and you just to go on this tirade and tell me f*** you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=61.34s)]
*  Yeah, f*** you. Disgusting. Get out of my face. F*** you. Get out of my face. Try it. What's your name? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=64.34s)]
*  What's your name? What's your name? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=69.34s)]
*  Did you say f*** me? Yep, I sure did. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=72.34s)]
*  Because the person you're insane is f***ing me for asking you a question. Absolutely. Get the f*** out of my face. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=74.34s)]
*  F*** you. Now. F*** you. F*** you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=77.34s)]
*  It's a peaceful weekend afternoon going shopping, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=79.94s)]
*  In a post on Facebook, the man in that video said in part that he won't apologize for speaking up or for publicly asking a politician to do her job. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=83.94s)]
*  Here with her side of the story, Congresswoman Nancy Mace. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=93.94s)]
*  Congresswoman, well apparently you've had a very eventful weekend. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=96.94s)]
*  Apparently there's another video I was just told you might have put up. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=99.94s)]
*  But let's go to this video in particular. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=102.94s)]
*  What happened? What was going on behind the scenes? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  And how did the issue of gay rights come up in that conversation? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, right. I just wanted some face wash. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  That was it. I went to the store. I had a little bit of time to myself on Saturday afternoon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  Want to go shopping like I do. I'm a normal person. I do my own grocery shopping. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  And this guy approached me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  And I will tell you, I felt threatened. I felt harassed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=130.54s)]
*  And I will tell you as someone who's experienced trauma in her life, and a lot of women will understand what I'm talking about, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=134.14s)]
*  when some guy gets in your face and approaches you in the aggressive manner that he did, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=140.14s)]
*  and you feel like you're in danger, instinctively as women who've been through trauma, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=147.14s)]
*  who've survived sexual assault, survived domestic abuse, you have two options. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=154.14s)]
*  You can fight or you can flee. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=159.14s)]
*  And Sean, I'm a fighter. And I've never stood back down from a fight. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  I will stand my ground like any strong woman should. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  And I will tell you, this was the third incident I had last week alone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  The incidences of threats, the threat of violence, the people coming up and harassing me in public [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  has increased exponentially over the last six months since I came out, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  standing up against the trans community, standing up against men in women's dresses. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  And I just had an event at the University of South Carolina about an hour ago. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=188.34s)]
*  I wrapped it up, and a man in a dress picked up a potted plant and acted like he was going to throw it against me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=193.34s)]
*  I just posted that video on Twitter. You can follow it at NancyMace.org. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=200.34s)]
*  You can find it online. But my security team thought he was going to throw the plant at me because I used the word babe. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=206.34s)]
*  He was offended by it. And then I used the word trans, and he was more offended by it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=212.34s)]
*  The lunatics on the left, they're dangerous. And women need to stand up for themselves. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=217.34s)]
*  And I was the first member of Congress to say, I'm going to hold the line for women and girls everywhere. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=221.34s)]
*  And since that time, the amount of aggression that I've had from mentally ill men, from men in dresses, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=226.34s)]
*  from men approaching me in public like this guy, this Daisy Duke guy, the short shorts guy, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=233.34s)]
*  just as I was trying to buy face wash, it's not okay. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=238.34s)]
*  And condoning this kind of behavior is only going to lead to violence. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=242.34s)]
*  Or did anything happen prior to you starting? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=245.34s)]
*  It was not. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=249.34s)]
*  What happened prior to that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=250.34s)]
*  Well, he started up on me prior to this and I fumbled. I tried to get my phone out as quick as I could. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=251.34s)]
*  But I had a bag and I tried to pull it out fast and start recording as much as I could. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  I've decided that I'm going to start recording these people in public. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  I probably don't have enough iPhone space on my phone, but I deal with this stuff day in and day out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  This was the third incident I had last week alone. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=273.34s)]
*  And the week before that, there was a man in Pennsylvania who was arrested from Butler, Pennsylvania, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=276.34s)]
*  that threatened the president, President Trump. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=281.34s)]
*  I was the only member of Congress. He threatened to put a bullet in my skull. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=283.34s)]
*  Most of this stems from my position about protecting women and girls in private spaces. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=286.34s)]
*  And inherently as a woman, when a man like this comes up to me and is aggressive in public or private, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=292.34s)]
*  inherently I'm going to fight back. I'm going to stand my ground. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=299.34s)]
*  I'm going to be a strong woman because I'm going to put my money where my mouth is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=302.34s)]
*  Men like this, it's not okay. This kind of aggression is going to get someone hurt or worse. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=306.34s)]
*  And it's not something I condone. I'll stand up and fight for every woman and girl everywhere. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=311.34s)]
*  We see those on the left that have been pro-Hamas, a designated terrorist organization. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=317.34s)]
*  Some on the left, this obsession with Luigi Mangione, the alleged assassin of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=323.34s)]
*  We've seen domestic terrorism at Tesla dealerships against Tesla owners and charging stations. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=331.34s)]
*  Open calls for assassination of people like Elon Musk and President Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=338.34s)]
*  It seems like everything is getting really ratcheted up. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=343.34s)]
*  The left's gone really off the deep end. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=347.34s)]
*  And I'm very concerned about violence. Why don't you have security with you at all times? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=351.34s)]
*  Well, in this instance, I was on my personal time. I can't afford personal private security. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=359.34s)]
*  I have to reassess my movements now and perhaps trying to hide the way that I look so I can go out in public. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=366.34s)]
*  Tonight, though, at a public event, I was able to have six armed security guards. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=372.34s)]
*  I needed to have that and even still was six armed security guards. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=376.34s)]
*  We had a man in a dress who picked up a potted plant. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=380.34s)]
*  It looked like he was going to toss it at me or throw it at me until the police moved in. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=383.34s)]
*  That's the kind of threats that conservatives are facing like Elon Musk, like Donald Trump, every single day. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=387.34s)]
*  We have to stand up and fight back and fight for ourselves, stand up for our own freedom. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=393.34s)]
*  That's what it's about. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=398.34s)]
*  Okay, Congresswoman, I'm glad nothing more has happened here. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=400.34s)]
*  We appreciate you spending your time with us. Thank you. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=404.34s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qiu-VA7LPmw&t=417.34s)]
