# WATCH: Speaker Johnson reveals latest on the House floor
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g)
*  Speaker of the House of Representatives and that is Mike Johnson is with us. The magic number 217 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, this is the test vote [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=7.36s)]
*  You have nine members that have not voted at this point. You have four nays [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  You can only afford three bring us behind the scenes [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of discussions are going on what's happening [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=17.6s)]
*  Yeah, Chad programs got it right as usual except there's no cracking of skulls Sean [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=21.36s)]
*  This is this part of the process we are we are tying up some loose ends [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  We had a Senate bill that was sent over that was modified from the house version [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=29.36s)]
*  We like the house version better. That's no surprise about that. And we had reached a very delicate balance on it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  so it's taken a little while to go through the changes to have everybody fully process that and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=39.72s)]
*  And figure out what that means for them in their districts and that that's part of the process. So [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=45.2s)]
*  No, no, no huge pressure here. We're allowing these conversations to continue [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=49.76s)]
*  Chad was right. I might keep it open a little while because I have among those no votes [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  I've got a couple of folks that are actually off-site right now had to attend a family [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=59.54s)]
*  Affairs or events this evening and so some of them are on the way back [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=64.06s)]
*  And then a couple of others were having still some conversations [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=68.22s)]
*  So I want to say this president Trump is the consummate dealmaker. He's the greatest one of all time [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  He brought in different groups of members to the White House today [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=77.86s)]
*  He was fully engaged in the process vice president JD Vance as well [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=80.94s)]
*  I mean they had been the partners in this we're all in it together and it is a one-team approach and I'm absolutely [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=84.86s)]
*  Confident we are going to land this plane and deliver for the American people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=90.34s)]
*  You know, mr. Speaker [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  I've talked to the White House numerous times today people within the White House and I was told very clearly that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=96.7s)]
*  The president is very engaged and he has been very very explicit and very clear [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=103.62s)]
*  That this is not the end this is just the first step and you put on X today a list of all of the things [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=109.46s)]
*  that this accomplishes [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=117.74s)]
*  Sure, I understand a lot of the complaints about the changes in the Senate bill [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=120.14s)]
*  I can only tell you haven't been up all night [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=125.36s)]
*  You know two nights ago as this was all going on at 2 a.m. 3 a.m. 4 a.m. 5 a.m. 6 a.m. 7 a.m [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=127.86s)]
*  they didn't have the votes and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=134.94s)]
*  And they just kept working at it working at it and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=137.06s)]
*  They did not know where Lisa Murkowski was gonna vote until about 8 8 30 in the morning [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=140.34s)]
*  And then they were able to get to final passage [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=145.18s)]
*  I agree with your approach to I think these should be conversations. I think generally speaking I would imagine that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=147.98s)]
*  Most Republicans like the idea the biggest tax cut in history [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=155.78s)]
*  I like I would think they like the idea of standing up for working men and women [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=158.96s)]
*  With the provisions no tax on tips and overtime. I think they they see a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=162.82s)]
*  Emergency at our southern border that the Democrats left a mess there. I think they see the importance of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=168.98s)]
*  Taking on a neglected Department of Defense and building the iron a big iron dome [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=175.46s)]
*  Or golden dome as the president calls it. I think they see the importance of reforming education [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=180.6s)]
*  I think they see the importance of energy dominance [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=185.5s)]
*  So there's a lot of good in there and and by the way some of the changes the Senate made [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=187.58s)]
*  It really ticks me off to be honest [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=191.94s)]
*  But having been awake all that night and talking to senators all night [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=194.14s)]
*  I knew that was the only bill that they were gonna pass if this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=198.46s)]
*  there's no way this bill can go back to the Senate and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=203.58s)]
*  They would make the changes and that there would be an agreement between the two chambers at this point. I don't see that part [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=206.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's right [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=213.46s)]
*  we want to avoid a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=214.38s)]
*  Ping-pong scenario where it goes back and forth between the chambers because then your chances of success [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=215.66s)]
*  Are diminished and and so we believe we can get everybody. Yes, we've got to get the final questions answered [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  The White House has been very [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  helpful in that and and fully cooperative and and you know that that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=229.58s)]
*  Increases our chances of success here wait that the risk of failure is too great [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=234.18s)]
*  All those things that you just said are included in this legislation [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  We call it the one big beautiful bill for a reason because it is both and an eighty five [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=241.54s)]
*  Percent or so of the president's agenda and campaign promises are wrapped into this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=246.85999999999999s)]
*  We are going to deliver it and we got to do it as soon as possible [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  The reason we put it on this aggressive timeline to do it by July 4th is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  It's not just so we can celebrate Independence Day and all the great things here [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=258.74s)]
*  But we're going to get relief to the American people Sean [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=262.14s)]
*  This is going to be as we you and I've discussed jet fuel to the US economy. We all boats are going to rise [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=264.86s)]
*  We're gonna have higher wages. We're gonna have more jobs more investment in America more opportunity [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=270.34s)]
*  this is the American First Agenda and in every Republican in the house and the Senate understand the necessity of that and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=276.42s)]
*  Delivering it and we're going to do just that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=282.62s)]
*  Let me let me go to the people that have not voted yet [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=285.3s)]
*  That's nine and you need one nay vote to flip to yay and you get to the magic number 217 [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=288.46s)]
*  You said that a number of members were driving back [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=294.86s)]
*  You called the vote late [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  They were at events. They were at dinner. They were they live in Virginia [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  So they're making their way back [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=304.38s)]
*  how many how many members would you count in that group and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=305.98s)]
*  For the people that that maybe are unhappy with the Senate version [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=310.18s)]
*  Which by the way, I kind of agree with some I agree with them on a lot of their their objections [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=314.7s)]
*  However, the good [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=319.66s)]
*  Overcomes this and the promise of the president that he's gonna you know through executive action and future legislation [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=321.1s)]
*  If he makes a promise I've known him for 30 years. He means what he says [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=327.5s)]
*  so how many of these members are coming back the people that have not voted and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=331.74s)]
*  And what are the conversations like are they civil is there screaming and yelling in the cloak cloak room or no? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=336.18s)]
*  No, we haven't had any screaming and yelling. It's it's it's been very I think [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=343.5s)]
*  very cooperative and in its nature and conciliatory everybody wants to get to yes and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  You know, they were concerned about some of the amendments from the Senate, but that's the nature of this deliberative body [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=356.38s)]
*  You have two different chambers. You have lots of different interests and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=361.54s)]
*  And they all have to come together in the end [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=365.98s)]
*  This is how the the founders envisioned that it would work a lot of a lot of hard work behind the scenes a lot of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  You know rolling up the sleeves and arm wrestling around the table [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=373.18s)]
*  But at the end everybody's on the same team and they have to do that in an agreeable manner [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=376.14000000000004s)]
*  That's what's been happening today [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=379.98s)]
*  I can tell you that everybody who visited with the president was delighted by the visit [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=381.42s)]
*  Of course, you know, you've been in those scenarios with him all the time. He's he's a great [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=386.26000000000005s)]
*  Host and and he loves bringing people over to the White House and having those conversations. He is deeply involved [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=390.1s)]
*  He knows the policy [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=395.62s)]
*  He knows exactly what we're doing with the agenda and he can answer most of the members have himself [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=396.94s)]
*  Is the president talking to members directly tonight? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=402.26000000000005s)]
*  He has been in fact, he called me most recently about an hour ago and said who else needs to have a discussion [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=406.26000000000005s)]
*  I'm ready to get on the phone. I said miss president you've done your job and we'll do ours here [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean he is he has been fully a participant in this whole thing [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=416.38s)]
*  and that's a such a refreshing thing for members of Congress to know that you have a commander-in-chief who is so engaged like that and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=420.5s)]
*  In helping to carry the ball over the line [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=428.3s)]
*  It's really been a great working relationship in the whole that the cabinet and we had cabinet secretaries engaged today and conversations [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=430.1s)]
*  Answering questions in their areas. I mean, it's just an incredible team in the White House and in the Congress as well [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=437.86s)]
*  So we are going to get this job done. Everybody will celebrate together [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=443.7s)]
*  but the real celebration will be by the American people because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=447.18s)]
*  They were going to see the effects of this quickly and it's going to be a great thing for the whole country [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=450.78s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, how long do you plan on keeping the vote open? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=455.74s)]
*  Chad I think he talked about the record being over seven hours. I'll go back to him in a minute [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=459.78s)]
*  Or you know, you're just going to keep it open as long as it takes [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=465.34s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'll keep it open as long as it takes to make sure we've got everybody here in a kind of war and all [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=469.5s)]
*  The questions answered I made that commitment to my members [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=475.02s)]
*  you know, we're in an area an era of Congress or we have small margins small majorities and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=477.53999999999996s)]
*  That makes it by necessity a bottom-up institution [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=483.62s)]
*  You know, it's not a couple leaders in a back room like the old days where you know [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=486.66s)]
*  Two or three people decide the agenda and it's hoisted upon everyone else and they take orders and follow it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  It really is a fully participatory [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=495.1s)]
*  Deliberative body and that means bottom-up member driven process [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=498.22s)]
*  I've tried to decentralize the power of the speaker's office so much as that is possible in our system [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=501.5s)]
*  And I think people appreciate that they all know their voices were heard in this and remember [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=506.36s)]
*  We put on about 14 months of work into the production of the one big beautiful bill [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=510.38s)]
*  So a lot of time a lot of deliberation a lot of committee hearings and meetings and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=515.18s)]
*  Everybody's got their voice heard and I think it's a really important part of this [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=520.3s)]
*  Let's talk about the four nay votes that are on the board right now. I assume you've spoken to all four of them [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=524.26s)]
*  What indication are you getting from them that they might be willing to switch? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=531.66s)]
*  well, I have spoken to all of them and well at three of the four trying to find a fourth one, but [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  A couple of those are still waiting for some of those questions to be answered and they're just sort of putting placeholders on the board [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=543.5799999999999s)]
*  And and you know, I think they're open for conversation [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=549.74s)]
*  Everybody's here in good faith [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=553.1s)]
*  Everybody wants to get the yes. Everybody wants to deliver this agenda for the people and we're gonna give them every opportunity to do that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1XmvQBqy3g&t=554.54s)]
