# Peter Doocy recounts 'how bad' 'bubble wrapped' Biden was: 'See for yourself'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA)
*  As Peter Ducey can report firsthand, then-Biden White House at that time was a house of cards, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=0.0s)]
*  built on lies and smears. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=7.3s)]
*  He's the only one I recall calling it out regularly. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=9.3s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=12.3s)]
*  President Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=13.3s)]
*  Why does White House staff treat him like a baby? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=16.3s)]
*  No one treats the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, like a baby. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=19.3s)]
*  So there's this vote that says— [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=23.3s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=24.3s)]
*  It's a ridiculous claim. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=25.3s)]
*  How is President Biden ever going to convince the three-quarters of voters who are worried [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=26.6s)]
*  about his physical and mental health that he is okay, even though in Las Vegas he told [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=31.1s)]
*  a story about recently talking to a French president who died in 1996? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=35.9s)]
*  I'm not even going to go down that rabbit hole with you, sir. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=40.9s)]
*  One of the reasons you were not charged is because, in his description, you are a well-meaning, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=49.6s)]
*  I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=53.0s)]
*  I've been president and I put this country back on its feet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=57.0s)]
*  I don't need his recommendation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=60.0s)]
*  It's totally— [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=61.0s)]
*  How bad is your memory and can you continue as president? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=62.0s)]
*  My memory is so bad, I let you speak. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=65.0s)]
*  Here with more, our very own Peter Ducey. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=68.0s)]
*  Peter, I just want—you were one of the few to be willing to call him out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=71.0s)]
*  Why weren't your colleagues willing to call him out? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=76.0s)]
*  I tried, Sean, and I don't know. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=81.1s)]
*  It would seem like there was a fear in the room that asking a hard question about the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=83.1s)]
*  president's acuity, about his mental fitness, could mean a loss of access. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=90.1s)]
*  But based on everything that we have learned now, nobody had access. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=93.6s)]
*  It was the president and a handful of aides that were with him for 50 years up in the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=98.0s)]
*  residence with the first lady and the first son, and that was it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=102.1s)]
*  My experience with the first couple years of President Biden was that he really liked [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  to mix it up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=111.69999999999999s)]
*  He wanted the hard questions, but he was then bubble-wrapped and he was completely isolated, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=112.69999999999999s)]
*  which obviously did not serve him very well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  What I would say about those clips, though, is with journalism and reporting, it's always [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=120.1s)]
*  better to be right than first. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  But as it turns out, we, by covering this—and you and I talked about it on the show all [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  the time for years—we were right and first, and it just took everybody else a couple years [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  to get there, to join us there. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=138.1s)]
*  But I was with Joe Biden on his first day of his campaign. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  I was there on the last day of the campaign, and I have heard some stories about how the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=145.1s)]
*  way that some people in town remember it, nobody was putting questions directly to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=153.0s)]
*  Biden White House about any of this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  That's not what I remember. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=160.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=163.7s)]
*  How bad did you think it was at the time? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=165.7s)]
*  It depended on the day, but the hardest questions are usually the simplest ones. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=172.1s)]
*  And something that I do before I go into these White House briefings, I kind of try to take [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=179.5s)]
*  a poll everywhere I go, at the grocery store, at the airport, and the one thing everybody [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=184.0s)]
*  that I met wanted to know while I was on the Biden beat was, is he OK? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=188.8s)]
*  I saw this clip. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=194.0s)]
*  They're saying it's a cheap fake. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=195.5s)]
*  What is going on with this guy? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, you bring it in, just you bring it to the press briefing room, which was usually [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=198.4s)]
*  the only opportunity to get anything on or off the record from this very, very walled-off [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  White House, and you would just ask, like, hey, why is he saying that he just talked to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  a dead guy? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=214.4s)]
*  Or who is going to answer the phone after 8 p.m. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=215.3s)]
*  when he apparently is no longer as sharp as he is in the middle of the day? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=220.5s)]
*  And you heard one of the answers from Karine Jean-Pierre there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  She said it was a rabbit hole to suggest that the things that we could see with our eyes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=228.3s)]
*  and hear with our ears were actually a problem. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=235.5s)]
*  It's unclear now if that was based on her experience or if that is what she was being [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=239.3s)]
*  told to say, but it's, you can see for yourself how bad it was. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=243.4s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  Peter, all credit to you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  You were the only one, really, that went after it hard and told the truth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=254.0s)]
*  And, you know what, nothing but respect for doing your job. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=257.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=261.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dwSETM91QA&t=273.4s)]
