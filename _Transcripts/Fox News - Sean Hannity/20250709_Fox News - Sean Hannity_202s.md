# Dennis Quaid appreciates first-responders in Texas who 'run in when everyone else is running out'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o)
*  Dennis Quaid, the new movie comes out Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=0.0s)]
*  I know your thoughts are consumed with what's happening in your native Texas. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=2.44s)]
*  And you heard Senator Cruz, President Trump is scheduled to be there on Friday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=6.24s)]
*  What do you think the rest of us can do now to actually help? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=10.52s)]
*  Well, I'm from Texas myself. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=13.84s)]
*  In fact, I spent two summers as a child in the Hill Country of Texas at summer camp. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=17.48s)]
*  And the Hill Country of Texas is a magical place. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=23.82s)]
*  It truly is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=28.1s)]
*  Especially for children. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=29.56s)]
*  And going to camp there, it's a memory, a cherished memory that you carry with you all of your life. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=30.84s)]
*  And my daughter was actually a few miles away from Mystic as well, further north. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=38.92s)]
*  And thankfully, they were, their camp was OK. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=48.0s)]
*  But the Guadalupe is something that hasn't happened. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  They're saying, I guess since 1900 was the last time an event like this happened, and no one saw it coming. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=57.76s)]
*  But my heart goes out to everybody. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=65.28s)]
*  My heart goes out to the Hunt family, friends of my wife Laura's and I's, and Janie Hunt, who was lost that weekend. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=68.92s)]
*  And I can't imagine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=80.36s)]
*  So much loss and devastation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=81.36s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=82.52s)]
*  I can't imagine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=83.52s)]
*  None of us can. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, I know we all need to take a break. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  We've started a Kerr County, we have a Kerr County flood relief fund that we are telling people if they want to donate some money to. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=87.36s)]
*  Just take some of that money out of your wallet or your credit card or on your phone and write a check. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  You could do it in five minutes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=107.4s)]
*  Just go to Kerr County Flood Relief Fund. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=108.68s)]
*  And that's at communityfoundation.net. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=113.12s)]
*  Communityfoundation.net. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=117.64s)]
*  It would be greatly appreciated. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  It'll go right where it needs to go because it's local. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, Americans, Mr. Quaid Texans, strong, resilient, faithful people, even in the face of a tragedy like this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=126.8s)]
*  I don't think Scott Ruskin should call himself a dude. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=135.96s)]
*  He seems like a hero, the former Coast Guard gentleman who's rescuing so many people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=138.24s)]
*  Are you hearing other acts of heroism like that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=143.4s)]
*  Can you lift us up a little bit? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=146.08s)]
*  Give us some hope. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=147.28s)]
*  Well, you know, it's those guys, those first responders, all those people, they run in when everybody else is running out and they don't even think twice. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  And their hearts are as big as they come. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=165.64s)]
*  And thank God we have people like that on this earth. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=169.04s)]
*  They teach us all and who very value, value life, cherish. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=173.32s)]
*  They're God's angels. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=180.4s)]
*  That's who they are. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=181.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxvkhpP2q4o&t=182.84s)]
