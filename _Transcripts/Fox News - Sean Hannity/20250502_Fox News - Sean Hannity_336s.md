# Newt Gingrich tears into Kamala Harris' ‘goofy’ comeback address
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE)
*  Here with reaction to all tonight's top stories, Fox News contributor, former speaker of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=0.0s)]
*  House, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=3.68s)]
*  You know, I liked hearing that speech in Alabama. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=5.84s)]
*  As a matter of fact, we met in the state of Alabama. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=9.0s)]
*  We met in a Holiday Inn in Decatur, Alabama, when I first interviewed you in around 1990. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=11.88s)]
*  And then I became a local radio host in Huntsville, Alabama, and an emcee the night you became [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=18.32s)]
*  speaker. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=24.2s)]
*  That's how far we go back, and that's why you're my older brother. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=25.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=28.76s)]
*  This may have been the most cruel thing I've ever seen you do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=30.32s)]
*  You go from a live shot of Donald Trump surrounded by thousands of people hanging on his every [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=35.32s)]
*  word to the pathetic, chaotic, confused, clearly addled former vice president of the United [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  States, who on a good day could not do anything comparable to Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=50.24s)]
*  I mean, I watched. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=54.92s)]
*  I knew it was coming. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=55.92s)]
*  I knew you were going to do it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=57.4s)]
*  I did not realize we're going to go straight from Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=58.6s)]
*  And by the way, notice a lot of his speech was cultural. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=61.92s)]
*  It wasn't political. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=65.88s)]
*  It was about having faith in yourself. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=66.88s)]
*  It was about persevering. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=69.52s)]
*  It was about things that every young person should be learning. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=70.52s)]
*  And that's why I think Trump will be historically far more than just a political figure, because [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=74.48s)]
*  he's moving us back to the core values that America would grow out of. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=80.2s)]
*  It was a very good speech. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  And really, come on, Sean, to bring her and the elephants. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  I Googled the elephants today in preparation for coming on tonight. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  And I urge everybody watching, Google the elephants and say to yourself, how could that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=98.68s)]
*  woman, and I don't mean that as a pejorative, how could the vice president, I want people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=104.28s)]
*  to attack me. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=109.4s)]
*  How could the vice president bring that into the speech as though it made any sense? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was goofy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=119.28s)]
*  It was beyond. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=121.36000000000001s)]
*  I remember I used to be the emcee when you'd give a speech. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  About three minutes before I would be introducing you on a day somewhere, you would ask me all [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=126.4s)]
*  the time if I had a Sharpie and a pen and on a cloth napkin, this was you, three minutes [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  before you'd speak, you'd write down two, three, four things. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=137.72s)]
*  And that was your speech. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=141.08s)]
*  You'd throw it on the podium. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=142.52s)]
*  And I learned in that moment that, you know what, you got to learn to be able to speak [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=143.52s)]
*  extemporaneously from your heart. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=147.24s)]
*  President Trump does a lot of extemporaneous speaking. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's very clear. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=152.6s)]
*  I really want, I got a little preview about poll numbers that are coming out tomorrow [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=153.96s)]
*  and from both Robert Cahaly and Matt Towery, who I respect a lot. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  And as I suspected, all of the polls that the media has been pushing on the American [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  people about Donald Trump are false. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=171.0s)]
*  And that's what the early indications are. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  And that all the pollsters that got the election in 24 wrong and got every election about Donald [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=176.56s)]
*  Trump wrong, all of those people, the ones that say, oh, he's plummeting. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=183.76s)]
*  But meanwhile, they're ignoring, Chuck is at 17 percent and the Democrats are in the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=189.0s)]
*  20s. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm trying to understand that logic. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Can you help me out? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=196.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, first of all, they're just plain lying. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=198.56s)]
*  And I think we've got to be tougher and clearer about how dishonest these people are. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=200.72000000000003s)]
*  The fact is, and I talked to John McLaughlin and I talked to Matt Towery about this, they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  have some polls there that are like 27 percent Republican when Trump got 50 percent of the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  vote. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=216.12s)]
*  So if you add the 23 points they didn't test, suddenly he's in great shape. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=217.12s)]
*  This is deliberate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=221.88s)]
*  It is willful. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=222.88s)]
*  Look, there are three great centers of resistance, the propaganda media, which will lie all the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=223.88s)]
*  time, the fake district judges and the fake Congressional Budget Office. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=229.84s)]
*  Those are the last three great centers of resistance. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=235.04s)]
*  And they're going to do anything they can to defeat Trump and the Republicans, including [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=238.04s)]
*  lying about virtually everything. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=242.4s)]
*  Well, I know there have been three waves of conservatism really in our lifetime. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=244.12s)]
*  The Reagan Revolution, Newt Gingrich, when you were speaker, you were the last speaker [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  to balance the budget. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=255.48s)]
*  And it's amazing Democrats think it's a constitutional crisis to eliminate waste, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  fraud, abuse and corruption. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=260.88s)]
*  Oh, you know, one hundred and fifty billion dollars in radical Green New Deal, woke transgender [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=262.44s)]
*  madness abroad, which is insane. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=268.28s)]
*  And now it's on a whole new level. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=271.52s)]
*  And that is Donald Trump. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=274.12s)]
*  And it's America first. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=275.32s)]
*  And I see the establishment Washington institutionalists, just like with you, just like with Reagan, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=277.68s)]
*  they can't handle the shock and awe of somebody that thinks differently than the old established [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=285.04s)]
*  order. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=293.68s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=295.16s)]
*  Well, really quickly, one simple example. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  The Republican plan on Medicaid goes up every single year. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  Anyone who says it's being cut is a liar. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  And we have an obligation to say to their face, you are lying because the Republican [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  plan on Medicaid actually is an increase every year. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, I got to run. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you being with us, Newt Gingrich. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=319.56s)]
*  Great analysis tonight. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=321.24s)]
*  I agree with you totally about the president's speech. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0LcMYxG9NE&t=322.24s)]
