# ‘DESPICABLE’: Hugh Hewitt slams Dems for blaming Trump for a NATURAL disaster
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4)
*  Tonight, the facts are clear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service was fully staffed, and then some. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=1.8s)]
*  But that has not stopped top Democrats from perpetuating this anti-Trump smear. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=10.16s)]
*  What had just happened in Texas, the fact that they slashed the National Weather Service, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=11.16s)]
*  whether or not that was the direct proximate cause of those deaths, the fact that we're [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=16.64s)]
*  having that conversation is the issue. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=21.8s)]
*  The fact that we aren't sure is the problem. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=24.2s)]
*  And so we need to hold to what we deserve. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=27.08s)]
*  We should not be dissuaded, especially as black women, as women of color, as people [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  of color. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=34.92s)]
*  We should not be convinced that we don't have power. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=35.92s)]
*  They are mad at us for a reason. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  They're enough of us that we can change the outcome of elections, but also change the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=41.2s)]
*  outcome of power. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=45.12s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=46.8s)]
*  And even today, Eric Swalwell was still shamelessly politicizing this tragedy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=53.08s)]
*  I do think as lawmakers, we have a responsibility, though, to look at did cuts affect the ability [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=54.8s)]
*  for folks on the ground and at the camp to have an earlier, better warning? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  But this is really going to, should we just attack government for government's sake? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=67.62s)]
*  And for the last six months, we've seen an effort to undermine the hard work of government [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=72.72s)]
*  workers, whether it's air traffic controllers who keep planes from colliding in the air, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=77.64s)]
*  or FEMA first responders who go into the harshest hit places in America. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=82.02s)]
*  Here now with a reaction, Texas Congressman Wesley Hunt, Fox News contributor Hugh Hewitt, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=88.22s)]
*  and New Hampshire Senate candidate Scott Brown. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=93.06s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you for joining me tonight. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=95.82s)]
*  You served as a senator already, Scott Brown. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=99.06s)]
*  You're trying to get back there in New Hampshire now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=101.14s)]
*  You've been an ambassador. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=103.06s)]
*  You have faced these natural disasters, these tragedies before. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=104.6s)]
*  What is your advice to people across the aisle, Democrats? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=107.86s)]
*  Well, yes, we had the White Island volcano tragedy in New Zealand, the Christchurch massacre, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=112.06s)]
*  of course. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=115.9s)]
*  But listen, Stacey Abrams is a liar, misrepresenting the facts. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=116.9s)]
*  And her rhetoric and rhetoric, like other people on the left and Democrats, respectfully, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=120.5s)]
*  is going to lead to somebody getting killed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=125.78s)]
*  If you remember, it's almost a year ago that President Trump was almost assassinated, and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=128.02s)]
*  people lost their lives in Butler. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=132.98s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=135.38s)]
*  You know, the rhetoric is continuing and continuing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=136.38s)]
*  You saw what happened in Texas, an ambush for some of our ICE people, personnel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=139.02s)]
*  It's completely unacceptable, and people are going to die. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=145.34s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, it's not right, and they have to stop because you see the Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=148.86s)]
*  derangement syndrome. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=154.38s)]
*  We've already talked about it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=155.5s)]
*  They're about to elect a communist mayor in New York City. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=156.62s)]
*  I mean, it just goes on and on and on, and it's completely upside down. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  And respectfully, Kellyanne, that's why I'm running, because not only Chris Pappas, but [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=163.02s)]
*  every other Democrat. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  Have you heard anybody, like you asked Senator Britt, have you asked anybody on the Democratic [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  side to, like, help and join President Trump? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=174.86s)]
*  Have they said anything positive? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  I haven't heard it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=178.78s)]
*  No, it's terrible. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=179.78s)]
*  And Hugh, last time we joined each other on this show, you were willing to call Zoran [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=181.82s)]
*  Mondami an anti-Semite because she studied his record. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=186.34s)]
*  Are you willing to call Stacey Abrams and Eric Swalwell and the rest of these clowns [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=189.1s)]
*  liars? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=192.46s)]
*  Their facts are not on their side when it comes to the cuts and the National Weather [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  Service and whose fault this was. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=197.02s)]
*  It was a terrible tragedy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  Are they lying? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=200.34s)]
*  That's an easy call to make. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=201.34s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=204.86s)]
*  I could not actually believe the Stacey Abrams clip. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=205.86s)]
*  I went back and watched the entire 10-minute interview she did. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=208.46s)]
*  On the Jimmy Kimmel show, there was a guest host. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=212.06s)]
*  I believe his name is Anthony Anderson. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  And she spent 10 minutes with Pablum. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=216.56s)]
*  She's not dumb. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=219.38s)]
*  She went to Yale Law School. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=220.38s)]
*  She knows what proximate cause is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=221.48000000000002s)]
*  She wedged this attack on the National Weather Service into a book tour promotion. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=223.28s)]
*  It's despicable. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=229.04s)]
*  It's below despicable. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=230.04s)]
*  She hit the floor and she fell off of it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=231.04s)]
*  There is the occasion when a government responds to a natural disaster falls short. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=233.12s)]
*  East Palestine, Ohio, for example, or eastern, western North Carolina two years ago after [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=238.56s)]
*  the floods there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=243.84s)]
*  Governments can flub it when they don't respond correctly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=245.28s)]
*  of a natural disaster is by definition a natural disaster. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=250.2s)]
*  I talked to Chip Roy on my program today, the congressman who represents the 21st district. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=254.92s)]
*  His heart is broken. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=259.8s)]
*  He's down there on the ground. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=260.8s)]
*  His first ask was for people to help the Salvation Army or the Community Fund. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=262.08s)]
*  And his second ask, from the middle of the zone where the grieving is most intense, was [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=266.44s)]
*  please don't politicize this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=271.52s)]
*  What Eric Swalwell did, and it's expected from him, and what Stacey Abrams did, and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=274.02s)]
*  it's expected from her, is whatever would get them on television or sell books, respectively. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=278.04s)]
*  It's despicable. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=283.68s)]
*  It's got to end. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=284.92s)]
*  I don't think it's going to anytime soon. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=285.92s)]
*  But the more that we call out despicable conduct is just that, the better off we are. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  Yes, in addition to despicable and lying, Congressman Hunt, what do you expect from [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  President Trump's visit to Texas? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=300.12s)]
*  I know he's very careful to not get in the way of rescue and recovery. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  He has said that many times. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=307.04s)]
*  But here is a president who went right to where the fires had happened in L.A. after [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=308.24s)]
*  he and the First Lady Melania Trump just new to the job in the second term, went to North [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=314.32s)]
*  Carolina to meet with the folks who still had not recovered from the devastating natural [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=319.88s)]
*  disaster there from months before because Biden fell down on the job. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=325.0s)]
*  But what's your advice? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you're somebody that we look toward for leadership. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  You vote in the House. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=333.24s)]
*  What do you expect from President Trump? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=334.24s)]
*  What do you want to hear? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=335.88s)]
*  What do you tell your Democratic colleagues tonight, including Eric Swalwell? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  I just came from a vigil a couple of hours ago. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=342.08s)]
*  There are two families that attend my daughter's high school and the high school that I attended, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=343.88s)]
*  the Bellows family and the Gatton family. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=348.48s)]
*  My prayers are with you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=350.24s)]
*  My heart is with you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=351.76s)]
*  And we mourn your loss. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=352.88s)]
*  We mourn the loss of everyone that lost one of their babies in this tragic natural disaster. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=354.68s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=359.36s)]
*  This has absolutely nothing to do with politics. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=360.7s)]
*  It has nothing to do with with political party. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=363.2s)]
*  What we're going to see from President Trump is the exact opposite that we saw from the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=365.88s)]
*  ridiculousness of Stacey Abrams. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=369.84s)]
*  We're going to see compassion. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  We're going to see him meeting with families. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=373.08s)]
*  We're going to see him figure out ways to help to the best of his ability. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=374.76s)]
*  And by the way, he has already been over backwards to help in every way by lending all aid possible [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=378.56s)]
*  from the federal government to rectify this issue to the best of our abilities. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=383.55999999999995s)]
*  My heart goes out to those first responders that are risking their lives every single [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=387.23999999999995s)]
*  day to recover these bodies so that we can have some closure. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=391.4s)]
*  The families here in Texas are hurting. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=395.44s)]
*  We are hurting. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=397.88s)]
*  This is not about politics. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=399.0s)]
*  And Democrats are literally showing their hand as we speak. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=400.67999999999995s)]
*  I do not want to hear them lecture me on decency when they cannot sit down and pray for the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=403.84s)]
*  people of Texas and pray for those that lost their loved ones. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  I love the fact that President Trump is coming here to Texas. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=414.08s)]
*  I will be there with him. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=416.4s)]
*  And I can guarantee you he will bring the American spirit with him, the spirit of compassion. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=417.76s)]
*  Gentlemen, in the time we have left, I'll go in the same order. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=424.52s)]
*  Ambassador, Senator Brown, when you think about your race and people say, well, it's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=428.12s)]
*  always the economy or it's immigration, what do you think about these cultural issues? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=433.04s)]
*  What do you think about just the sort of attitude and posture, the hysteria, the lack of compassion [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=436.92s)]
*  of the Democratic Party? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=441.0s)]
*  Can you actually knit that into what you're doing as a candidate on the campaign? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=442.0s)]
*  Does it matter enough to people? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=446.48s)]
*  Well, I already see it now. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=449.04s)]
*  I mean, whether you have the open borders, the sanctuary cities, the men and boys and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=450.44s)]
*  women and girls sports, I mean, there's a complete upside down situation happening in [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=454.64s)]
*  New Hampshire where we have the New Hampshire advantage that's being attacked by our delegation. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=459.56s)]
*  And I'm presuming it's the same way throughout the country, where you're putting more taxes, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=464.28s)]
*  more regulations, a whole host of things that make it more difficult. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=467.56s)]
*  And thank God President Trump did his job. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=470.84s)]
*  He closed the border. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  Thank goodness he's doing his jobs. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=475.23999999999995s)]
*  He's streamlining and consolidating a lot of these government agencies that need to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=477.08s)]
*  be modernized. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  So I'm thankful that obviously that he's going to go down there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=483.64s)]
*  I'm so thankful, as was just said, for all of our first responders. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=487.52s)]
*  I mean, that Coast Guard's, I mean, unbelievable. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  God bless him. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=494.96s)]
*  He should get the Medal of Honor, quite frankly. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=495.96s)]
*  Hugh, is there a single Democratic guest you've had on recently or you can think of who would [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=498.4s)]
*  stand in the breach and distinguish himself or herself from the party right now in this? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=504.04s)]
*  I would hope Chris Coons would. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=509.72s)]
*  I think Chris is a wonderful man. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=511.48s)]
*  Scott served with him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=513.2s)]
*  I'm sure that he would agree with me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=514.28s)]
*  He's a wonderful man. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=516.2s)]
*  I haven't heard him yet, but I'm sure there are other Democrats who are as embarrassed [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=517.2s)]
*  by Eric Swalwell and Stacey Abrams as we four are, because that was, that's the low end [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=520.72s)]
*  of the party. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=525.88s)]
*  There are some people in the party that are decent. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=526.88s)]
*  I think Chris would be one of them. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  Let's hear from him, though. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  Justin Hunt, if some of your Democratic colleagues called you and said, hey, I'd like to come [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=533.56s)]
*  because we're all mourning and tragedy binds us all, would they be welcomed? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=537.4799999999999s)]
*  Would you want to see them there? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  And can you think of any actually approaching you thusly? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  I would love to see them there and I would welcome them with open arms. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  And I also want to say one more thing about Stacey Abrams' ridiculous comments. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=550.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, I've been black too my entire life, and when this incident happened, the last [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=554.16s)]
*  thing I thought about was the color of someone's skin. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=557.5999999999999s)]
*  I thought about these American babies that lost their lives. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=559.7199999999999s)]
*  And so she should be ashamed of herself. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=562.76s)]
*  We must condemn it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=564.72s)]
*  And I welcome any Democrat that will join us on Friday to mourn the loss of the lives [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=565.72s)]
*  of these babies. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=569.88s)]
*  Let's see if they show up and they put up instead of just speaking up. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=570.88s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you very much. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNlRMVfAQ4&t=574.04s)]
