# Dems spew ‘VILLAINOUS’ rhetoric on ‘HEROIC’ ICE agents: Stephen Miller
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=0.0s)]
*  Anti-ICE rhetoric on the left is getting worse by the day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=4.3s)]
*  And now on CNN, Tiffany Cross becomes the latest liberal talking head to compare immigration [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=7.82s)]
*  agents to Nazis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=13.64s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=15.96s)]
*  We are normalizing a government agency disappearing people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=16.96s)]
*  We are normalizing, we're talking about it like it's no big deal that they are kidnapping [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=20.76s)]
*  people and transporting them to concentration camps, both domestic and foreign. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=25.32s)]
*  Sadly, it's not just rhetoric. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  ICE agents are now physically under attack as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=33.8s)]
*  Whether it's in San Francisco, as you see on your screen, or in Texas, where officers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=36.76s)]
*  were ambushed on the 4th of July. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=41.64s)]
*  According to Chris Cuomo, it's time for Democrats to stop demonizing ICE before more people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=44.44s)]
*  get hurt. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=51.04s)]
*  But elected Democrats aren't slowing down. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=52.44s)]
*  They're now pushing a plan to force ICE agents to wear identifying badges. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=54.8s)]
*  That would leave them vulnerable to doxing and attacks from violent transnational gangs. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=59.019999999999996s)]
*  Here now with more is White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Homeland Security Advisor, and forever [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=64.52s)]
*  one of my favorite colleagues from the first term, Stephen Miller. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=70.06s)]
*  Stephen, it should not be an occupational hazard for our ICE agents, our brave men and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=74.32s)]
*  women, to go to work every day to try to protect citizens by deporting violent criminals, to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=78.8s)]
*  face violence themselves. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=84.2s)]
*  And do you see a nexus between the violent fighting words on the left from Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=86.28s)]
*  from Monica MacGyver, from Jayapel and others, and what's happening to our ICE agents? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=92.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's great to be here with you, my friend. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=97.84s)]
*  I always enjoy this chance to talk. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=102.88s)]
*  And I just wish it wasn't about such a somber topic, because you're right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  The rhetoric from Hakeem Jeffries, the rhetoric from Democrat leadership, the record from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=110.16s)]
*  that awful guest that you just played on CNN, this is eliminationist rhetoric. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  This is rhetoric that is used to justify violence, that is used to justify terrorism, that has [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=121.0s)]
*  directly led to, has directly inspired enormous assaults, a 700 percent increase in assaults [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=128.06s)]
*  on ICE officers and, of course, recent attempts at murder against ICE officers, including [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=137.6s)]
*  in Texas, where you had a shootout at, in this case, a Border Patrol facility that, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=143.64s)]
*  again, is inspired by this hateful, odious, villainous rhetoric. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's be very clear. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=153.88s)]
*  ICE officers are saving with their actions tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=155.32s)]
*  American lives. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=161.6s)]
*  Border Patrol and ICE are getting fentanyl and drugs out of our communities. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=162.92s)]
*  They just did an operation recently in Minneapolis that swept up a dozen child sex offenders, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=167.0s)]
*  child predators and pedophiles. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=172.96s)]
*  They are removing foreign terrorist organizations from our country, like Trin de Aragua, MS-13, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=176.08s)]
*  six Mexican drug cartels. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  They are fighting, they are battling every single day on the street, the most violent, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=184.44s)]
*  evil, ruthless criminal organizations on the face of planet Earth, organizations whose [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=189.72s)]
*  stock and trade is rape and murder. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  ICE officers are not only heroes, but they are among the bravest Americans among us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  Every day they go out onto the street knowing they face the threat of murder, knowing they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=205.2s)]
*  face the threat of doxing, knowing the hateful smears against them and their family, the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=209.22s)]
*  risk to their lives and their liberty, and yet they continue to press forward to do what? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  To save this country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=219.32s)]
*  Every American should be endlessly grateful to the men and women of ICE for what they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=221.18s)]
*  are doing of what President Trump is doing to liberate America. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=225.24s)]
*  And Stephen, so well said. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=229.36s)]
*  And also we're endlessly grateful now because of the big, beautiful bill. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=230.94s)]
*  We're going to have, I believe, up to 10,000 additional ICE agents and the funding. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHP-3awnxZc&t=234.82s)]
