# Mike Johnson: This is a threat to the rule of law
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson is here with the latest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=0.0s)]
*  What's the update on the attempt to stop this? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=2.64s)]
*  Although the Corps was pretty clear, they did take a strong stand against judge shopping [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=6.16s)]
*  because of the venue they went to when the plaintiffs were fromâ€”what, they were from [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=10.84s)]
*  Texas, they went to D.C. for a more liberal judge. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=14.68s)]
*  Yeah, they put it on raw display that venue shopping that Stephen Miller was talking about [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=18.12s)]
*  earlier is a serious problem. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=22.96s)]
*  And so are activist judges, liberal judges with a political bent. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=24.6s)]
*  It's a threat to the rule of law, to our entire system of justice, to equal justice, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=29.64s)]
*  to the separation of powers and all of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=34.6s)]
*  And desperate times call for desperate measures. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=36.6s)]
*  So we're delighted with the Supreme Court ruling. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=38.68s)]
*  It is a big one. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=41.36s)]
*  As was described earlier, it's exactly right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  And we're going to move on it in Congress as well. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=45.16s)]
*  So this week, Sean, we'll be putting on the floor Congressman Darrell Issa's bill, the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  No Rogue Rulings Act. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=51.68s)]
*  And what this is going to do is keep federal district court judges in their constitutional [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=53.32s)]
*  lane. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=58.16s)]
*  One single activist judge should be able to issue a nationwide injunction to stop a president's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=59.68s)]
*  policies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=64.72s)]
*  That's not the way the framers intended this to work, and we're going to put them back [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=65.72s)]
*  in check. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=68.6s)]
*  OK, so let's go to the issue of reconciliation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=69.6s)]
*  You got what you wanted, one big, beautiful bill, right, that's going to take place. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=75.84s)]
*  Now, and you got a big boost last week, because Lindsey Graham, as the Senate budget chair, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=80.12s)]
*  believes, and it worked that they can bypass any commentary or input from the Senate parliamentarian [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=86.48s)]
*  when it comes to issues of spending. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=93.12s)]
*  With all of that said, in that other body, the Senate, they have more arcane-like rules [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=95.28s)]
*  that make it very difficult in terms of passing reconciliation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=101.4s)]
*  That means that your members in the House, with your now larger majority, but still slim, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=105.76s)]
*  they're going to have to go along with the rules in the Senate if they're going to want [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=112.04s)]
*  this thing to get through, which the president desperately wants through. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=115.56s)]
*  There was talk about a fracture within the caucus. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  What's the latest? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=122.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's a pretty good summary of the situation, Sean. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=123.32s)]
*  We are hemmed in some ways by the sometimes archaic rules of the Senate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=126.24s)]
*  We got to play by those rules to achieve our mission, and that is to deliver the America [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=130.88s)]
*  First agenda. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=134.64s)]
*  So where we are procedurally, not to get too deep in the weeds, is that the House passed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=135.64s)]
*  our budget resolution. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=139.96s)]
*  We sent it over to the Senate. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=141.8s)]
*  They've amended somewhat. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  They kept all of our provisions in, but they added their own, and now they've sent it back [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=145.28s)]
*  over. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=148.86s)]
*  We've got to pass that, the Senate amendment, so that we can get to the next stage. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=149.86s)]
*  The next stage in the process to deliver on President Trump's America First agenda is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=154.02s)]
*  to get to the point we've all been waiting on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  We've been working on this in the House for over a year, to get to this point, to draft [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=160.26s)]
*  the actual reconciliation bill. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=164.26s)]
*  And in that bill, Sean, we're going to do, the reason the president calls it the one [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=166.38s)]
*  big beautiful bill is because we're going to deliver on all these promises we made to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=169.28s)]
*  the people, all the America First policies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  We're going to restore the border, make sure we have the funding to do that well and right [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=176.18s)]
*  and permanently. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=179.9s)]
*  Sean, we're going to add American energy dominance provisions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=180.9s)]
*  We're going to make sure we restore peace through strength, put in all the funding mechanisms [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=183.9s)]
*  to handle that and follow through with the president's orders, while also incorporating [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  what DOJ is doing to make government work more efficiently and effectively. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=192.0s)]
*  And most importantly, Sean, maybe equally important to all that, is that we're going [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=195.88s)]
*  to make sure we don't have the largest tax increase in U.S. history at the end of this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=199.10000000000002s)]
*  year, which is what would happen by default if the president's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  from the first administration expire, which is what will happen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  So all that will be moving forward, but we have to keep the House and Senate Republicans [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  working together as one team. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=213.66s)]
*  We unify. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=215.62s)]
*  We will accomplish this mission. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=216.62s)]
*  What are the biggest criticisms of the current version that came out of the Senate? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=218.3s)]
*  Well we're having a lot of discussion in the House and the Senate, in between the two chambers, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=225.78s)]
*  about how to achieve the objective, because we want to do all those things I just outlined, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  but we also want to make sure that we bend the trajectory on the nation's debt and the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  deficits. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  That's a really important principle. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  It's something that we need to send a message to the bond markets and the stock market, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=241.62s)]
*  investors, job creators, entrepreneurs and innovators, everybody who makes this economy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=245.94s)]
*  work, that Congress is serious about this, that we're not going to stay on this trajectory [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  that we're on that would bankrupt the country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=254.22s)]
*  The president is serious about checking all these boxes and making sure that we have real [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=256.46000000000004s)]
*  cuts and we show good fiscal stewardship of the people's resources. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=261.06s)]
*  That's what we're working on, finding the equilibrium is the catch. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=266.1s)]
*  Is it possible to have a second reconciliation bill for maybe unfinished business? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=269.62s)]
*  For example, reconciliation allows the Senate to only need 51 votes instead of cloture, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=274.54s)]
*  which would require 60 votes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=279.82000000000005s)]
*  Would there be another bite at the apple if you were to get this one passed? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there will be. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for pointing that out, because we'll get as much of this done in this package as [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=288.5s)]
*  we can, and then there'll be another bite at the apple for the next fiscal year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=292.14000000000004s)]
*  So you can do a reconciliation bill for each of those fiscal years, and that's what the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  plan is. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=301.22s)]
*  Remember, all of this is working together. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=302.22s)]
*  We want to have a reconciliation package to check all these boxes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=303.74s)]
*  We also want to have a thoughtful 12-bill FY26 appropriations process that reflects [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=307.1s)]
*  all the savings that Doge and the Trump administration are finding and the new revenue streams. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  And to do this in a fiscally responsible manner. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  We're also going to be dealing with some rescissions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=320.26000000000005s)]
*  I know we're talking about archaic procedural mechanisms, but that is basically what happens [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  when the White House sends to Congress a request to cut more spending, to claw it back. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  So all these things will be happening, Sean, and I think the outcome is going to be great. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  What do you plan for the fiscal year that begins October 1? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=336.62s)]
*  Are you planning to have the budgets done and voted on and up and running by October [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=339.58s)]
*  1, this coming fiscal year? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=346.3s)]
*  The fiscal year starting in Washington? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah, we are. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=350.94s)]
*  And I know that sounds like a big leap, but if we get reconciliation done... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=352.18s)]
*  Like a pipe dream? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=355.46s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=356.46s)]
*  Knowing the history. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=357.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=358.46s)]
*  We're fiercely committed to getting back to regular order. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=359.46s)]
*  We're already behind the eight ball because it takes several months to do it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=362.62s)]
*  I'm optimistic we'll push it through. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  We'll get the agenda done. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=368.34s)]
*  Alright, Speaker Johnson, we appreciate you being with us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unHU_7Y04lY&t=369.62s)]
