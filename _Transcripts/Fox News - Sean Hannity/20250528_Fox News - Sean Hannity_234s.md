# ‘SHADOW’ GOVERNMENT?: Why Dems are the ‘true threat to democracy’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw)
*  We have more on that straight ahead, but first tonight, the walls are closing in on the Democrats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=0.0s)]
*  and the state-run legacy media mob as more and more evidence shows up that they help cover up [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=5.04s)]
*  Joe Biden's cognitive decline. And guess what? Who knew what? What did they know? When did they [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=11.68s)]
*  know it? And who was really in charge the last four years? Every one of you deserves answers to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=17.52s)]
*  all of those questions and more. Now, thankfully, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=25.279999999999998s)]
*  he is working to get those answers. Last week, Chairman Comer sent letters to Biden's former [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=30.64s)]
*  White House physician, Kevin O'Connor, as well as four top senior aides demanding that they appear [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=36.0s)]
*  for transcribed interviews. Now, Comer alleges that all of these staffers work behind the scenes [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=42.56s)]
*  to run interference, to hide just how bad Joe Biden's decline was from the American public, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  last week, he told Fox News that unelected bureaucrats had an overwhelming influence on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=55.44s)]
*  Biden and were possibly even serving as the de facto president. And this is just the tip of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=61.36s)]
*  the iceberg. A pro-energy group, Power the Future, they are now demanding answers on the alleged use [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=66.88s)]
*  of the auto pen, saying that there's no evidence that Biden knew about several climate executive [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  orders he allegedly signed. In particular, the group says executive orders banning Arctic drill [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=78.56s)]
*  committing the federal government to net zero emissions by 2050, mandating clean energy AI centers [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=85.44s)]
*  and banning offshore drilling should be deemed null and void due to the use of auto pen and no [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  public comment from Biden confirming any knowledge of it at the time or since. Now, we need congressional [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=98.72s)]
*  hearings, we need more information, we need answers, and people need to be held responsible [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  for what is now quickly becoming the biggest White House political scandal of our lifetime. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=110.16s)]
*  Maybe we should call it dementia gate, but somehow Democrats still don't seem to get it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=116.96s)]
*  Remember, back in March, failed vice presidential candidate Tim Walz. He wanted to shadow government [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=122.32s)]
*  to counter the Trump administration. You might recall. Take a look. I've been saying this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=127.92s)]
*  I think we need to shadow government so when all these things come up every single day, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=133.92s)]
*  we've got an alternate press conference telling the truth about what things are happening. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=138.56s)]
*  Ah, democracy in peril, a shadow government, alternate press conferences. Sounds like a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=143.44s)]
*  blatant attempt to subvert the will of the American people. Now, not to be outdone, though, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=148.72s)]
*  Politico is now fantasizing about what a shadow Democratic cabinet would even look like, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=153.84s)]
*  which includes, and you can't make it up, Giselle Federman, Nikki Glaser, the comedian, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=159.04s)]
*  John Stewart, the comedian, Letitia James and others. That's more akin to like an Orwellian [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=164.4s)]
*  nightmare than a legitimate cabinet. And what about this Broadway star, Patty Lepone, who [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=170.32s)]
*  allegedly told The New Yorker that the Kennedy Center should, quote, get blown up? How is that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=177.12s)]
*  not a threat? Remember, Madonna said, I think, an awful lot about blowing up the White House. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=184.32s)]
*  If Democrats want to find the true threat to democracy, they just need to look in the mirror [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=188.88s)]
*  because it's kind of hard to imagine a bigger threat to our Democratic Republic, or democracy, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=193.84s)]
*  as they say, than a group of unelected bureaucrats allegedly taking advantage of a obviously [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=200.0s)]
*  cognitively struggling president to implement their own radical left wing agenda. The very people [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=206.96s)]
*  that tried to tell you Donald Trump is a threat to democracy were actually the real threat [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=214.56s)]
*  themselves. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNjy2J5xBMw&t=220.64s)]
