# This is who Democrats are protecting: Hannity
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight there is one person who got paid to lie for Joe Biden at the White House and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=7.4s)]
*  then got paid even more to lie on his behalf on MSDNC. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  And now circle back, Jen Psaki is trying to rewrite history after enthusiastically endorsing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=16.36s)]
*  Biden's mental and physical fitness for years. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=22.56s)]
*  We're going to take you down memory lane and we'll circle back later with a message [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  for Jen Psaki. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=29.66s)]
*  Plus, I regret to inform you, Michelle Obama is once again complaining about the burden [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=31.1s)]
*  of living in the White House. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=36.82s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=38.3s)]
*  It's expensive to live in the White House. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  As many people don't know, I mean, much is not covered. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=41.94s)]
*  You're paying for every food, every bit of food that you eat. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=46.78s)]
*  You know, you're not paying for housing and the staff in it, but everything, even travel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=50.1s)]
*  Well, today we'll analyze their finances just a little bit and see if it was worth their [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=56.3s)]
*  while. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=60.22s)]
*  Jimmy Fela also will respond in our other news of the day segment. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=61.22s)]
*  And stay tuned, a Hannity event announcement. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=65.38s)]
*  I think you'll like it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=69.7s)]
*  But first, our top story, promises made, promises kept. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=70.7s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=73.86s)]
*  Border crossings are at their lowest level ever recorded. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=74.86s)]
*  Is the borderâ€” [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=80.1s)]
*  Is that good? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=81.1s)]
*  Is the border now secure? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=82.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's really secure. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=83.1s)]
*  It's absolutely secure. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=84.41999999999999s)]
*  Isn't that good that when you say that, doesn't that just sound good? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=85.41999999999999s)]
*  After being abused for years by an incompetent president that allowed people to pour through [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=88.02s)]
*  an open border, criminals from all over the world, murderers and insane people from mental [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=92.74s)]
*  institutions and insane asylums. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=98.3s)]
*  Isn't it a beautiful thing when you say, it's the most secure it's ever been in the history [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=100.5s)]
*  of our country? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=107.02s)]
*  Isn't that a nice statement? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=108.02s)]
*  I would have liked to have heard her answer. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=110.13999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, they said it would never happen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=111.78s)]
*  Now, not only is the border secure, but NBC News is, well, for once, allowing the president [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=113.78s)]
*  to tell the truth. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=119.33999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, Democrats either open the border on purpose or they are the most incompetent [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  people to ever walk the planet. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  This is the single most preventable national security disaster ever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=127.78s)]
*  But it's up to President Trump to clean up their mess. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=133.42s)]
*  And his work is only getting started with border crossings down to almost nothing, deportations [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=136.14s)]
*  on the rise. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=140.9s)]
*  The White House is getting creative. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=141.9s)]
*  A brand new program from the DHS now offering to buy a one-way plane ticket out of the U.S. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=143.26s)]
*  pay a thousand dollars to illegal immigrants willing to self-deport. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=150.7s)]
*  This initiative could save all of you billions and billions of dollars in court costs between [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  what we pay in education, health care, of course, the criminal justice system and other [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=162.62s)]
*  ICE related expenses. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=168.18s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=170.08s)]
*  President Trump also offering to help Mexico destroy the violent cartels now designated [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=171.4s)]
*  as terrorist organizations. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=176.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=178.84s)]
*  Mexico is saying that I offered to send U.S. troops into Mexico to take care of the cartels. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=179.84s)]
*  He wants to know, is that true? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=185.84s)]
*  Do you think I'm going to answer that question? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=187.84s)]
*  That's why I'm asking. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=189.84s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=191.84s)]
*  I will answer it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=192.84s)]
*  It's true. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=193.84s)]
*  President Trump is ready and willing to use all options to secure our country, protect [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=196.6s)]
*  all of you from fentanyl, gang violence, murder, rape and other heinous violent crimes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=201.32s)]
*  Now, naturally, Democrats are up in arms for whatever reason. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=206.96s)]
*  Apparently, they really don't want the border to be secured. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=210.4s)]
*  They don't want anyone deported, seemingly for any reason. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=213.06s)]
*  For weeks, Congresswoman AOC has been distributing materials on how to evade ICE and avoid deportation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=216.44s)]
*  Some have accused the Congresswoman of actually aiding and abetting and lawbreaking. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=224.11999999999998s)]
*  Doesn't seem to care. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=227.88s)]
*  She's now trying to taunt. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  Borders are. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=232.0s)]
*  Tom Homan. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=233.0s)]
*  Good luck in this fight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=234.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=235.0s)]
*  Tom Homan, then-Acting Director of ICE, said that he was going to threaten to refer me [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=236.0s)]
*  to DOJ because I'm using my free speech rights in order to advise people of their constitutionally [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=241.0s)]
*  guaranteed protection. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=248.0s)]
*  And he may want to do it again today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=249.0s)]
*  And to that I say, come for me. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=252.52s)]
*  Of course, liberals believe that illegals have constitutional rights. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=255.52s)]
*  Tom Homan has indeed referred the leader of the Democrats to the DOJ. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=259.4s)]
*  But as you can see, top Democrats, they continue to advocate for the rights of illegal immigrants [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=263.96s)]
*  over the safety of you and your family. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=269.28s)]
*  In fact, fake news CNN, who could never find the courage to investigate Biden's cognitive [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=271.24s)]
*  Just traveled all the way to a cartel hotspot in Western Mexico to come face to face with [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=277.58s)]
*  a member of the notorious Sinaloa cartel in order to ask him, how do you feel about being [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  labeled a terrorist organization by the Trump administration? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=291.06s)]
*  I wonder how he's feeling. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=294.9s)]
*  Let's look. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=296.62s)]
*  According to the Trump administration, you are a terrorist. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=297.62s)]
*  The cartels have been labeled a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=304.26s)]
*  What's your message to Donald Trump if he's watching this? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=306.58s)]
*  Unfortunately, thanks to the Biden administration, cartels have a serious foothold right here [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=313.58s)]
*  in this country, in the U.S. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=336.38s)]
*  activity across the country exploded thanks to the Democratic Party. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=339.22s)]
*  And here are just a few recent examples of what Americans deal with every single solitary [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=343.66s)]
*  day on Friday. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=348.3s)]
*  Several MS-13 gang members all locked up for violent crimes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=349.66s)]
*  They launched a coordinated attack at a Virginia state prison, brutally stabbing three correctional [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=353.98s)]
*  officers there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=360.3s)]
*  On Sunday, young members of Trend Day Aragwa assaulted a pair of NYPD officers in Times [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=361.98s)]
*  Square in New York City. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=367.58s)]
*  In California, three illegal immigrants were charged with a horrific murder. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=369.34s)]
*  They are accused of killing a man during a home invasion. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=373.85999999999996s)]
*  One of these suspected killers was facing two ICE detainers because of his criminal [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  record, but was shielded by California's sanctuary city policies. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=382.3s)]
*  Great job, Gavin. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=386.9s)]
*  This is who Democrats are protecting. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=388.12s)]
*  Not you, not your kids, not your grandkids, not law-abiding citizens. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=390.5s)]
*  They are protecting criminal, illegal aliens and fighting tooth and nail to keep them in [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=395.06s)]
*  your neighborhood. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzWSABknTs&t=399.64s)]
