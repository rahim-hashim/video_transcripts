# Stephen Miller reveals Trump admin's 'daily goal' for illegal migrant arrests
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs)
*  And Stephen Miller joins us now with more. All right, so you and Kristi Noma pushing for 3,000 a day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs&t=0.0s)]
*  But you're also going to fortify ice [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs&t=6.48s)]
*  I'm the one big beautiful bill. My understanding is with at least [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs&t=9.36s)]
*  147 billion dollars more for them to accomplish that goal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs&t=13.74s)]

*  single day [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs&t=35.120000000000005s)]

*  And we can't take the risk of letting these Biden illegals roam around freely [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs&t=42.28s)]
*  So the next American daughter can get raped the next American kid can get murdered the next American family can get splintered and torn apart [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJNXsOqFSZs&t=47.28s)]
