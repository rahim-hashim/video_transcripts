# Hannity and Stephen A. Smith spar over Trump tariffs
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs)
*  All right, without a clear leader or a sense of direction, the Democratic Party is obviously [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=0.0s)]
*  struggling. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=4.92s)]
*  They're even souring on their hero, former President Barack Obama. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=5.92s)]
*  Take a look at what our good friend Stephen A. Smith said about a hypothetical third term [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=9.92s)]
*  matchup between Obama and Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=14.96s)]
*  How ep- this is like right out of a Rocky movie, isn't it? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=17.28s)]
*  Anyway, hypothetical matchup. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=20.84s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=22.88s)]
*  As for him going up against Barack Obama, once upon a time I thought Barack Obama was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=23.88s)]
*  smoking. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=29.58s)]
*  I'm not so sure anymore. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=30.58s)]
*  It was Barack Obama that spoke on behalf of Kamala Harris. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=35.06s)]
*  Michelle Obama certainly put forth her due diligence in doing the same. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  Where did that get them? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=45.14s)]
*  They lost the popular vote, lost the Electoral College vote, lost every swing state, lost [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=47.5s)]
*  the Senate, lost the House. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  I mean, damn, it's elves all over the place. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  Remember, Obama was out campaigning for Kamala. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=56.46s)]
*  It seems like he's lost all influence and power in his own party. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=58.86s)]
*  According to a new book, Obama was allegedly working against Kamala behind the scenes in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=62.34s)]
*  November. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=66.98s)]
*  He wanted a mini primary after he was part of the coup to get rid of Joe. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=67.98s)]
*  Anyway, he didn't think she could win. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=72.18s)]
*  Could have to do something to do with his past, the vice of rhetoric. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=74.42s)]
*  You might recall he wasn't always the biggest fan of yours truly either. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=78.58s)]
*  Take a little trip down memory lane. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=82.9s)]
*  Everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=86.46s)]
*  And I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=89.66s)]
*  It's not surprising that they get better. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=92.86s)]
*  They cling to guns or religion or antipathy towards people who aren't like them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=95.86s)]
*  If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=102.58s)]
*  Somebody invested in roads and bridges. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=107.86s)]
*  If you got a business, you didn't build that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=109.41999999999999s)]
*  Somebody else made that happen. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  I want you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=114.98s)]
*  I want you to talk to them whether they're independent or whether they are Republican. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=118.46s)]
*  I want you to argue with them and get in their face. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=124.46s)]
*  We've got to have middle class families up in front. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=127.74s)]
*  We can't, we don't mind the Republicans joining us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=133.74s)]
*  They can go come for the ride, but they've got to sit in back. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=138.18s)]
*  And then you've got their plan, which is let's have dirtier air, dirtier water, less [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=143.38s)]
*  people with health insurance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=150.62s)]
*  Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al-Qaeda is a threat. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=151.62s)]
*  Because a few months ago, when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=155.54s)]
*  America, you said Russia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=159.14s)]
*  Not Al-Qaeda, you said Russia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=161.18s)]
*  Mr. Burgess, he can speak. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=162.9s)]
*  Put me on your stand. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=164.5s)]
*  I might have to put Mr. Burgess on Fox News. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, I'll give him... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=173.94s)]
*  I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=180.94s)]
*  He'll tear him up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=186.34s)]
*  He mentioned me a lot back in the day. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=189.34s)]
*  I'm so, such fond memories. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=191.34s)]
*  I'm here with Moore, star of ESPN's first take, host of the Stephen A. Smith show, the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=193.94s)]
*  one and only Stephen A. Smith. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=198.94s)]
*  You know what, man? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=200.94s)]
*  You interrupt my day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=201.94s)]
*  I don't even ask a question. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=202.94s)]
*  You go. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=203.94s)]
*  You interrupt my day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=204.94s)]
*  I come to the studio to see you. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=205.94s)]
*  You ain't even here, okay? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=206.94s)]
*  And then you got the audacity to put that out as divisive rhetoric on his part. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=207.94s)]
*  That's G-rated compared to the stuff that comes out of your mouth. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=208.94s)]
*  I mean, what hypocrisy? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=209.94s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=210.94s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=211.94s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=212.94s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=213.94s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=214.94s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=215.94s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=216.94s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=217.94s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=219.74s)]
*  I'm not voting for president. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=220.74s)]
*  I wish Donald Trump would tone it down. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=225.74s)]
*  They want dirty air and water. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=228.18s)]
*  Argue with him. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=230.06s)]
*  Get in their face. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=231.34s)]
*  Ask campaign, chatter man. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=232.34s)]
*  They can be on the bus. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=233.34s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=234.34s)]
*  They've got to sit in the back. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=235.34s)]
*  Oh, he was just loving. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=236.34s)]
*  You know, give peace a chance, man. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=238.34s)]
*  He was so uniting. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=240.3s)]
*  Well, listen, it wasn't about being united. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=242.1s)]
*  It was about winning, which is something the Democrats need to learn again because clearly [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=245.42s)]
*  They forgot how to do that, so let's get that out of the way. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=248.58s)]
*  And when I pointâ€” [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  That's an absolutely good point. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  Secondly, that sound that you played for me talking about Obama, that was from weeks ago, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=254.66000000000003s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  That wasn't since Trump with his tariff wars and all of this stuff. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=260.02000000000004s)]
*  Let me tell you something right now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=262.82s)]
*  OK, stop trying to change the subject. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=264.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm not changing the subject. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=265.82s)]
*  I'm right here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=266.82s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=267.82s)]
*  Here's my question. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=268.82s)]
*  Because if we're going to have this hypothetical matchup and we're going to go to the last [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=269.82s)]
*  which I thought was maybe one of the best. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=274.62s)]
*  I loved them all. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=276.98s)]
*  And you have this hypothetical matchup that probably a lot of people will be interested [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=279.18s)]
*  in. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  What do you really know about Barack Obama? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  What do youâ€”do you know who Frank Marshall Davis is? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=287.94s)]
*  I'm sure you know who Reverend Wright is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you know who Bernardine Dorn is? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=292.18s)]
*  Do you know who Bill Ayers is? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=294.46s)]
*  I know a few people that Trump associates with as well, so we could have that argument [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=296.3s)]
*  all day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=300.02s)]
*  I didn't ask you that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=301.02s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=302.02s)]
*  I'm answering your question. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  Here's my point. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  Don't come to me with that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  You said a fight, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=306.41999999999996s)]
*  Trump versus Obama, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=308.06s)]
*  Let's talk about that, and here's what I'm telling you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=309.85999999999996s)]
*  You know, there's a bunch of liberals in this country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=312.14s)]
*  There's a bunch of centrists in this country, a bunch of moderates, OK? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you've got the Republicans that would speak against the Affordable Care Act or American [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=317.5s)]
*  Recovery and Reinvestment Act. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=321.02s)]
*  They might speak against those things, but a lot of people on the left and a lot of centrists [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  like that stuff about Obama. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=325.46s)]
*  Here's my thing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=327.02s)]
*  With Trumpâ€”see, these times right nowâ€”this is what I keep trying to tell the Democratsâ€”they [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=328.46s)]
*  say, let the man do what he's doing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=332.98s)]
*  Find out whether or not it works. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=335.22s)]
*  You're going to listen to Sean Hannity. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=336.74s)]
*  There you go. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=337.74s)]
*  You're going to watch him. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=338.74s)]
*  Let's see if these terrorists against Canada, Mexico, China, for everybody that he's trying [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=339.74s)]
*  to, you know, be a reciprocatingâ€” [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=343.74s)]
*  Well, guess what's going to happen? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=344.74s)]
*  Engaging in a reciprocation. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=345.74s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=346.74s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=347.74s)]
*  If I punch you in the face, or we're business partners, and we're supposed to be 50-50 [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=348.74s)]
*  partners, and I take 75 percent and give you 25 percentâ€” [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=355.14000000000004s)]
*  I got a problem with that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=358.26s)]
*  You're just going to sit back and take that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=359.26s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith is just going to say, oh, it's okay, Sean, you take all the money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=361.58000000000004s)]
*  You're going to take that? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=366.38s)]
*  No. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=367.38s)]
*  But here's the point that I'm making to you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=368.38s)]
*  Why should America take it? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=369.38s)]
*  Well, I'm going to tell youâ€”I'm not telling you that America should just flat out take [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=370.38s)]
*  it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=373.86s)]
*  Sure, there should be a fight that's on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=374.86s)]
*  But how you engage in that fight, are you doing it adroitly? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=376.42s)]
*  Are you doing it smartly? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  We know manufacturing jobs have been being lost for decades. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  How do you doâ€”hold on. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=383.86s)]
*  Over 5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=384.86s)]
*  The age of AI, CHAT, GPT and all of that has come into effect. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=385.86s)]
*  Slow down. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=386.86s)]
*  Things have changed. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=387.86s)]
*  Because you're wrong. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=388.86s)]
*  What am I doing? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=389.86s)]
*  Since Donald Trump started making the tariff threat alone, we have nearly $5 trillion in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=391.18s)]
*  companies' investments. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=398.54s)]
*  Nissan, Honda, we're going to build plants in Mexico. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=399.54s)]
*  They're building them here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  $500 billion from Apple. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  Foreign countries are investing billions of dollars because they want to be here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  Other countries dropping their tariffs so they don't get tariffed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=412.42s)]
*  May I ask a question? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=416.06s)]
*  Sean Hannity, are there not folks on both the left and the right, American citizens [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=417.42s)]
*  now bringing up words like inflation, bringing up words like a potential recession, worried [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=422.3s)]
*  about the impact that tariffs are going to have on the American citizen for the immediate [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=427.14s)]
*  future? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=430.86s)]
*  You're right about the long haul. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=431.86s)]
*  You might be right about the long haul, but in short term, we can't ignore that either. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=433.38s)]
*  So we have two choices here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=436.62s)]
*  We continue to let countries screw us over and tariff us to death at rates that we don't [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=438.24s)]
*  tariff them at. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=444.98s)]
*  We just continue to take it like everybody else has taken it, or we draw a line in the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=446.1s)]
*  sand where the land of the free and the home of the brave and we say, it's your choice. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  If you put tariffs on us, we'll have to put them on you, or we can have free and fair [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=456.1s)]
*  trade. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=460.66s)]
*  It's up to the country to decide. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=461.66s)]
*  Tell me, Steve, what's unfair about that? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=463.58000000000004s)]
*  Listen, it's not a matter of it being unfair. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=465.82000000000005s)]
*  I'm not accusing the man of being unfair as it pertains to that particular issue. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=467.74s)]
*  By the way, I was listening to Lindsey Graham before I came on. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=470.86s)]
*  I actually like that, man. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=473.54s)]
*  Don't tell him, but I actually like that, man. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  But here's the deal, OK, Sean Hannity? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=476.5s)]
*  Don't tell him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=478.06s)]
*  Don't tell him that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=479.06s)]
*  Don't tell him that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=480.06s)]
*  He just told the world. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=481.06s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=482.06s)]
*  I mean, I just like how he comes at it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=483.06s)]
*  I don't agree with him after the time, but I like the way he comes at it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=485.02000000000004s)]
*  What I'm saying to you is this. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=487.74s)]
*  You just brought up a boxing analogy. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=488.90000000000003s)]
*  You can knock somebody out, or you can jab them to death, or you can rope or dope them. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=490.56s)]
*  There's a variety of ways that you can beat people in terms ofâ€”instead of doing it the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=494.74s)]
*  way that Trump is doing it, because he's upsetting everything. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=499.78000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=502.42s)]
*  Last question. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=503.42s)]
*  You know, he said somethingâ€” [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=505.38s)]
*  He's going to work. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=506.38s)]
*  He said something I want to applaud. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=507.38s)]
*  Let him put his policies in place. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=510.3s)]
*  Give it some time, a reasonable amount of time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=512.28s)]
*  It takes time toâ€”you know, you've got toâ€”the economy, you've got to get your plan fully [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=514.3000000000001s)]
*  passed and then give them a year, and then we'll come back and have that conversation [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=520.1s)]
*  or a year and a half. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=524.34s)]
*  Well, at least you said a year. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=525.34s)]
*  At least you saidâ€”yeah, I don't know if this would be that long. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=526.34s)]
*  But now, the verdict is in on Obamacare. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=527.34s)]
*  Now, they promised that everyone would keep their doctor, keep their plan, and the average [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=529.1s)]
*  family would save $2,500 a year. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=534.82s)]
*  Here's the numbers. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=537.62s)]
*  You ready? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=538.62s)]
*  Millions lost their doctors. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=539.62s)]
*  Millions lost their plans. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=541.7s)]
*  The average cost is overâ€”on average, 250 to 300 percent higher than it was before Obamacare, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=544.62s)]
*  and about 40-plus percent of the country has one Obamacare exchange option. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=552.16s)]
*  I would say F, F, F, and F. It's failed and failed miserably, and it absolutely was a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=557.34s)]
*  disaster. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=564.7s)]
*  That's my grade. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=565.7s)]
*  What's yours? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=566.7s)]
*  I would say I'll get you when you're on my show, but you do the same damn thing on [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=567.7s)]
*  my show. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=570.9s)]
*  You don't even give me a chance to answer a question or even ask a question. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=571.9s)]
*  I'm giving you a chance. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=573.9s)]
*  It's what you do. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=574.9s)]
*  It's what you do. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=575.9s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=576.9s)]
*  Are there not tens of millions of Americans using the Affordable Care Act and a lot of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=577.9s)]
*  them in southern states? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=580.9s)]

*  Is that not true? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=582.9s)]
*  Is that not true? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=583.9s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=584.9s)]
*  They're not saving money. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=585.9s)]
*  True or false? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  True or false? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=588.5799999999999s)]
*  Did they promise millions that you wouldn't lose your doctor? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=589.5799999999999s)]
*  Do millions lose it? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=592.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=593.14s)]
*  Did millions lose their plans? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=594.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=595.42s)]
*  Do millions of Americans only have one option? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=596.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=598.86s)]
*  Are they paying 250 percent more? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=599.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=601.5s)]
*  Every promise broken. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=602.5s)]
*  So millions benefited and millions didn't. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=603.5s)]

*  I'm so surprised. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=608.1s)]
*  I'm so surprised. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=609.1s)]
*  Everybody's not pleased. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=610.1s)]
*  That's not what they said. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=611.1s)]
*  They didn't say it was for some people, not for other people. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=612.1s)]
*  They said you're going to save $2,500 a year. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=613.98s)]
*  It's going to be the greatest system ever. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=616.98s)]
*  It's not. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDFjWMQxLbs&t=619.62s)]
