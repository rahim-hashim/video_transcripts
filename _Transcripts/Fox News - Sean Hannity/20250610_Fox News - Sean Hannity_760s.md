# Newsom MUST answer this question about anti-ICE riots
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg)
*  Police breaking for another night of chaos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=0.0s)]
*  But first, we need to step back. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=2.4s)]
*  We need to remember what these riots are all about. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=4.68s)]
*  Now, first, we had Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and, of course, Alejandro Mayorkas and every [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=7.76s)]
*  Democrat telling us the border is closed, the border is secure, they lied to us for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=13.6s)]
*  four years, anywhere between 12 and 20 million unvetted illegals, including known terrorists. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=17.66s)]
*  We have Iranian assassination squads in the country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=24.6s)]
*  We have cartel members. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=27.6s)]
*  We have gang members. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=28.7s)]
*  We have murderers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=29.7s)]
*  We have rapists. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=30.7s)]
*  We have other violent criminals. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=31.7s)]
*  Started there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=32.7s)]
*  Then, of course, ICE, in this case, is doing the job of getting rid of these people that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=33.7s)]
*  Joe and Kamala and others allowed in the country, and, of course, the safe haven created by [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=38.86s)]
*  cities and states like California, cities like Los Angeles. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=43.4s)]
*  And ICE conducted an operation in Los Angeles arresting, quote, the worst of the worst illegal [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=47.76s)]
*  alien criminals there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=53.22s)]
*  In other words, far-left idiots are now taking to the streets, waving foreign flags, looting [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=54.9s)]
*  stores, burning cars in support of, let's see, murderers, rapists, gang members. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=60.76s)]
*  Remember, this is the party of Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=66.48s)]
*  So tonight, why don't we introduce you—this was on FoxNews.com—to some of the other [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=69.7s)]
*  criminal illegal aliens that the left is so desperate to keep in your country that Gavin [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=74.8s)]
*  is fighting for, Karen Bass is fighting for. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=80.12s)]
*  First up, Jose Ortiz from Ecuador, previously sentenced to 11 years in prison after getting [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=83.08s)]
*  caught with 11 kilos of cocaine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=90.08s)]
*  That's close to a half a million dollars' worth of cocaine. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=92.08s)]
*  Next up is Armando Ordaz, a suspected gang member from Mexico. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=95.62s)]
*  Now, Armando is a convicted sex offender and a thief. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=101.12s)]
*  Then, of course, is Victor Mendoza Aguilar from Mexico, who previously was deported in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  2017. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  This suspected gang member served time for drug charges and deadly assault with a deadly [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  weapon, among other crimes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=118.4s)]
*  And here is Delfino Aguilar Martinez from Mexico. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=120.34s)]
*  He was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon with great bodily injury. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  Next up is Ezwin Ariel Castro, who was also previously deported. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=129.76s)]
*  Castro has convictions for child molestation, has also been arrested for robbery, domestic [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=135.48s)]
*  violence. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=140.92s)]
*  And look at your screen. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=142.2s)]
*  This is Lionel Sanchez Laguna. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=144.06s)]
*  His crimes include battery to a spouse, cruelty to a child, shooting into a house, assault [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  with a firearm, oh, and a DUI on top of that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=153.0s)]
*  We could go on and on. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=156.2s)]
*  I have pages and pages and pages of people that they are arresting, including a convicted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=158.48s)]
*  murderer from Vietnam and the man, a guy from the Philippines convicted of an unspeakable [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=164.92s)]
*  sexual assault. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=170.02s)]
*  But just so we are clear, this is who the anti-ICE protesters are fighting for. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=171.4s)]
*  This is—these are the people that Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass are protecting. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=176.84s)]
*  These are the people that would still be on the streets of Los Angeles if their mayor, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=182.64s)]
*  if their governor had their way. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=187.24s)]
*  They were all protected, every one of them, under L.A. and California's insane sanctuary [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  city and state policies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=194.84s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom, who we expect will be speaking in this hour, he has been protecting [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=196.96s)]
*  these criminals for years, never once lifted a finger to protect the law-abiding citizens [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  in his state with sanctuary state laws that now some—Newsom now supports. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=212.96s)]
*  Police in California, they are not allowed to even ask criminals for their immigration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=213.96s)]
*  status. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=218.56s)]
*  State law enforcement officials are barred from working with ICE even to apprehend violent [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  convicted offenders. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=226.22s)]
*  They can't even hand them over to ICE. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=228.18s)]
*  My question for Governor Newsom—and I have a lot of them, and we'll put them up maybe [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=230.66s)]
*  in the course of the show tonight—was it worth it? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=234.88s)]
*  Are you proud of putting innocent Americans in danger by creating a sanctuary for criminal [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=238.24s)]
*  illegal aliens? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=243.96s)]
*  I'll put up—I'm going to scroll here the names of victims in California of violent [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=244.96s)]
*  crime. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  And while we get that up and running, think about this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=251.16s)]
*  We scrolled during the 2024 campaign all the names of people that were murdered and all [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  the people that were raped and all the people that were victims of violent crime because [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=260.6s)]
*  that they were lying about because they said the border is closed, the border is secure. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=265.64s)]
*  None of that was true. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=269.56s)]
*  We have the same thing out in the state of California. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=271.0s)]
*  And my question, we know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris never picked up a phone. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=273.56s)]
*  They never called the victims. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  They never called Laken Reilly's family, Rachel Moran's family, Jalsa Nungeri's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=278.88s)]
*  family. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Did Gavin Newsom ever call the victims' families in California? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  Now, probably won't answer that question, although we—you know, he did take a lot [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=289.08s)]
*  of time to respond and fight with me on X during the height of the riot. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=294.24s)]
*  And also Mark Wayne Mullen also took time to do multiple interviews on friendly, left-wing, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=298.48s)]
*  legacy media mob networks like MSDNC. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=304.0s)]
*  He even, in the middle of all this, had time to do podcasts just so he could trash Donald [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=307.68s)]
*  Trump while pretending to be a martyr, almost begging to be arrested. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=314.56s)]
*  It is, as usual, pathetic. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=319.56s)]
*  He's putting his own blind political ambition over the safety of law enforcement and the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=321.56s)]
*  safety of the law-abiding citizens of Los Angeles and in his own state. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  Instead of conducting himself like a leader when a state needed him the most, Gavin Newsom [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=331.84s)]
*  was trying to use the riots for political gain. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=336.2s)]
*  In fact, one California sheriff is telling Newsom, put the phone down, be quiet, because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  he, quote, is doing nothing but fueling this process. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  Remember, during the Pacific Palisades fires, he claimed no responsibility. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  Remember, they had fire hydrants. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=354.16s)]
*  They were empty. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=356.92s)]
*  They had reservoirs. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=357.92s)]
*  They were empty, too. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=358.92s)]
*  And then his answer was, well, it's not my fault. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  You need to ask the local elected officials. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=362.32s)]
*  I'm on the phone right now, ma'am, talking to Joe Biden. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=364.36s)]
*  He wasn't talking to Joe Biden. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=367.08s)]
*  Well, I'm going to talk to Joe Biden. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=368.08s)]
*  But it's not just Gavin Newsom. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=370.08s)]
*  The response of almost every top Democrat has been totally bizarre, completely dishonest. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=371.8s)]
*  I mean, you have Kamala Harris, you have Adam Schiff, you have Cory Booker. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=377.12s)]
*  You've got all the predictable actors. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=381.12s)]
*  Now, we can add Hillary Clinton to the list. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=384.0s)]
*  Maxine Waters claiming there's no violence, none at all, in Los Angeles. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=387.52s)]
*  Don't believe what your eyes are showing you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=396.52s)]
*  The protests, and even those who were out of step with what we are advocating, peaceful [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=397.64s)]
*  protests, did not create any violence. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  Nobody was shot. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  Nobody was killed. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  Get it in your head. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  Don't miss to point, you all. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Don't think that somehow, because they called out the National Guard, there was violence. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=413.08s)]
*  There was no violence. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=418.64s)]
*  I was on the street. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=421.4s)]
*  Oh, I went to a couple of streets, and I know. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=422.4s)]
*  Never mind what's on TV. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=426.76s)]
*  Never mind the videos. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=428.0s)]
*  Oh, let's see, we've got plenty of that we're going to be showing you throughout [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  the night. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=432.84s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=433.84s)]
*  Maxine? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=434.84s)]
*  No violence? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=435.84s)]
*  All of this peaceful? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=436.84s)]
*  No, we could show pictures. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=437.84s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  Cars on fire. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  That looks like violence taking place there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, another car on fire. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=444.0s)]
*  Looks like more violence taking place there. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=445.8s)]
*  Never mind the fact that law enforcement agents, they were being attacked, they were being [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  and mysterious liquids and baseball bats were placed, and the rioters just conveniently [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=452.4s)]
*  all had gas masks and frozen water bottles. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=458.28s)]
*  Anyway, and her colleague out there, Nancy Pelosi, said that lighting cars on fire, really [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=462.52s)]
*  not a big deal. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=467.56s)]
*  The rioters just got caught up in the exuberance of the moment. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=468.84s)]
*  Is this how you act when you're exuberant? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=473.28s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  When, and I say this as a former party chair. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  When there is a gathering, a large gathering of people, the anarchists see it as an opportunity [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=481.2s)]
*  and they move in. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  So always have to be careful whether you see a burned car or a broken window or whatever [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=490.12s)]
*  it is. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  It may be the exuberance of the moment, but it may be the anarchist setting in. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=501.0s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=502.76s)]
*  That horrible attack against her husband, and it was horrible. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=503.76s)]
*  Was that somebody being exuberant? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm feeling exuberant. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=508.56s)]
*  Let me attack somebody. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=509.88s)]
*  I'm feeling exuberant. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=510.88s)]
*  Let me attack cops. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=511.88s)]
*  I'm feeling exuberant. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=512.88s)]
*  Let me burn some cars. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=514.36s)]
*  What a genius. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=515.72s)]
*  And let's not forget about California's junior senator, the congenital liar, Adam Schiff. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=516.72s)]
*  Yesterday he filmed himself praising the peaceful nature of the riots. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=521.32s)]
*  Just pause for a second. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=526.12s)]
*  You know, in the summer of 2020, the media, Democrats, they're peaceful. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=527.52s)]
*  They're mostly peaceful. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=533.28s)]
*  Two dozen Americans died, thousands of cops injured, billions in property damage. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=534.28s)]
*  Anomalous said they won't stop, shouldn't stop, and she wouldn't stop supporting them. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  But they cared about only one riot, not the 574 riots. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, the border's closed. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=547.52s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=549.0799999999999s)]
*  Millions of people are walking across it, but it's closed. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden is cognitively as sharp as he's ever been. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=552.52s)]
*  It's hard to keep up with him. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=555.4799999999999s)]
*  These people lie all the time. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  They do all of this while blaming Trump for the riots, you know, not their own sanctuary [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=559.38s)]
*  city and state policies. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=564.16s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=565.64s)]
*  The streets are peaceful here in Los Angeles. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=567.28s)]
*  I hope and pray that they stay that way. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=569.04s)]
*  The folks who are being impacted by these immigration sweeps do not want violence done [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=572.6s)]
*  in their name. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  So outside people, agitators, whoever, just stay the hell out. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  And as for the president of the United States, commandeering the guard over the opposition [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  of the governor was a pointless and incendiary action. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=590.28s)]
*  It has made matters worse. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=595.32s)]
*  And now mobilization of the Marines, also just inflammatory and unnecessary. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  So do your job and stop making matters worse in Los Angeles. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=602.2s)]
*  This is why we call him the congenital liar. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  You have a party of liars and lunatics. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=609.44s)]
*  I can't emphasize that enough. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  These Democrats now speaking out in favor of violent riots taking place in Los Angeles [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=613.84s)]
*  in response to ICE apprehending the worst of the worst illegal immigrants convicted [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=619.32s)]
*  of murder and rape, child molestation in the face of anarchy and crime. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=625.88s)]
*  And it's no wonder Americans are overwhelmingly supporting Donald Trump's immigration policies. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=631.84s)]
*  Even fake news CNN pointed this out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=637.36s)]
*  It's especially true of illegal immigrants. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=641.7600000000001s)]
*  Immigrant voters, foreign-born voters have gone tremendously to the right on this issue [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=643.7600000000001s)]
*  in 2024 and 2025 versus where they were in 2020. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=648.48s)]
*  Closest to or trust more in immigration. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=651.68s)]
*  You go back to 2020. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=653.28s)]
*  Democrats get this, held a 32 point lead on this issue. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=654.4399999999999s)]
*  Immigrant voters were in the Democratic camp. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=658.36s)]
*  Jump forward to 2024, 2025. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=660.68s)]
*  Look at that shift, a 40 point shift to the right among immigrant voters. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=662.76s)]
*  Republicans now lead on this issue by eight points over Democrats. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=668.68s)]
*  Now look at that, a 40 point shift. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=674.64s)]
*  And by the way, mostly among immigrants, mostly among minorities. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=678.36s)]
*  They want safety and security in their own homes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=683.88s)]
*  They want the law to be followed. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=687.4s)]
*  They don't want anarchy. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=689.68s)]
*  And by the way, we'll get to this later with Matt Towery. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=691.48s)]
*  He has a poll out. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=694.24s)]
*  59 to 39 Americans support Donald Trump sending the guard to Los Angeles to help out with [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=695.68s)]
*  the mess there in that sanctuary city and state. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=701.92s)]
*  Democrats have lost the plot. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=705.4s)]
*  Senator Trump, the deportations, they're going to continue no matter what. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  And for the record, Matt Towery will join us and explain in detail why the American [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=710.7199999999999s)]
*  people approve of this and why there is a transformational political shift in the country [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=716.24s)]
*  as it relates to, oh, the Republican Party versus the Democratic Party. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=721.64s)]
*  Democratic Party, party of coastal, woke, elitist. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=725.7199999999999s)]
*  They don't want tax cuts, permanent tax cuts. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  They're against those. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=733.52s)]
*  They're going to vote against them. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=734.52s)]
*  Or tax, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=736.08s)]
*  They're the party that doesn't want energy production in this country and the wealth. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=739.48s)]
*  They don't want to control the border. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=743.16s)]
*  They want open borders. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=744.88s)]
*  Good luck with all these policies. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32524Y8nYg&t=746.16s)]
