# Leavitt demands answers from top Biden aides
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA)
*  Now, while the media mob tries to clean up its role in the Biden cover-up and the left [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=0.0s)]
*  tries to learn how to talk to menâ€”can you imagine? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=4.12s)]
*  $20 million to learn how to talk to men. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=7.12s)]
*  We do have some encouraging news to bring you tonight, because it's only been four [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=10.0s)]
*  months since President Trump took office. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=13.68s)]
*  And look at this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=16.5s)]
*  The economy is booming. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=17.5s)]
*  Consumer confidence just made its largest jump in four years amid a trade truce with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=18.5s)]
*  China. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=25.48s)]
*  The prices hit a four-year low last week ahead of the Memorial Day weekend, and it's time [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=26.48s)]
*  now for our Hannity Washington briefing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=31.64s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt is with us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=34.32s)]
*  Good news on the economy, and the markets do seem to respond whenever the president [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=37.42s)]
*  gets close to or starts talking about trade deals, like, for example, with China, like [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=42.96s)]
*  with Great Britain. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  Now, there's talk of a deal coming with the European Union. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  That's right, Sean. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=51.96s)]
*  There is good news today. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=55.38s)]
*  Consumer confidence hit a record high, and also the highly respected pollster Matt Rasmussen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=57.220000000000006s)]
*  showed that the majority of Americans view our country as heading on the right track [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  under President Trump. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=68.94s)]
*  This is a stark contrast to what that same polling showed under the previous disastrous [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=70.98s)]
*  administration led by Joe Biden. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=75.98s)]
*  As for the trade talks, since you mentioned them, I was just going back and forth with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=78.38s)]
*  trade representative Jameson Greer, who informed me that the Trump administration continues [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=83.1s)]
*  to be in intensive talks with India, and the president, of course, has applied very public [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=87.58s)]
*  pressure to the European Union so that they, too, can have a miraculous trade deal just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=93.16s)]
*  like we cut with Britain and our friends in the United Kingdom. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=98.84s)]
*  So we continue to move forward in cutting good deals that put the American people and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=103.1s)]
*  the American worker first. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, that Rasmussen poll you refer to, the percentage of Americans who say the country's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=111.02s)]
*  on the right track, is the highest number that they have surveyed in their 29-year polling [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=115.18s)]
*  history, which I found significant. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=122.86s)]
*  Let me ask you about the Trump FBI reopening investigations into the Supreme Court abortion [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  decision leak, the Biden White House cocaine scandal that lasted a whopping, what, 10 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=130.16s)]
*  days, and the January 6th pipe bomber mystery. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=135.5s)]
*  It seems like the administration is going back and getting to the bottom of some unfinished [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=140.02s)]
*  business. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=145.02s)]
*  Yes, all of those announcements coming from the FBI, Cash Patel, and of course our great [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=148.02s)]
*  Attorney General, Pam Bondi, who is committed to the truth, Sean, just like President Trump [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=152.38s)]
*  and his entire administration, and committed to an unprecedented level of access and transparency [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=157.3s)]
*  that is led by President Trump at the White House every day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=163.18s)]
*  He takes questions from the press. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=166.72s)]
*  He talks directly and honestly and candidly about the problems and the challenges he is [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=168.7s)]
*  solving, not just here at home, but also abroad. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=173.76s)]
*  And he's demanding answers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=176.56s)]
*  And one of the things he is going to continue to push for answers on is who the heck was [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=177.84s)]
*  running the country over the past four years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  And you just talked about it in your monologue, and I'm glad to hear it, because this is truly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=183.52s)]
*  the greatest political scandal our country has ever seen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=188.32s)]
*  We had unelected, radical left White House staffers who nobody knew their names running [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=191.96s)]
*  the most powerful country in the history of the world. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=198.84s)]
*  And the Democrat Party was in a complete alliance to cover it up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=201.9s)]
*  And the mainstream media was right along with them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=205.88s)]
*  They were asking Joe Biden what his favorite ice cream was, rather than asking him whether [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=207.84s)]
*  or not he was suited to run the country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=212.16s)]
*  And so we need answers on what took place over the past four years, because look at [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=215.12s)]
*  the consequences of having these unelected, radical left wing staffers in the West Wing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=218.72s)]
*  running the country. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=223.56s)]
*  We had a wide open border invasion that this administration is cleaning up every day despite [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=224.6s)]
*  challenges from the courts. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=229.32s)]
*  We had an economy that was left in the dust. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=230.88s)]
*  But again, thanks to President Trump's pro growth policies. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=233.68s)]
*  And now we have the one big, beautiful bill on its way to his desk. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=236.88s)]
*  It's in the Senate now being marked up and amended so it can go back to the House and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=239.84s)]
*  then to the president, ultimately for signature this summer. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=244.0s)]
*  So we have a lot of good news, thanks to President Trump and his policies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=247.1s)]
*  But we need answers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=250.82s)]
*  And the American people demanded them with the overwhelming victory that they gave to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=251.82s)]
*  President Trump on November 5th in the total and complete rejection of the Democrat Party [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=255.98s)]
*  and Joe Biden. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  So Harvard, for example, has a $53 billion endowment. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=263.06s)]
*  We'll go through some of the finances later in the show tonight. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=265.98s)]
*  $53 billion is a lot of money. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=268.86s)]
*  And they also have institutionalized discrimination and anti-Semitism. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=271.9s)]
*  And they've not taken a stand against it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=276.02s)]
*  Yet they take a stand against everything else and embrace DEI. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=278.06s)]
*  My question is, why would they get one American taxpayer dollar knowing that this is the case [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=282.02s)]
*  and also the case at a lot of other Ivy League institutions? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=287.62s)]
*  Well, that's a very good question, Sean, rooted in common sense. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=292.38s)]
*  And I watched the left-wing cable media, CNN, on my television in the White House all day [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=298.06s)]
*  today, and they were up in arms over the president's common sense policy when it comes to federal [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  funding for Harvard. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=309.54s)]
*  And not a single one of those left-wing reporters can answer the question of why an institution [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=311.26s)]
*  that is pushing anti-American values with a $53 billion endowment should receive a single [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=316.66s)]
*  penny of taxpayer funds. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  And the president is more interested in giving that taxpayer money to trade schools and programs [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=325.18s)]
*  in state schools where they are promoting American values, but most importantly, educating [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=331.42s)]
*  the next generation based on skills that we need in our economy and our society, apprenticeships, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=337.02s)]
*  electricians, plumbers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=343.82s)]
*  We need more of those in our country and less LGBTQ graduate majors from Harvard University. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's what this administration's position is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=352.5s)]
*  And we also are not going to tolerate the illegal criminal anti-Semitic behavior that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=354.58s)]
*  we saw take place at Harvard and many other college campuses across the country. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=359.34s)]
*  In light of the new information that has become available through this book that has come [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=364.5s)]
*  out about Joe Biden's cognitive decline and the reason that certain people around Biden [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=368.94s)]
*  covered it up and the media covered it up, will there be, should there be an investigation [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=376.18s)]
*  into who knew what and when and who was really in control? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=382.34s)]
*  I believe the president certainly thinks there should be. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=389.06s)]
*  And I know James Comer, our friend on Capitol Hill, is interested in bringing some people [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=391.82s)]
*  to the Hill to testify about what they knew and when. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=396.34s)]
*  Because again, this is not just noise. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  This isn't just about a book. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=401.82s)]
*  This isn't about just who knew what and when. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=403.46s)]
*  This is about who knew about the policies that were being implemented that had grave [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=405.88s)]
*  consequences and a grave impact on our nation's national security and our homeland security, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=411.06s)]
*  policies that took the lives of innocent Americans across the country, like the open border policies [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=417.82000000000005s)]
*  that led to an illegal immigrant invasion. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=422.38000000000005s)]
*  People need to be held accountable. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=425.22s)]
*  And who knew what and when are certainly questions that need to be answered. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=427.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=431.78000000000003s)]
*  There is the Sean Hannity show. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=433.04s)]
*  White House briefing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k-XVc6fXvA&t=436.3s)]
