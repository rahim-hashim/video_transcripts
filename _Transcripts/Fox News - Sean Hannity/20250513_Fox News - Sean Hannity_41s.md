*  Everybody from Saudi Arabia on that dais all said to me, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=0.0s)]
*  oh, we know Mr. Hannity. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=4.64s)]
*  We watch your show all the time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I look a lot better with makeup, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=7.68s)]
*  don't you think? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=9.92s)]
*  Their overwhelming desire is for peace in the region. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=11.18s)]
*  And their overwhelming belief is that the person that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=15.88s)]
*  is best able to bring that together [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=19.88s)]
*  is going to be President Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  And there's a reason why that the Saudis have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  have committed over a trillion dollars in investment [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=28.26s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  The Iranians have a choice. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=33.0s)]
*  The president said, I'd rather they choose the peaceful route. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  I believe that he means that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=37.7s)]
*  I believe he's sincere about that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRybJvBejNs&t=39.400000000000006s)]
