# Trump admin pushes to ban China from buying US farmland: ‘Farm security is national security’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk)
*  Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=0.0s)]
*  While Democrats continue their performative politics, Republicans are getting important [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=4.84s)]
*  work done. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=9.28s)]
*  This morning, Senator Josh Hawley introduced legislation aimed at ending at blocking Chinese [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=10.52s)]
*  corporations and CCP-linked individuals from buying farmland in the U.S. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  This comes just two days after Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins unveiled the National [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=21.12s)]
*  Farm Security Action Plan, meant to address threats from foreign governments like China. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=25.82s)]
*  Secretary Rollins is here now with the latest. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=32.54s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Madam Secretary. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=34.46s)]
*  So first of all, tell us about what this plan involves. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=37.34s)]
*  Well thanks for having me on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  It's a beautiful night here at the White House, so really, really an honor to be on [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=44.54s)]
*  with you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  Listen, two days ago we took unprecedented action, unlike anything in American history. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  We had four cabinet secretaries, Defense Secretary Hegseth, Homeland Security Secretary Noem, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=55.26s)]
*  Attorney General Bondi, White House Counselor Peter Navarro, three of our best governors, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=62.1s)]
*  multiple leaders from the Hill. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  And together we said that farm security is national security. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=68.3s)]
*  We cannot be the world's superpower if in fact our foreign adversaries are buying up [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=73.26s)]
*  all of our farmland, especially in strategic places around a lot of our military bases. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  So we moved out a plan to start getting ahead of that right away. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=84.14s)]
*  As you have mentioned, Senator Hawley was earlier on your show talking about what he's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=87.86s)]
*  hoping to accomplish in Congress. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=91.78s)]
*  We are working alongside all of our partners at the national, state, and local level to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=93.86s)]
*  get our arms around this, to stop it from happening in the future, and to look at clawing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=99.06s)]
*  it back as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think China is trying to buy up all this land? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, China plays a long game. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=108.66s)]
*  They are extremely smart about the way they approach this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=112.9s)]
*  They're looking to be the world's superpower. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=116.14s)]
*  And here's what I do know. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=118.42s)]
*  Guess how much land America owns in China? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=120.18s)]
*  Zero. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=123.42s)]
*  Guess how much land America has around Chinese military bases? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  Zero. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=128.18s)]
*  So this president, President Trump, has been so resolute and so visionary in putting America [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=129.18s)]
*  first. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=135.46s)]
*  But to do that, it isn't just a strong defense. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=136.46s)]
*  It isn't just a strong economy. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=138.72s)]
*  It isn't just a strong border. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=140.1s)]
*  We have to protect our farms and our agriculture. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=141.78s)]
*  If we can't feed ourselves, we are no longer the world's superpower. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=144.78s)]
*  And that is what he's working to do. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=148.46s)]
*  And he's got the right team on the field to do it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=150.22s)]
*  And we're making big progress. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=152.02s)]
*  That is certainly true. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=153.9s)]
*  Can you explain to us in very simple terms what exactly the plan that you're proffering [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=155.06s)]
*  now would actually do to prevent it? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=160.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=162.82s)]
*  It's a seven-point plan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=163.82s)]
*  The first is what we talked about. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=165.06s)]
*  The first of the seven is the farmland specifically, working with Congress to move legislation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  through. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  We've got an executive order coming out soon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  Working with the governors, 20 states have already passed legislation to ban the sale [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=174.14000000000001s)]
*  of China farmland. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=178.9s)]
*  Often, I say this a lot, the 10th Amendment and the Constitution, the states are the guardians [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=179.9s)]
*  at the gate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=184.22s)]
*  They're already moving forward and we're working alongside them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  But it also includes, for example, today we fired at USDA 70 contractors that USDA, the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=188.18s)]
*  American government, funds in these foreign adversarial countries who are doing research. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=194.58s)]
*  Now, nothing nefarious to report, but why are we using American taxpayer dollars to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  do that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=205.02s)]
*  Locking down our animal and plant disease, the agro-terrorism piece. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=206.02s)]
*  Our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, just two weeks ago went after a couple of Chinese [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=210.3s)]
*  researchers who were sneaking in seeds that would have really compromised our food supply [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  system, ensuring that animal disease isn't coming across the border. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  So it is an all-encompassing plan at USDA.gov. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=224.58s)]
*  We've released a lot of information on it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=228.58s)]
*  We're really excited about deploying immediately. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=231.18s)]
*  Real quickly, because we don't have a whole lot of time left yet, can you tell us who [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=234.18s)]
*  is it that you are running up against inside the government that is opposed to your efforts [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=238.94s)]
*  to kick China out of the United States? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=246.42s)]
*  Well, listen, all the Republicans are 100% aligned. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=250.38s)]
*  And the people of America are as well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=255.82s)]
*  It's interesting, the blue states have not been leading on this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=258.53999999999996s)]
*  I am still trying to figure out why. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=261.41999999999996s)]
*  The 20 states that have passed laws, Governor Sanders, Governor Lee, I mean, all of our [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=263.7s)]
*  great red states are all the ones who've been leading. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=268.18s)]
*  Kristi Noem is governor of South Dakota, was one of the real pioneers on this effort over [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=270.82s)]
*  the last few years. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  But my hope and vision and working alongside our president in this White House, this is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=276.74s)]
*  not a red or blue issue. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=281.14s)]
*  This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=282.7s)]
*  This is national security. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=285.02s)]
*  So I look forward to finding those additional allies out there and getting this done. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, it certainly shouldn't be. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=291.14s)]
*  If you ever do run up against anybody who is lobbying on behalf of China in our government, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=293.26s)]
*  I hope you'll be, we'll be the first people you come to to tell about it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=298.14s)]
*  You will. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=302.62s)]
*  You have my commitment, Charlie. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=303.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=304.62s)]
*  Thank you, Secretary Rollins. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=305.62s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-20oBHWoVk&t=316.86s)]
