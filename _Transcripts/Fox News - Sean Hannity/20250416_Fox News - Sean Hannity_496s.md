# Rachel Morin's mother reveals Biden administration's silence after daughter's murder
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg)
*  And tonight, justice for Rachel Moran, the illegal immigrant who raped and murdered the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=0.0s)]
*  Maryland mother of five in 2023, was found guilty on all counts. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=5.96s)]
*  The jury, they deliberated for less than an hour before deciding to convict. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Now, that's how clear cut this case was. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=14.92s)]
*  So, while justice did prevail in this case, Rachel should be alive today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=17.56s)]
*  Her killer should never have been allowed into our country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=22.04s)]
*  There's blood on the hands of every single person that allowed this to happen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=26.68s)]
*  Democrats have allowed over 12 million-plus illegals, gotaways, including known terrorists, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=31.8s)]
*  murderers, rapists, other violent criminals, drug dealers, cartel members, into our country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=38.44s)]
*  And even today, they are championing their so-called rights over your safety. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=44.92s)]
*  How many more Americans will be victims to these violent criminals committed by these [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=50.58s)]
*  Biden-Harris illegals? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=57.46s)]
*  Anyway, tonight, our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Rachel's family, her [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=59.06s)]
*  five children, and her mother, Patty Moran, who joins us now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=64.02s)]
*  Patty, thank you for being with us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=68.5s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=70.38s)]
*  I've had the opportunity to talk to you before. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=71.38s)]
*  And I want to get your reaction to the verdict. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  And it will never bring back your daughter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=78.22s)]
*  It will never bring back the mother of your five grandchildren. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=80.22s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=87.5s)]
*  Maybe you have some vindication, but I'm sure it's in a lot of ways hollow, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=90.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=96.5s)]
*  First, you have to understandâ€”and I think the American people don't understand the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=97.94s)]
*  gruesome brutality of the crime. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  And a lot of the details were left out when they gave us kind of like the outline of what [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  they were going to present to the prosecutors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=116.38s)]
*  But when you were actually sitting in the courtroom, when we were there for the whole [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=119.1s)]
*  trial, and they showed over 500 pieces of evidence and very, very graphic crime scene [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=122.3s)]
*  photos and autopsy photos. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=131.06s)]
*  And when you saw that three-fourths of her brain was hemorrhaged, that three-fourths [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=137.54s)]
*  of her skull was bashed in, she had a six-inch square in the back of her head where the skull [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=144.42s)]
*  was shattered the way that you would crush an eggshell. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  She had her face was bashed in. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=156.42s)]
*  She had literally bruises, contusions, scrapes all over her body. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=159.46s)]
*  The murderer dragged her 150 yards as blood gushed out of her head into the tunnel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=170.62s)]
*  And then he put her up against the tunnel wall and raped her. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=179.62s)]
*  And you could see her body and you see the outline of blood from her head running down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  So you see the outline of her body and blood on the tunnel wall. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=189.46s)]
*  These are the kind of people that the Biden-Harris administration has allowed into our country. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=194.18s)]
*  And they think that it's okay to defend them instead of defending my daughter and protecting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=201.10000000000002s)]
*  us. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=208.22000000000003s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=209.22000000000003s)]
*  So I am having seen the evidence and seeing the gruesome brutality that my daughter had [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=211.82s)]
*  to endure. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  I am very grateful to all the law enforcement and all the investigation and all the different [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  law enforcement agencies that work to find the suspect and to bring him to justice. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=229.38s)]
*  So when we heard the verdict, it was very sad because we had to relive and see everything [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=238.14s)]
*  that my daughter suffered. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=245.66s)]
*  But then at the same time, we were convinced that this was the murderer and that justice [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  was served. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=255.06s)]
*  No mother should have to live through what you've lived through and had to sit through [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=259.1s)]
*  a trial like this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=263.54s)]
*  It was the most preventable national security crisis that was created. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=264.70000000000005s)]
*  Did you ever get a call from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Alejandro Mayorkas or your [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=269.94s)]
*  Senator Von Hollen, who made a big deal about he's going to go to El Salvador and bring [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=278.14000000000004s)]
*  home this one illegal from El Salvador, who Democrats are saying had no business being [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=285.86s)]
*  sent back to his home country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=293.38s)]
*  He was in this country illegally. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=294.73999999999995s)]
*  And I will point out that it was determined by a judge that the respondent is a gang member [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=296.94s)]
*  in this case. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=305.52s)]
*  And did they ever call you? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  And what are your thoughts on your Senator going to bat for this illegal? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=309.5s)]
*  But did he ever say anything to you and your family about your loss to ever call you, ever [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=316.82s)]
*  take the time to be with you? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=321.22s)]
*  No, actually, I'm very angry. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=323.22s)]
*  I'm actually outraged, but I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=327.54s)]
*  He did not call our family. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  He did not give condolences. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=336.94000000000005s)]
*  There was no action on the Democratic Party in any way, from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  Mike Orkas, anyone here in Maryland, none of the senators, did anything to help search [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=347.54s)]
*  for the murderer of my daughter. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=355.86s)]
*  And nobody called you? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  My daughter, she's, nope. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=359.70000000000005s)]
*  I didn't receive a call from anybody. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=362.66s)]
*  I did receive, after Trump, President Trump called, I did receive a call from Governor [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=364.26s)]
*  And, you know, he just repeated himself a couple of times, just saying that he gives [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=372.38s)]
*  his condolences and if there's anything that they can do. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=379.1s)]
*  But they just seemed like hollow words to me that they wanted to make sure because President [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=383.06s)]
*  Trump wasn't president yet. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=389.7s)]
*  And he called me that he should do something being the governor. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=391.78s)]
*  But it was like an afterthought, not that he genuinely cared. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=396.86s)]
*  Are the kids okay? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=401.06s)]
*  How are the kids doing, Patty? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=402.26000000000005s)]
*  They're having a hard time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=406.06s)]
*  Two of her daughters testified at the trial. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=408.5s)]
*  And it was so heartbreaking because one of the things that we were asked as a family [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=411.98s)]
*  was not to have any outbursts, you know, of emotions so that we didn't sway the jury [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=416.94000000000005s)]
*  one way or the other. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=423.14000000000004s)]
*  My granddaughter was on the stand and she couldn't contain herself. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=425.58s)]
*  She was crying when she was remembering the last time she spoke with her mom and the last [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=430.38s)]
*  text messages. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=436.38s)]
*  And you heard her when she walked out of the courtroom after her testimony and she just [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  couldn't contain it anymore. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=442.9s)]
*  She was just sobbing so hard. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=444.62s)]
*  It was just, it was so heart-wrenching. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=448.46s)]
*  Our prayers are with you, Patty. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=452.82s)]
*  How much pain this has cost. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=453.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=456.22s)]
*  Our prayers are with you and those kids and may God grant you all the peace that you all [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=457.22s)]
*  deserve. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=462.74s)]
*  I'm so sorry that you went through that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=463.74s)]
*  And what's so sad is it's so preventable. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=465.74s)]
*  I'm glad at least justice was served in this case, but it will never bring back your mother. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=468.86s)]
*  It will never bring back your, it will never bring back your daughter or the mother of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=473.38s)]
*  your grandchildren. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=478.58000000000004s)]
*  And we appreciate you joining us tonight. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8LIb9JNeg&t=483.02s)]
