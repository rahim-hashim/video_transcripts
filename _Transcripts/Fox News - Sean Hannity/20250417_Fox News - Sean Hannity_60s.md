# Most Americans are concerned about ‘real things,' says comedian Tim Dillon #foxnews #shorts #news
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk)
*  Yeah, you know, listen, I think it's a luxury to be offended by something. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think, for a couple of years, we were really into words, and people were offended [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=5.72s)]
*  by things, and, like, the Democratic Party made the last week of the election about a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=10.4s)]
*  joke they didn't like at a rally that a comedian made. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=14.44s)]
*  And most people are concerned with real things, like their safety, the amount of money they [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=17.92s)]
*  have, you know, their families. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  And I think people now are relaxing, and they just want to hear things that are, you know, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=26.16s)]
*  that are amusing and challenging, and they want to—they don't want to run away from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=30.8s)]
*  these debates. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=35.56s)]
*  I think they're important to have. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=36.56s)]
*  And I think the Democratic Party got away from being the working-class party, and now [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=37.56s)]
*  they seem to be like the party of very coddled college kids and very wealthy people who have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=44.24s)]
*  the luxury of getting offended at, like, a joke or something like that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSr1C05hkRk&t=53.2s)]
