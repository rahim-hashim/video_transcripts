# Sean Hannity: The days of ripping off Americans are over
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA)
*  I'm welcome to Hannity and tonight the momentum at the White House is palpable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=0.0s)]
*  We are now in the midst of a great American reset and President Trump is racking up one [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  win after another, whether the mainstream media and Democrats like it or not. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=16.34s)]
*  Now even Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has stepped onto the Trump train [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=20.84s)]
*  infuriating her radical colleagues. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=26.82s)]
*  We're going to explain that tonight straight ahead. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Also, Tom Homan will be here with more on his very important work deporting criminal [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities and a battle in New Jersey. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=35.96s)]
*  Alina Haber will respond to the New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy, who just ordered local [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  police to stop working with immigration officials. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Hmm, I wonder, I'll ask Alina whether maybe he is aiding and abetting law breaking. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=50.28s)]
*  And in our other news of the day segment, President Trump is making America's water [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=57.64s)]
*  pressure great again. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Yes, normal showers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=63.32s)]
*  We'll check in with Clay Travis. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=65.36s)]
*  Plus, we'll show you what happened when Anderson Cooper misgendered someone on fake news CNN. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=66.36s)]
*  Then he got beat up by Bernie Sanders all in one night. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=72.04s)]
*  Not a good night for him. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=75.56s)]
*  But we begin with some incredible new numbers. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=77.0s)]
*  This month, consumer prices, they actually dropped. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  This never once happened under Joe Biden. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=83.12s)]
*  Also down to a six month low. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=86.0s)]
*  Oh, we'll call that the Trump effect at just 2.4%, which is way better than expected. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=88.72s)]
*  Core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy, is now below 3% for the first time [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=94.56s)]
*  since March of 2021. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  When did Joe become president? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's right, in January of 21. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  Now, energy prices are down, gas prices are down, interest rates are coming down, grocery [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  prices. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=114.56s)]
*  Thankfully, they've stabilized with many products seeing price reductions, including peanut [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=115.56s)]
*  butter and eggs. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=119.4s)]
*  And the president's trade negotiations are paying off big time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=121.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  We're working with a lot of different countries and it's all going to work out very well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  I think it's going to work out really very well. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=130.0s)]
*  But we're in good shape. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=132.04s)]
*  There's no inflation, there's very little inflation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=134.28s)]
*  We think we're in very good shape. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=136.84s)]
*  We think we're doing very well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=138.36s)]
*  Again, there'll be a transition cost and transition problems. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=140.28s)]
*  But in the end, it's going to be a beautiful thing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=145.88s)]
*  We're doing again what we should have done many years ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=149.44s)]
*  We're letting it get out of control. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  And we'll have some countries to get very big and very rich at our expense. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=157.48s)]
*  And not going to, can't let that happen. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=163.32s)]
*  It's not a sustainable formula. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=166.28s)]
*  Now, President Trump promised to bring down your prices, empower American businesses and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=169.88s)]
*  spare what he calls a new golden age of American prosperity. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  And despite the doubters, the haters, the weak need, Washington establishment, institutionalists, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=178.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is fulfilling his promise in spite of all of them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=183.92s)]
*  And this time, he has a lot of help from his own cabinet. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=187.78s)]
*  They're working together around the clock to fulfill President Trump's very ambitious [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=190.68s)]
*  agenda, restore sanity to our federal government. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=195.72s)]
*  And today's cabinet meeting was beyond impressive. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=199.68s)]
*  It is truly incredible to see so many important things getting done all at once. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=202.44s)]
*  This is what I call transformational and consequential change that our country is desperately needed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=207.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Multiple administrations have allowed the Chinese to de-industrialize this country, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  to take away jobs and factories and pillars of our national strength. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  And what you're doing now, I think, is a great service to our country, but ultimately to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=223.82s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  We've launched Operation Stork Speed to get the bad chemicals out of baby formula. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=227.64s)]
*  We're working with governors across the country to get good food into the school lunch programs [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=235.44s)]
*  and to get rid of chemical dyes and other bad chemicals in our food. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=241.6s)]
*  The Biden EPA was strangulating the economy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=247.0s)]
*  The Trump EPA understands it's not a binary choice. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  We can protect the environment and grow the economy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  We are going to revitalize and make shipbuilding and maritime great again. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=256.48s)]
*  These blue collar jobs, these are the cranes, the ports, opportunity zones, and drive that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=261.44s)]
*  investment back in. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=267.32s)]
*  Food security is national security. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=269.04s)]
*  We have to be able to feed ourselves. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=272.0s)]
*  And your idea of using tariffs along with deregulation and tax cuts, but your idea of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  using tariffs to ensure that we are putting forward and putting America first, no one [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  understands that better than our farmers and our ranchers. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  Wall Street's done great for the past four years, 10 years, 20 years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=287.8s)]
*  It can continue doing great, but it's Main Street's turn now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=292.24s)]
*  Your directive to me was to keep America safe. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's what we're doing, whether it's the alien enemies, all of these gangs, and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=299.24s)]
*  they are enemies of our country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  They are terrorists. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=305.32000000000005s)]
*  They are organized crime. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=306.32000000000005s)]
*  They have come here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=307.32000000000005s)]
*  They are extremely organized. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=308.44s)]
*  They are spread throughout our country and they are creating terror. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  And no more under your directive. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=313.32s)]
*  And what a difference a couple of months makes. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  And now we are in very good hands. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  And by the way, Elon Musk was also in the room while some of the publicity surrounding [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=321.08s)]
*  Doge has died down. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=326.44s)]
*  Their important work is continuing day in, day out. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  They are rooting out waste, fraud, abuse and corruption. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=330.55999999999995s)]
*  They are saving you, the American taxpayer, hundreds of billions of dollars in the process. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=333.88s)]
*  We are now up to a whopping $150 billion in estimated savings for fiscal year 2026. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=338.92s)]
*  This is good news for most Americans, but of course, there's no pleasing the radical [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=346.76s)]
*  left. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  They're going to hate Trump and everything he does, no matter what. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  Coincidentally, China, also very unhappy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  Instead of working with America, like almost every other country in the world, is now begging [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=358.76s)]
*  to do and hammer out a free and fair trade agreement with CCP, they're lashing out. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=363.36s)]
*  First, they started a trade war that they cannot win. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=368.8s)]
*  Next, China started adding American companies to a trading blacklist while desperately searching [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=372.2s)]
*  for new buyers in other markets. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=378.12s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=380.02s)]
*  And now even some CCP linked individuals are threatening to increase fentanyl smuggling [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=381.12s)]
*  into our country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=387.34s)]
*  Now just so we're clear, the country that steals our technology and intellectual property [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=388.92s)]
*  theft, that spies on our citizens, never once apologized or took a shred of responsibility [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=394.26s)]
*  for what they did with COVID and the country that tariffs us to death, they now threaten [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=400.38s)]
*  to kill more Americans with a trading partner like that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=405.62s)]
*  Who needs enemies? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=409.82s)]
*  But tonight, there is one measure that China is taking against the U.S. and it's causing [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=410.82s)]
*  quite a chuckle at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=415.74s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=418.46s)]
*  President, China retaliated today by reducing the number of American films that can be shown [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=420.02s)]
*  there. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=425.09999999999997s)]
*  What's your reaction to them now targeting cultural exports from the United States? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=426.09999999999997s)]
*  I think I've heard of worse things than that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=430.41999999999996s)]
*  Make no mistake, China's long overdue for some accountability. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=433.29999999999995s)]
*  And tonight, I'll say this again. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, President Xi, you are playing chicken with the wrong guy. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=443.02s)]
*  President Trump's not backing down from a fight. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=447.34s)]
*  And at some point, China and President Xi, they will be forced to beg for access to our [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=450.14s)]
*  markets they needed desperately for their tumbling economy, or they're going to watch [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  their economies in China implode. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=460.62s)]
*  The days of ripping off America and Americans are officially over. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=464.2s)]
*  Here with reaction, Fox Business Anchor and, of course, the host of Sunday Futures, Maria [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=469.78s)]
*  Bartiromo is with us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  Maria, let's get your take on this, because we have been ripped off for years. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=476.3s)]
*  I don't like being ripped off. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=481.5s)]
*  I don't like bad deals. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=482.78s)]
*  I don't like that the very countries, in many cases, that we provide national defense for [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=483.98s)]
*  or that would rely on us for national defense, the other country's doing it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  And they know they're doing it, which is why I think they're lining up to get a trade deal. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=493.98s)]
*  That's right, Sean. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=498.42s)]
*  Good evening to you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=499.42s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=500.42s)]
*  Look, China has been exhibiting bad behavior for a long time, and it has been undermining [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=501.42s)]
*  the United States at every turn. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  President Trump is not going to back down on this, because at this point, we all know [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=508.94s)]
*  who the adversary slash enemy is. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=512.66s)]
*  And you're right, the U.S. consumer is paramount here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=516.22s)]
*  China needs to sell all of those products that they're producing for the world to the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  very powerful U.S. consumer. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=525.02s)]
*  So if China wants to keep doubling down, it is not going to be good for the Chinese economy. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=527.14s)]
*  The economy there right now is a lot weaker than people know, and this huge tariff on [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=531.84s)]
*  its products is not going to be good. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=537.02s)]
*  There are other levers to pull in the United States as well, and I don't think China wants [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=539.38s)]
*  the United States going down that road anytime soon either. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=543.74s)]
*  Remember, there are so many Chinese companies that trade on our exchanges, some of which, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=547.3s)]
*  are on entity and blacklists here in the U.S. as well. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=553.76s)]
*  So we have ordinary investors and big institutions buying those stocks because they trade freely [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=558.28s)]
*  on our exchanges, even though these companies do not even follow the same accounting, the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=564.6s)]
*  standard accounting rules that every other publicly traded company follow. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=568.84s)]
*  But if the Treasury secretary decided to yank those companies off of those exchanges on [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=572.32s)]
*  a directive from President Trump, then our investors would no longer be funding the expansion [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=578.16s)]
*  of our number one enemy because that is what's happening with these stocks traded on the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=584.4399999999999s)]
*  exchanges. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=588.52s)]
*  But, you know, today we had a huge sell-off for a lot of reasons. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=589.52s)]
*  It was this idea that this soft war with China was worsening. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  The dollar was down, rates were up, the stock market was down. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=596.36s)]
*  And don't forget, we're sitting on the doorstep of first quarter earnings, Sean. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=599.6s)]
*  Tomorrow morning, you're going to get earnings from JPMorgan, BlackRock, a whole host of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=603.28s)]
*  other major financials. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=607.8s)]
*  And Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, will once again have the microphone. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=609.68s)]
*  And he is going to talk about his quarter and what is ahead. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=614.12s)]
*  What you won't get, I think, in a number of companies reporting earnings in the coming [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=617.52s)]
*  weeks, is you won't get solid guidance because they don't have the clarity that they need [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=621.72s)]
*  to give us, you know, the guidance of here's what 2025 looks like, here's what the next [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=626.08s)]
*  couple of quarters look like. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=629.56s)]
*  And that was also part of the sell-off today. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=631.06s)]
*  Your interview, by the way, was pretty critical with Jamie Dimon at the right time. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=633.72s)]
*  And some people believe maybe it had an impact on the 90-day pause. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=637.8s)]
*  So I don't like when people get confused. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=642.44s)]
*  So the issue is countries will have the choice of free and fair trade if they want it or [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=645.2s)]
*  if they decide they want to put tariffs on American products, then there will be reciprocal [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=650.48s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=655.04s)]
*  But there are other economic issues and that we do have to contend with. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=656.04s)]
*  One would be currency manipulation. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=662.04s)]
*  Another would be, say, trade deficits. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=664.88s)]
*  I'm not that worried about trade deficits, especially with Europe, because I think once [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  the president gets up and running his energy dominance plan, I think Europe is almost going [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  to have to buy our energy because otherwise they're going to rely on Putin. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=678.36s)]
*  And right now I don't think they're too fond of Putin. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=682.68s)]
*  Yeah, you're spot on, Sean, because these are the deals that President Trump is working [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=685.24s)]
*  on right now. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=690.02s)]
*  He's trying to get deals done with regard to U.S. energy. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=691.02s)]
*  He wants to be able to, number one, tap into the energy capacity in America when he says [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=694.5s)]
*  drill, baby, drill, but as a second component of that, to sell our energy across the world. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=699.54s)]
*  He'd like to do a deal with Europe with regard to that, South Korea. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=705.5s)]
*  We're probably going to hear a deal with Japan. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=709.5s)]
*  So in the coming couple of weeks now, now he's put the 90-day pause in place. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=712.06s)]
*  July is the new date that we're—early July, the new date that we're focused on, July [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=717.38s)]
*  9th, I think it is, is the 90 days. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=722.58s)]
*  And within this timeframe, going into that date, we're going to hear deals with Japan, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=724.9s)]
*  South Korea, India as well, and he's going to try to be selling our energy to many of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=729.42s)]
*  those nations. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=735.9s)]
*  I'm sure that that's one of the components. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=736.9s)]
*  He's looking at non-tariff situations, and it is manipulating the currency. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=738.5s)]
*  And it is some of this behavior that Communist China has been doing. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=743.46s)]
*  Let's not forget, it's not just manipulating the currency. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=746.7s)]
*  It's the fentanyl, it's the COVID and the COVID cover-up. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=750.1s)]
*  It's buying land near our military installations, you know, intellectual property theft for [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=753.5s)]
*  decades and decades. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=759.02s)]
*  President Trump understands China, and he knows his customer and what they've been [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=760.5400000000001s)]
*  doing all of these decades. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=765.0s)]
*  He's not going to back down. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=766.5400000000001s)]
*  The Chinese economy needs the U.S. consumer. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=767.82s)]
*  So it's not a good idea for the CCP to get tough now with China, with the United States, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=770.42s)]
*  as it started the presidential term of Donald Trump 2.0 already on its back heels. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=777.5799999999999s)]
*  Because remember, when Joe Biden came in, they stopped finishing their promise of the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=783.74s)]
*  first trade deal that President Trump put in in his first term with China. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=788.42s)]
*  So they were already on their back heels, needing to come forward and do something for [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=792.02s)]
*  the United States. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=796.42s)]
*  All right, Maria, we appreciate you staying up late. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=798.42s)]
*  We know you got up very early. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=801.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=802.02s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AncZuHlx3JA&t=803.02s)]
