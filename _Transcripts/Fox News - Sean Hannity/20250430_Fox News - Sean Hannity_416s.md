# Trump annihilates ABC anchor: ‘BEATDOWN OF ALL BEATDOWNS’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs)
*  But first, we begin with that Cabinet meeting in the West Wing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=0.0s)]
*  Look, unlike the last administration, Trump officials, they actually meet and report back [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=3.72s)]
*  to you, the American people, all of you, with transparency that is unprecedented. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=8.88s)]
*  What a change a couple of months can make. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=14.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=16.32s)]
*  I view this 100 days as setting the table for peace deals, trade deals, tax deals, so [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=17.32s)]
*  the next 100 days will be harvesting. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=23.28s)]
*  You've created negotiating leverage and leadership. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=26.12s)]
*  They're going to yield remarkable results. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=28.64s)]
*  Energy costs have plummeted. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=31.6s)]
*  Mortgage rates are down. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=33.44s)]
*  Food costs are moving lower. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=34.68s)]
*  And American families are finding their financial footing again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=36.4s)]
*  We've been working very closely with your great attorney general's team at the DEA to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=40.4s)]
*  get these known cartels into our systems to be able to stop them at the border and turning [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=47.96s)]
*  over names to the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to be able to find those who are [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=52.92s)]
*  already here in our country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=58.32s)]
*  Over the past 100 days, we are already making America healthy again. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=59.92s)]
*  We announced last week the ban on the nine petroleum-based synthetic dyes, food dyes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=64.24s)]
*  Within two years, within two months, we're going to ban the worst two of them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  This president inherited 30 years of foreign policy that was built around what was good [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=77.32s)]
*  for the world. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=81.08s)]
*  In essence, the decisions we made as a government in trade and foreign policy was basically, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=82.08s)]
*  is it good for the world? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=86.92s)]
*  Is it good for the global community? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=87.92s)]
*  And under President Trump, we're making a foreign policy now that's, was it good for America? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=88.92s)]
*  Is it good for you? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=94.92s)]
*  Trump 101, transparency, accountability, nonstop action, multiple fronts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=96.92s)]
*  As always, the state-run legacy media mob, they will lie, they will mislead, they will [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=101.92s)]
*  create false narratives. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=105.84s)]
*  But frankly, it no longer matters. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=107.6s)]
*  Very few people are watching and listening to them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Trump, his White House officials, they speak directly to you every single day, all day. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=113.12s)]
*  And in the process, the president continues to stomp on the credibility of America's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=118.12s)]
*  self-proclaimed, quote, journalists. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=123.12s)]
*  Take a look at last night's explosive interview on ABC. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=125.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=128.24s)]
*  They're giving you the big break of a lifetime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=129.24s)]
*  You know, you're doing the interview. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=131.24s)]
*  I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's OK. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=132.56s)]
*  But I picked you, Terry, but you're not being very nice. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=135.56s)]
*  You think Vladimir Putin wants peace? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=139.12s)]
*  I think he does, yes. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=141.92s)]
*  I think he does. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=143.32s)]
*  Still, do you trust him? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=144.32s)]
*  I think— [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=145.32s)]
*  Do you trust him? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=146.32s)]
*  I don't trust you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=147.32s)]
*  I don't trust a lot of people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=148.32s)]
*  I don't trust you. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=149.32s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=150.32s)]
*  You come in all shooting for bear. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=151.32s)]
*  You're so happy to do the interview. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=152.32s)]
*  I am happy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  And then you start hitting me with fake questions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Fraudulent things were taking place, and we ended that, and those people are going [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=156.27999999999997s)]
*  to be suffering because of it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  A legal note, fraud is a crime. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=162.6s)]
*  There have been no referrals to the Justice Department on any of this. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=164.32s)]
*  Well, you don't know that, do you? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=168.76s)]
*  Are there referrals to the—are there— [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  Why would you know that, that there were no referrals? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=172.84s)]
*  I think there were referrals. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=175.84s)]
*  There's generally—all right, there's been no investigation from the Justice Department. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=176.84s)]
*  How do you know that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=180.12s)]
*  I'm asking you, sir. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=181.12s)]
*  No, you're not asking me. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=182.12s)]
*  You made a statement. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=183.12s)]
*  You're not asking me. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=184.12s)]
*  Now I'm asking you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=185.12s)]
*  That was a statement that you made. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=186.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=188.12s)]
*  Now, that is a beatdown of all beatdowns. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=189.12s)]
*  According to multiple polls, the legacy media mobbed their credibility at an all-time low [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=192.12s)]
*  after getting exposed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  Why over and over and over again by President Trump, and with all they threw at him, he's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=198.4s)]
*  still president? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=204.08s)]
*  Look at your screen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=205.08s)]
*  To commemorate Donald Trump's first hundred days, the White House brilliantly published [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=206.24s)]
*  a massive list of all the hoaxes pushed by the Democrats and the legacy media mob from [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=210.68s)]
*  just the first three months of Trump's second term. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=217.16s)]
*  Let's see, false claims about airplane crashes going up under Trump, a fake story about ICE [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  agents in an elementary school, a phony denial surrounding Biden's very real transgender [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=227.32s)]
*  mouse program, a bogus story from the AP about Tulsi Gabbard and Vladimir Putin, and so much [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=233.24s)]
*  more. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=239.36s)]
*  We'll keep scrolling. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=240.36s)]
*  And despite all the misinformation, all the hysteria, all the breathless reporting that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=241.36s)]
*  is fake and phony and conspiratorial, there's still one group of people that are polling [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=246.08s)]
*  worse tonight. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=251.44s)]
*  Democrats, they're even less trusted than the legacy media mob. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=253.08s)]
*  Chuckie Schumer is polling at a low 17 percent. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=257.32s)]
*  Overall, congressional Democrats have a record low 23 percent approval rating from young [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=261.44s)]
*  Americans, and a new Washington Post poll shows Democrats polling well below President [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=267.12s)]
*  Trump, and many polls have shown the Democrats in general in the 20 percentile range. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  After years of losing battles to Donald Trump, the Democratic Party, well, they've kind of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=277.76s)]
*  lost it all. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=283.12s)]
*  They've become a clown show in the eyes of the American people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=284.12s)]
*  They're not trusted at all. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=287.24s)]
*  They are broken. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=288.82s)]
*  They are soulless and for good reason. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=289.82s)]
*  And here's how President Trump described his unhinged Democratic rivals last night in Michigan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=297.4s)]
*  Some guy that I'd never heard of. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=298.92s)]
*  John James, is he a congressman, this guy? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=301.24s)]
*  He said, he said, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to start the impeachment of Donald [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=311.12s)]
*  What the hell did I do? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=312.12s)]
*  Here we go again. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=313.12s)]
*  They want to impeach me. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=314.12s)]
*  This lunatic. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=315.12s)]
*  This lunatic used up, actually I had the television way down and I said to our great first lady, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=316.12s)]
*  listen, did I just hear I was being impeached again? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=325.2s)]
*  We're getting good at this though. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  No, they've gone totally crazy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  These people, and you know what? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=334.26s)]
*  They've totally lost their confidence. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=335.26s)]
*  They can't even tell a lunatic like this dumb guy that said it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=337.14s)]
*  And then you have the other one that's always with the cane. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=341.78s)]
*  He's always impeaching. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=343.94s)]
*  He raises his cane. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=345.5s)]
*  Enjoy every moment. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=348.5s)]
*  There's nobody else like this guy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=349.5s)]
*  Tonight, there is some good news on the left. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=351.14s)]
*  At least one elected Democrat seems to be coming to her senses. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=353.34s)]
*  You know, the old saying, if you can't beat him, join him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=357.06s)]
*  Well, apparently, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer actually wants manufacturing back [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=359.86s)]
*  in her state of Michigan. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=364.74s)]
*  Good for her. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=366.9s)]
*  Last night, she dared to appear onstage with President Trump. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=367.9s)]
*  And during a big announcement about new state-of-the-art fighter jets for a Michigan air base that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWLlBnCzPKs&t=371.42s)]
