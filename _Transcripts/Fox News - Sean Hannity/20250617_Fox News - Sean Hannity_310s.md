# ‘FOOLS’: Lindsey Graham blasts Iran for attempting to 'manipulate' Trump
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y)
*  Now is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, you know, you were praising the president for his patience and seeking peace and going [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=3.44s)]
*  back to the table and back to the table. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=8.92s)]
*  You can't say that he didn't try to give them an out, an opportunity, knowing what [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=11.28s)]
*  the eventual outcome was going to be. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=16.92s)]
*  And you know, he said, I told them, it's a shame, it's a waste of human life, they [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=20.04s)]
*  can't have a nuclear weapon, and everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=24.28s)]
*  How do you interpret that, sir? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=29.0s)]
*  Well, I take President at his word. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  He gave Iran 60 days to do a deal on 60, the 61st day. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=33.72s)]
*  We are where we are. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  There's two ways to stop Iran from having a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  One is diplomacy, the other is force. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=44.04s)]
*  I think the headline tonight is we're moving into the land of force. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=46.64s)]
*  I think Iran has allowed themselves to be fooled into thinking they could manipulate [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=50.9s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=57.82s)]
*  Same old tactics with the wrong guy when it comes to Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=59.54s)]
*  To all those who voted for President Trump and got him in office, God bless you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=63.26s)]
*  He's the right guy at the right time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=67.58s)]
*  These are dangerous times. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=69.86s)]
*  Why do we say no nuclear weapon for Iran? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=71.18s)]
*  They're a religious theocracy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=74.74s)]
*  They're built around the extreme version of Islam. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=76.82s)]
*  They want to destroy Saudi Arabia and the Sunni branch of Islam. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=79.78s)]
*  They want to kill all the Jews in Israel and come after us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  That's what their whole country is built upon, a theocratic view that there's nobody else [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=87.5s)]
*  in the world but them when it comes to worshiping God. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=92.5s)]
*  If they had a nuclear weapon, they would use it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=95.94s)]
*  Israel believes that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=98.3s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=99.3s)]
*  So here's the task at hand. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=100.3s)]
*  Be all in President Trump in helping Israel eliminate the nuclear threat. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=102.82s)]
*  If we need to provide bombs to Israel, provide bombs. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=107.98s)]
*  If we need to fly planes with Israel, do joint operations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=110.98s)]
*  But here's the bigger question. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=114.54s)]
*  Wouldn't the world be better off if the Ayatollahs went away and replaced by something better? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=116.34s)]
*  Wouldn't Iran be better off? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=121.22s)]
*  Tom Cotton is coming on. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=122.9s)]
*  He made a great observation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=124.54s)]
*  The endless war is Iran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=126.14s)]
*  Since 1979, they've been attacking the entire region, chanting, death to America, death [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=127.9s)]
*  to Israel, since they're very founding. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=132.7s)]
*  It's time to close the chapter on the Iranian Ayatollah and his henchmen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  Let's close that chapter soon and start a new chapter in the Mideast, one of tolerance [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=139.26s)]
*  to hope and peace. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=143.7s)]
*  But the Trump doctrine seems to be very clear tonight, Senator, and that is that Iran cannot [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=145.82s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon, number one, and I agree with that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=151.1s)]
*  And number two, I agree with the president, too, that this is not going to be a forever [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=155.12s)]
*  war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=159.26s)]
*  As Israel now owns the skies over the entire country of Iran, they're basically at the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=160.34s)]
*  mercy now of the Israelis at this point. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  Once the nuclear threat is removed, then the Israelis will have the opportunity to wipe [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=170.82s)]
*  out their entire electric gas-driven electric grid. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=175.7s)]
*  Then they'll also have the opportunity to take away any ability to make money, which [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=179.66s)]
*  it would be to wipe out their refineries. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  It's a matter of whether or not they want to survive as a country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=185.14s)]
*  That seems to be their choice tonight. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=189.26s)]
*  Keeping nuclear weapons does not seem to be on the table any longer. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=194.78s)]
*  I think we've gone from negotiating an end to their nuclear program to ending it by force [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=196.1s)]
*  and hopefully beyond. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  Just think what happened when the Soviet Union collapsed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Ronald Reagan stood up and said, there's an evil empire on the other side of the Berlin [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=205.7s)]
*  Wall. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=211.82s)]
*  Donald Trump has been a man of peace. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=212.82s)]
*  He pursues peace for Russia, Ukraine. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  They tried to get a deal with the Ayatollah, and they miscalculated President Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=217.26s)]
*  So we've got a chance now to close the chapter on the largest state sponsor of terrorism [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  in modern history. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=228.2s)]
*  We've got a chance to end a threat to the state of Israel forever by replacing this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=229.6s)]
*  regime with something better. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=234.28s)]
*  And I do believe the biggest winner of the Ayatollah leaving would be the Iranian people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=236.34s)]
*  So pray for our troops in harm's way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=241.1s)]
*  There are risks associated with any operation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=243.98s)]
*  They joined the military to keep their country safe and to make the world a better place. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=246.6s)]
*  And taking on the Ayatollah does both. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=251.32s)]
*  To our friends in Israel, we have your back. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=253.78s)]
*  We're praying for success. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=256.44s)]
*  You've tolerated too much too long. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=258.28s)]
*  And to the world, you have normalized trying to kill the Jews. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=260.2s)]
*  When Israel's attacked, nobody says a word about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=264.6s)]
*  If France were attacked, what would the French do? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=267.46s)]
*  What would we do? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=269.68s)]
*  So the days of expecting Israel to sit on the sidelines and not go to the heart of the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=270.84s)]
*  beast are over. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=277.23999999999995s)]
*  Take this regime down. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  Make the world a better place. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=281.0s)]
*  Well, they took themselves down. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=282.32s)]
*  Donald Trump, I mean, God bless him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=285.2s)]
*  He's given them every opportunity. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=287.52s)]
*  Look what he was able to pull off with India and Pakistan as that situation was heating [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=289.44s)]
*  up. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=293.84s)]
*  Pretty remarkable as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=294.84s)]
*  Senator Graham, we appreciate your time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moHHYhgjs1Y&t=296.84s)]
