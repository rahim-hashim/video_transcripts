# Top Republican wants these people OUT of Medicaid
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw)
*  Another big win for the president that few of the so-called experts predicted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, the Nasdaq and the S&P hit record highs. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=4.72s)]
*  This comes amid low levels of inflation, low gas prices, high growth projections and a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=9.36s)]
*  booming, booming jobs market. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=14.68s)]
*  One top economist, frequently critical of President Trump, just conceded, quote, maybe [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=17.44s)]
*  the administration has outsmarted all of us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=22.56s)]
*  Joining us now with reaction, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=26.24s)]
*  Senator Blackburn, folks lost their minds after Liberation Day, and they wouldn't [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=31.08s)]
*  even give the president and his team and you and your colleagues in the Senate and the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=35.96s)]
*  House a moment to explain that we're going to raise revenues, we're going to bring [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=40.8s)]
*  people to the table to get bilateral trade deals, we're going to redo globalization [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=44.96s)]
*  so that American industries and American workers, America in itself, are protected and progressed. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  So when you look at these metrics, do you feel vindicated and what's your message [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=55.52s)]
*  to America tonight? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=59.6s)]
*  Oh, yes, indeed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  And President Trump laid out America first. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=62.96s)]
*  And Kellyanne, whether you're talking about the campaign or the transition or going into [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=66.16s)]
*  office, President Donald Trump has exhibited what we call purposeful, intentional leadership. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=73.08s)]
*  He has role modeled that not only for the American people but the world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=80.72s)]
*  And he made promises during the campaign. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=84.88s)]
*  He showed how he was going to make this happen during the transition. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  And starting day one, he has delivered. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=91.08s)]
*  And I know that there were doubters when it came to the tariff policy, but you're so right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Now they're saying he outsmarted them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  And indeed, he had a plan. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  He worked his plan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=108.12s)]
*  He didn't listen to the liberal pundits. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=109.64s)]
*  He just kept moving forward. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=112.28s)]
*  And you're seeing the reaction in the market. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=115.4s)]
*  I think the market also is pricing in the enthusiasm that is anticipation that this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  weekend the Senate will pass the big, beautiful bill, deliver on that largest tax cut in American [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=124.24s)]
*  history. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=132.12s)]
*  And they're assuming in this robust nature of the market that you're going to see consumer [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=133.12s)]
*  spending continue, consumer confidence continue, and you're going to see corporate expansions [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=139.6s)]
*  because of all the credits, the R&D, and the bonus depreciation and the expensing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=147.16s)]
*  And as Katie mentioned, no tax on TIP in overtime and, of course, my bill, no tax on Social [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=153.8s)]
*  Security for our seniors. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=159.68s)]
*  So the enthusiasm is there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  It is there on Main Street. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=164.52s)]
*  You're seeing it on Wall Street. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=166.36s)]
*  And I love the fact that we've got pundits out there that say they were wrong, and indeed, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=168.84s)]
*  President Donald Trump was right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, and it's so difficult to even realize that we're about five months plus into this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=177.28s)]
*  presidency. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=182.72s)]
*  We have three and a half years to go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=183.72s)]
*  Senator Blackburn, in terms of the big, beautiful bill, I think people are getting a little [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  nervous that there have been changes, maybe stops and starts, Oval Office meeting yesterday [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  where some markers were laid down. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=194.0s)]
*  Can you tell us tonight how you're feeling about this? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=197.04s)]
*  You said it should pass the Senate this weekend. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=199.92s)]
*  What do you think will change based on what we know? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=203.0s)]
*  And Kellyanne, we're meeting for lunch at 1. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=206.84s)]
*  The floor is going to open at 2 tomorrow. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=209.44s)]
*  We hope to go to the motion to proceed tomorrow and get on it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=213.12s)]
*  Now, there are a lot of opinions. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=217.52s)]
*  We have been working on this bill since last fall. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  And everybody has had the opportunity to come to the table. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=223.76s)]
*  We're not going to get everything we want, but bear in mind the largest tax cut in history. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=227.6s)]
*  Tennesseans are going to see about a $2,600 reduction in their taxes through this bill. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=235.16s)]
*  You're going to see wages rise. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=241.88s)]
*  You are going to see all of the attention being put on this economic growth. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=244.44s)]
*  Now, I do want to say some people say, well, you know, what about Medicare and Medicaid? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=252.32s)]
*  We're strengthening those programs because if you're a freeloader, a fraudster or an [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=257.12s)]
*  illegal alien, we want to get you out of those programs and strengthen them and preserve [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=263.64s)]
*  them for the people that they are there to benefit. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=270.16s)]
*  And we're determined to deliver on President Trump's agenda. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=274.24s)]
*  And you know, this is a great start. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  This will be the foundational bill. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  There is quite a bit of enthusiasm on Capitol Hill to get this done. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=286.28s)]
*  And I fully believe the president will be signing this bill on July 4th. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's an exciting update from Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=297.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNEWRCMsfw&t=301.24s)]
