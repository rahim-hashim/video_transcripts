# Why US-Ukraine minerals deal is a ‘WIN-WIN’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE)
*  And this is a Fox News Alert, major breaking news out of Washington tonight, where the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. Treasury Department just announced the creation of the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Investment Fund. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=11.24s)]
*  Now, this is part of that Ukraine minerals deal that the administration has been working [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=12.24s)]
*  on for months. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=16.36s)]
*  And here with the details is the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, is with us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=17.88s)]
*  Scott, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=21.36s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=22.52s)]
*  This is a big deal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=23.88s)]
*  It's a good—it's good for America. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=25.7s)]
*  It's good for Ukraine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=27.88s)]
*  I believe it also will be good for Europe in a lot of ways. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=30.08s)]
*  And tell us the details of that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=33.24s)]
*  Sean, it's a great deal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=35.56s)]
*  Thanks for having me on tonight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=38.12s)]
*  And look, this is President Trump's deal, that he's done trade deals, tax deals, and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=40.0s)]
*  now we've got this Ukrainian-American economic partnership deal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=47.56s)]
*  And it's win-win. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=53.16s)]
*  It is a way to show that there's no daylight between Ukraine and U.S. as President Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=55.16s)]
*  presses to end this horrible war. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  He wants both sides to come to the table now by showing that the U.S. has an economic interest [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  It's a signal to the Russian leadership. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  It's also a signal to the American people that we have a chance to participate, get [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=78.24s)]
*  some of our—the funding and the weapons, compensation for those, and be partners with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  the success of the Ukraine people, bring American know-how, best practices to the rebuilt Ukraine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  But the rebuilding can't stop until this war ends, and President Trump is committed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=98.84s)]
*  to that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the world should be applauding it, and the president expressed cautious optimism [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  earlier today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=109.2s)]
*  Let's talk about the state of these trade deals with other countries and the issue of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=110.84s)]
*  tariffs and where do we stand now, and do you expect that a lot of deals will be signed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=117.0s)]
*  in the near future? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=121.12s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, what I believe—and you can see it—the president had this incredible first [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=122.12s)]
*  hundred days. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Just look at the success of the border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=131.4s)]
*  Now we closed the first hundred days with this deal, where President Trump is the first [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=133.92s)]
*  president to create assets rather than debt for the American people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Now we're moving on to the trade deals, and President Trump has created the maximum [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=146.2s)]
*  optionality, maximum pressure for our trading partners. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  And by showing the high level of tariffs from April 2nd that are possible, they've all [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=158.36s)]
*  come to the table to negotiate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=166.16s)]
*  So we've got 18 important trading partners. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=168.96s)]
*  We put China to the side. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Seventeen have not escalated. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=174.56s)]
*  We are in negotiations with them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=177.4s)]
*  There's a process in place. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=179.96s)]
*  But what President Trump has kept in his back pocket— [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=182.36s)]
*  All 17? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  What's that, Sean? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  All 17? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=188.72s)]
*  All 17 have approached us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  We are batching them in groups at a time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=192.92s)]
*  But we've had a hundred approach us, and we are working with the top 17 to try to move [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=198.0s)]
*  them as long as quickly as possible. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=205.92s)]
*  And knowing that their levels could ratchet back up to the April 2nd tariff level has [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=209.0s)]
*  made everyone come to the table with some, what I would say are very good proposals. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=216.52s)]
*  So of America, if the president's successful in getting free and fair trade, is successful [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=223.44s)]
*  in accomplishing energy dominance, is successful in eliminating waste, fraud and abuse with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=229.76s)]
*  Doge, and you add to that his tax cuts being permanent, you know a lot more about the economy [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=235.36s)]
*  than I do, but that seems like a prescription for economic dominance and great success and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=242.68s)]
*  opportunity, especially high-paying career jobs for working Americans. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=249.68s)]
*  Am I wrong on any part of that? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=253.24s)]
*  No, Sean, we're putting together this plan and executing on it day by day, week by week, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=255.48s)]
*  and it doesn't all happen at once, but the first hundred days set the table for the successes [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=265.32s)]
*  that we're going to see in the next hundred. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  We've got, I can't remember, the number keeps going up every day, whether it's six, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=275.6s)]
*  seven, we might be up to eight trillion of companies, sovereign funds that want to come [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=281.0s)]
*  to the U.S., businesses that want to reshore, but the important thing, none of these trade [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=286.56s)]
*  deals are going to get done unless they're fair. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  And as the other countries come to us, I look at these deals, and some of them are very [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=296.88s)]
*  good deals, and I couldn't agree more with President Trump. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm not mad at the tariffs and the barriers and the currency manipulations that the other [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=307.2s)]
*  countries are doing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=313.44s)]
*  I just wonder how it went on for four or five decades without anyone who'd been behind [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  the resolute desk doing anything about it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=321.12s)]
*  No president has—this has gone on for 50 or 60 years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=324.44s)]
*  We have been ripped off, we've been abused, taken advantage of. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  No president dared to challenge the establishment institutionalist thinking. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=331.28s)]
*  And I agree with you, I believe, if these deals come in, and hopefully fast and furious, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  with Trump being fair and fair, I think it'll be great for the country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Besant, thank you very much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-hwDzlkiJE&t=348.0s)]
