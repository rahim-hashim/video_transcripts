# The AOC-led Democratic Party fights for illegal aliens: Stephen Miller
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84)
*  Deputy Chief of Policy Homeland Security Advisor, our friend Stephen Miller. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, how are you? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=4.76s)]
*  Hey, my friend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=5.76s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=6.76s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=7.76s)]
*  Thanks for coming to Washington. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=8.76s)]
*  If you could bear being in the swamp. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=9.76s)]
*  I could barely—I take it for less than 24 hours, and I get the hell home. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=10.76s)]
*  Back to the free state of Florida. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=14.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=15.8s)]
*  Listen, if AOC is their choice, if they really want to stand up for this guy that two judges [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=16.8s)]
*  said had ties to MS-13, if that's their cause to lab, fine. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=23.32s)]
*  I'm fine with it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=27.72s)]
*  Sean, we've reached a point in American politics where we have one party, led by President [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=29.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, that fights for Americans, and a second party, I guess led by AOC, that fights [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=33.44s)]
*  for illegal aliens. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=39.2s)]
*  But not just illegal aliens. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=40.2s)]
*  Criminal, wife-beating, terrorist illegal aliens. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=42.0s)]
*  Two immigration judges, as you said, found that he was a member of MS-13, as did the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=47.08s)]
*  arresting police department here nearby in Prince George's County. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=51.42s)]
*  On top of that, we have, of course, the protective order filed by his wife, alleging horrific [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=56.0s)]
*  multiple instances. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  Two of them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  There were two? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  Yes, of extreme violent physical abuse. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=64.16s)]
*  And then on top of all of that, he's an illegal alien and a member of what has been designated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=66.6s)]
*  as a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=71.56s)]
*  You have the entire machinery of the Democrat Party using all of its power not to fight [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=73.88s)]
*  for lower costs, as President Trump is, or better trade deals, as President Trump is, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  or lower taxes, as President Trump is, but to fight to bring this illegal alien with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=83.4s)]
*  all those horrific crimes and allegations and history against him back to the United [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  States where he can do what? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  He can commit additional acts that threaten the safety of the American people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=93.48s)]
*  This is the biggest, sharpest contrast you will ever see between the priorities of President [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=97.72s)]
*  Trump and the priorities of the Democrat Party. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=101.92s)]
*  Do you think AOC will be the nominee in 28? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=104.44s)]
*  I think she's clearly the front-runner, and I think it's just emblematic of the fact [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=108.4s)]
*  the Democrat Party has been thoroughly, completely radicalized. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=111.72000000000001s)]
*  They're an open borders party. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=115.84s)]
*  They're a communist party. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=117.2s)]
*  They're a party that excuses violence and left-wing terrorism. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=118.48s)]
*  They're a party that's pulling at 21 percent. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=121.84s)]
*  But if they keep fighting to spring illegal alien gang members loose from foreign countries [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=124.06s)]
*  and bring them back to terrorize our families, that 21 percent will go down to 15 and 10 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=128.96s)]
*  percent and lower and lower, because Americans, above all else, expect their government to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=133.72s)]
*  keep them safe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=137.86s)]
*  And Donald Trump is fighting harder to keep our families safe than anyone who has ever [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=139.12s)]
*  sat behind that resolute desk. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  Steve Miller, great to see you in person. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate you being with us as always. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oes3CefLy84&t=147.20000000000002s)]
