# ‘GAME ROOM IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL: Sen. Kennedy fillets Dems on the state of their party
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY)
*  First, joining us now with his thoughts on President Trump's momentous 100 days is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=0.0s)]
*  Louisiana Senator John Kennedy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=6.08s)]
*  You know, Senator, as I reflect back on this 100 days, as I watch tonight's rally with [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=7.8s)]
*  the president of Michigan, there really is only one Donald Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=12.4s)]
*  You know, I remember after Reagan was president, you know, Republicans tried to sound like [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=16.2s)]
*  Reagan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=20.64s)]
*  They used the same words as Reagan, but they weren't Reagan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=21.64s)]
*  And I think we're seeing a moment in history where you have a guy that really is disrupting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=24.72s)]
*  that place that you work in, in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  It is shock and awe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=34.92s)]
*  He's iconoclastic and he's looking at everything anew. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=36.6s)]
*  And I like a lot. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=39.8s)]
*  I like all of what he's doing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=40.8s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=41.8s)]
*  Well, let me start with my Democratic colleagues. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=42.8s)]
*  A charitable interpretation of the behavior of the Democratic Party may exist, but I [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=50.08s)]
*  can't think of one. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=57.88s)]
*  I think most fair-minded Americans think today's Democratic Party looks like the game room [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=61.36s)]
*  in a mental hospital. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=68.44s)]
*  It's exquisitely shambolic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  The only thing the Democrats contribute to the discussion is just a bunch of rabid barking. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=77.4s)]
*  Many Democrats still, they still drink their caramel Frappuccinos and they carry their [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  NPR tote bags, but their ideas are either non-existent or they're shallow and their [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=92.92s)]
*  passions are immature. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  The Democratic Party today is not defined by its principles. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=104.4s)]
*  It's defined by one thing, its hatred of President Trump, even when he's right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=111.0s)]
*  For example, in the first hundred days, President Trump secured the board. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=116.64s)]
*  The Democrats were opposed. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=122.84s)]
*  In his first hundred days, President Trump got rid of racial quotas. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  The Democratic Party was opposed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=129.44s)]
*  In his first hundred days, President Trump started deregulating the economy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=131.84s)]
*  You mentioned it, Sean, getting rid of rules and regulations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=136.76s)]
*  The Democrats were opposed and are opposed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=140.8s)]
*  The President began the process, he and Mr. Musk, of scrubbing the budget, getting rid [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=143.84s)]
*  of the spending porn. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=149.76s)]
*  The Democrats were opposed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=151.44s)]
*  The President, in his first hundred days, has backed Israel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=153.84s)]
*  He stood up to China. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=157.84s)]
*  He stood up to Iran. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=159.8s)]
*  The Democrats were opposed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=163.72s)]
*  And the final point I would make that I haven't heard anybody talk about today is Europe. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=165.88000000000002s)]
*  The President Trump has changed Europe. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  The Democrats were opposed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  We both know, Sean, that President Trump, he exists loudly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  And his loud existence has awakened the Europeans from their slumber with respect to their economic [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=185.28s)]
*  model and their national defense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=193.32s)]
*  The Europeans are nine times richer than the Russians. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=199.52s)]
*  Why should Americans have to pay for their national defense? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=204.24s)]
*  The President has demanded a change there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=210.36s)]
*  I don't mean to be unkind, but, you know, I would rather watch reruns of The View for [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=214.4s)]
*  the rest of eternity than to listen to some of my Democratic colleagues. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=224.52s)]
*  And I think I'm pretty tolerant. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  You mean you don't like the sing-alongs and the slogans and the performative art? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=232.24s)]
*  You're not a big supporter of the bingo paddles? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=237.24s)]
*  You know, it's amazing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  I watch them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  They have no introspection, no change of course on their part. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=241.76s)]
*  They still champion men's rights to play women's sports. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=244.6s)]
*  They were even standing up for MS-13 gang members and Trendy Aragon gang members and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=249.2s)]
*  their so-called rights over the safety of Americans. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=254.24s)]
*  They think it's a constitutional crisis if you cut out waste, fraud and abuse and corruption. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=257.16s)]
*  And then they wouldn't stand for mothers that lost their children at the joint session. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=264.34s)]
*  That spoke volumes to me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=268.24s)]
*  They wouldn't stand for a young man that beat cancer or the wife of a slain hero. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=270.12s)]
*  And it's now the party of AOC and, you know, Grandpa Bernie and the Squad and, oh, Jasmine [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=277.2s)]
*  Crockett. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=283.52s)]
*  Those seem to be the emerging leaders. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=284.88s)]
*  Your thoughts on them? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=286.56s)]
*  Well, I think Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is the leader of the Democratic Party today. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=287.92s)]
*  Some might say Senator Schumer, but I think it's Congress. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=297.02s)]
*  Schumer's had a 17% approval rating today. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=300.82s)]
*  17. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=304.14s)]
*  Democrats are in their 20s. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=305.14s)]
*  I think it's Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=308.34s)]
*  And as I said before, she's entitled to her opinions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=312.82s)]
*  You know, my personal opinion is that God gave her a billy goat brain and a mockingbird [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=317.18s)]
*  mouth. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=324.53999999999996s)]
*  You know? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, look, I believe in the power of ideas. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=327.06s)]
*  And my Democratic colleagues have no ideas. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=331.74s)]
*  All they have is hatred for one man, even when he's right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's President Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=339.86s)]
*  And I don't think that's healthy for them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=340.86s)]
*  I don't think that's healthy for America. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=343.06s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  You're probably the most quotable senator in Washington. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=347.58000000000004s)]
*  And that's a compliment. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=350.42s)]
*  Senator Kennedy always appreciate it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=352.22s)]
*  It's a whole bar, Sean. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=353.22s)]
*  It's a very low bar. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  That's probably true, too, actually. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=356.78s)]
*  Senator, appreciate you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_kEsz-SMY&t=358.78s)]
