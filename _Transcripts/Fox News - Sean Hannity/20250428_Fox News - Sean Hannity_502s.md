# President Trump has 'totally broken' the Democratic Party in 100 days
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM)
*  Our top story tonight, the week we reach is a milestone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=0.0s)]
*  The first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term, Democrats, the state-run legacy media [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=4.0s)]
*  mob, they're not taking it well. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=9.52s)]
*  They need help. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=11.84s)]
*  They need therapy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=12.84s)]
*  On Sunday, Spartacus and several other Democratic lawmakers sat on the Capitol steps for 12 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=13.84s)]
*  hours for a public therapy session. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  They had singing and everything. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=22.72s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=24.84s)]
*  This is a time to choose. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=26.2s)]
*  And we're either going to choose the side of the American people or we're going to choose [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=28.46s)]
*  this cruel budget that Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  We can't keep doing things like business as usual. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=38.44s)]
*  We have to think of creative new things to do. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=43.0s)]
*  And so Akeem and I thought, let's sit on the steps of the Capitol. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=46.04s)]
*  Think about what the framers did to try to make the president not a king, not to have [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=50.24s)]
*  a unitary executive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  And Trump is doing the exact opposite. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  And what Grant said is there are but two parties in America right now, patriots and traitors. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=62.64s)]
*  I will build this world from love. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=72.8s)]
*  I will build this world from love. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=77.0s)]
*  Not too bad. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=80.6s)]
*  Ya da da, ya da da, ya da da, ya da da. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=82.6s)]
*  Ya da da, ya da da, ya da da da. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=86.8s)]
*  OK, cruel budget that robs from your children and grandchildren. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=92.8s)]
*  You heard all that right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=96.44s)]
*  Amid all the singing and the whining, the highest ranking Democratic member of the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=98.16s)]
*  House said, quote, there are but two parties in America right now, patriots and traitors. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=102.44s)]
*  Which party am I a part of? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  I'd like to be a patriot. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=109.84s)]
*  But wait, it gets worse. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has big dreams of one day becoming president. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  By the way, he'll be about as lucky as Gavin Newsom. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=117.64s)]
*  And over the weekend in New Hampshire, the governor all but threatened half the country [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=121.24s)]
*  of violence. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=125.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=126.0s)]
*  Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=127.16s)]
*  But I am now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=134.0s)]
*  These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=137.48s)]
*  They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=142.12s)]
*  that we have. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=146.98s)]
*  We must castigate them on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=148.04s)]
*  Not a moment's of peace. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=154.44s)]
*  None. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=155.8s)]
*  But it's not the obvious here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  Democratic Party is not democratic at all. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=158.28s)]
*  After losing an election to President Trump, after he was shot and survived two assassination [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=160.96s)]
*  attempts, two would-be assassins, Democrats have since invoked a civil war. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  They have called for chaos. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  They have encouraged their followers to riot, applauded acts of violence and, frankly, domestic [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  terrorism against Teslas, their owners. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=177.84s)]
*  Low-level far-left judges have also waged an unprecedented level of lawfare against [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=181.08s)]
*  our Constitution, the executive rights that are endowed to a duly elected president and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=186.84s)]
*  the Trump agenda. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  And, of course, Democrats, they have already filed impeachment articles against the president, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  yet again. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=198.52s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=199.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  This is Congressman Shri Thanedar. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=202.4s)]
*  Donald Trump has already done real damage to our democracy, but defying a unanimous [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=204.92s)]
*  9-0 Supreme Court ruling? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=211.48s)]
*  That has to be the final straw. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=214.6s)]
*  It's time we impeach Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  Today, I introduced a resolution to impeach Donald J. Trump, outlining seven articles [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=219.72s)]
*  of impeachment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=228.56s)]
*  I won't be silent, and I'm calling on all my colleagues, Democrats, Republicans and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=230.12s)]
*  independents, to stand up with me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=236.56s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=239.68s)]
*  OK, it's not just the idiotic Democrats in the House and the Senate. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  Georgia Senator John Ossoff is also calling for the president's impeachment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=246.68s)]
*  Look at this exchange. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  Why are there no calls for impeachment? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=253.28s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=256.16s)]
*  I will not live in an authoritative country, and neither will any of these people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  You can do more. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  There is no doubt that this president's conduct has already exceeded any prior standard for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=264.48s)]
*  impeachment by the United States House of Representatives. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  Brian Campbell wiped the floor with him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=276.68s)]
*  They literally do not care at all about the quality of your life or the will of the American [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=278.48s)]
*  people. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  Instead, it's day in, day out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  Democrats obsessed with getting revenge, overturning the results of the last election. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=286.4s)]
*  The Democrats, they have their first 100-day verdict, and that's in, and it is a disaster. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=291.28s)]
*  Multiple polls now have them in the 20s. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=298.08s)]
*  The country has witnessed nothing but a bunch of petulant children embracing irrational [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=300.2s)]
*  anger, extreme radicalism, with pointless sit-ins, chanting and singing and dropping [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=304.96s)]
*  F-bomb after F-bomb after F-bomb, and of course their bingo paddles and their inability to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  stand for mothers that lost children or a young man that beat cancer. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=316.04s)]
*  And perhaps no one in the entire country has been more obsessed with getting Trump than [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  the congenital liar himself, Adam Schiff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  But recently, after a short stint in his own state, he went to Target. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=327.44s)]
*  Somebody robbed his car. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=332.0s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=333.16s)]
*  Even Schiff seemed to realize that his party has gone completely off the rails. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=334.16s)]
*  Nice of him to finally go to a Target. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=341.36s)]
*  I went to this Target in South San Francisco, 10 o'clock at night, and I'm getting the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=342.48s)]
*  toiletries I'm going to need for my next two days in the city. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=349.92s)]
*  I had to get the clerk, which is hard to find, to unlock the shampoo or whatever. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=359.76s)]
*  And then I get to the cashier. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=360.76s)]
*  The cashier asked me if I want one of those Target bags with a little bullseye on it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=361.76s)]
*  And I said, yes, that Target bag is going to be my luggage for the next two days. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  And she asked me what happened, and I told her and basically said, in not so many words, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=371.16s)]
*  yeah, Democrats are a*****. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=376.04s)]
*  And I thought, you know, if the cashier in South San Francisco at 10 o'clock at night [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=378.92s)]
*  believes that Democrats are a***** because the shampoo was locked up and my stuff got [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=383.26s)]
*  stolen out of the trunk, we've got a major problem. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=389.2s)]
*  He's a senator from the state. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=393.72s)]
*  How could he not know all that was going on in his state? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=395.66s)]
*  And I have bad news for my friends in California. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=399.3s)]
*  Nothing's going to get better with the likes of Adam Schiff, radical Gavin Newsom or any [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=402.42s)]
*  other Democrat in charge of that state. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=407.26s)]
*  Their policies, their beliefs are insane. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=409.18s)]
*  And as we speak tonight, with few exceptions, there are really only two types of Democrats, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=411.58000000000004s)]
*  far-left losers obsessed with hating Donald Trump and are petrified of their ultra-radical [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  woke base and that ultra-radical base led by the squad AOC, Grandpa Bernie, Jasmine [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=422.34s)]
*  Crockett. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=428.97999999999996s)]
*  Their bizarre focus is on Green New Deal communism, the so-called fight the oligarchy. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=430.06s)]
*  Now there's a civil war brewing between the radical and the super radical sides of the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=436.26s)]
*  Democratic Party, but there's no moderates left. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=441.14s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=443.38s)]
*  Let me ask you about something that your colleague, Senator Alyssa Slotkin, said. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NV4EL8rjKM&t=444.82s)]
