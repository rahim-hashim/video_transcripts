# Trump won't settle for this, Hannity says
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, a bold new chapter in our nation's storied history is unfolding right before [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=2.68s)]
*  your eyes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=7.18s)]
*  A major trade deal with the U.K. is the first of many to come. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=8.18s)]
*  The economy is on the mend. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=11.64s)]
*  Law and order is being restored coast to coast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=13.52s)]
*  Left-wing agitators, they are finally facing consequences, including deportation in spite [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=16.76s)]
*  of lawfare. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Our crumbling infrastructure that pothole Pete ignored and degraded for years is finally [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=23.84s)]
*  getting the attention it deserves. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  We need the skies to be safe. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  And as per usual, Joe Biden is completely oblivious to all of it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=34.739999999999995s)]
*  We'll show you the sad interview that he and Dr. Jill Biden had on that hard-hitting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=38.26s)]
*  news show. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=44.26s)]
*  But we begin with today's massive announcement. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=45.26s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  This morning, I'm thrilled to announce that we have reached a breakthrough trade deal [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  with the United Kingdom, a credible country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=52.86s)]
*  Today is a victory day for World War II. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=57.26s)]
*  We won the war together exactly 80 years ago, so there could be no more perfect morning [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=60.54s)]
*  to reach this historic agreement. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=66.62s)]
*  And it's beautiful weather out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=68.46s)]
*  I will tell you that, Keir, beautiful weather. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=69.66s)]
*  So perfect outside. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=71.74s)]
*  But it's really, in particular, the agreement with one of our closest and most cherished [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=74.22s)]
*  allies. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=80.5s)]
*  And we're so happy that that's the way it worked out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=82.7s)]
*  I want to thank Prime Minister Stammer and his very talented team for their outstanding [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  work and partnership. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=91.22s)]
*  Today's agreement with the UK is the first in a series of agreements on trade that my [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=93.66s)]
*  administration has been negotiating over the past four weeks. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  With this deal, the UK joins the United States in affirming that reciprocity and fairness [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=102.78s)]
*  is an essential and vital principle of international trade. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=108.54s)]
*  Clearly, President Trump's manifest destiny. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  Bold new trade deals with every country around the world. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=117.34s)]
*  And today, it started with our closest ally. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=120.22s)]
*  Now, this deal cuts red tape between our two countries. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=122.54s)]
*  It fast-tracks trade through customs. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=125.86s)]
*  It also eliminates British tariffs on American steel, aluminum, and opens the British market [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=128.26s)]
*  to American ethanol, agriculture, machinery. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=133.62s)]
*  In response, the Dow, S&P, NASDAQ all rallied today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=137.06s)]
*  The markets now have been up 13 out of the past 15 trading days. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=140.98s)]
*  Funny how the mainstream media doesn't report that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  Now, the highly respected Atlanta Fed raised its quarterly growth projections, and just [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=147.7s)]
*  this week, it more than doubled to 2.3 percent from a week ago. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=153.26s)]
*  Also, Goldman Sachs fears a recession are subsiding. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=158.62s)]
*  Non-stop hand-wringing from the legacy media mob and Democrats was, yet again, totally [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=162.26s)]
*  unfounded and ridiculous. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=168.54s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, this is only one deal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=170.54s)]
*  This is only the beginning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=172.74s)]
*  And remember, on Saturday, Scott Besson will be meeting in Geneva with China representatives. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=174.26s)]
*  According to my sources, there are, in fact, numerous major agreements in the pipeline. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=179.86s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Besson is saying deals with 18 countries, big countries, currently [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=184.62s)]
*  in the works. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=189.24s)]
*  Now, analysts at Goldman Sachs are even predicting a looming deal with the People's Republic [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=190.24s)]
*  of China. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=194.22s)]
*  Scott Besson, Chinese representatives, they will have that meeting on Saturday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=195.22s)]
*  And just off the coast, Taiwan is not even waiting for a new deal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=199.66000000000003s)]
*  China Airlines just ordered 14 brand-new Boeing 777 planes with options for many more. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=203.58s)]
*  Here's my message to the Democratic Party, the legacy media mob. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Nobody cares about your doom and gloom and your hope and prayer for American failure. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=215.3s)]
*  The American people elected a disruptor to the White House, someone who was not afraid [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=220.22000000000003s)]
*  someone who wouldn't settle for the status quo, for the institutionalism that is rotting [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=225.46s)]
*  D.C. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=231.5s)]
*  And that's exactly what the American people are getting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=232.5s)]
*  For 50 to 60 years, America has been ripped off and abused and taken advantage of, and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=235.06s)]
*  Donald Trump has said, enough's enough. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=240.38s)]
*  And by the way, this is for the American economy, American manufacturing and the people that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=242.94s)]
*  make this country great, American workers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=249.3s)]
*  Now, remember, his threat of tariffs also resulted in over $8 trillion in commitments [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=251.82000000000002s)]
*  for manufacturing over the next four years in sectors where we need it—cars, pharmaceuticals, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  chips and much, much more. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=263.5s)]
*  We don't need to be dependent on any other country ever. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=265.66s)]
*  And now our country has a chance to be better than ever before, from sea to shining sea, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=268.62s)]
*  from the Arctic to the Gulf of America. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=274.18s)]
*  In case you missed it, by the way, the House, they just passed legislation, angry Democrats [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=277.66s)]
*  officially renaming the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=282.26s)]
*  Naturally, every Democrat voted against it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=284.82s)]
*  What are they for anyway? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHc8_VOgH4&t=287.34000000000003s)]
