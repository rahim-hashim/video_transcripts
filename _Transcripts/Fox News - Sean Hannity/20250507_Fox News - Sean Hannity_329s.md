# 'Politically motivated': FBI accused of 'butchering' Steve Scalise shooting probe
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U)
*  A bombshell, new report from the House Judiciary Committee outlined some shocking allegations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=0.0s)]
*  about the 2017 Congressional baseball shooting during which Steve Scalise nearly lost his [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=6.88s)]
*  life. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=12.32s)]
*  Now, according to the report, the FBI butchered the probe into the shooting, downplayed the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=13.32s)]
*  anti-Republican motives of the shooter, and instead shockingly classifying it as a suicide [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=17.92s)]
*  by cop attempt. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=24.52s)]
*  A notion that Steve Scalise, understandably, has now taken great offense to, and who can [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=25.92s)]
*  blame him? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=30.96s)]
*  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan joins us now, along with House Majority Leader [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=31.96s)]
*  Steve Scalise. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=36.28s)]
*  Steve, this is personal for you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=37.28s)]
*  I want to get to you in a second. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=39.040000000000006s)]
*  Jim Jordan first. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  What did we discover? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=42.32s)]
*  And is the reason they flat out lied to us? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=43.92s)]
*  Was it done for political reasons? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  Because they didn't want to make the Democrats look bad? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=52.24s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=53.24s)]
*  I mean, Sean, the guy who shoots Steve has a piece of paper in his pocket, a hit list [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=54.56s)]
*  with the names and descriptions of six other members of Congress. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  He's not a domestic terrorist, but pro-life Catholics are. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=64.6s)]
*  That was the mindset at the FBI before Cash Patel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=68.64s)]
*  That was their mindset. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=72.16s)]
*  And so they have to label this something different because it doesn't fit the narrative. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=73.36s)]
*  It doesn't fit the right-wing MAGA hillbillies in flyover country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=77.8s)]
*  They're the domestic terrorists. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  And so they label it something else. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=83.96s)]
*  And it was complete BS. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=84.96s)]
*  Never forget the disdain that they have for regular Americans. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=86.52s)]
*  Remember Peter Struck, that text message he sends to Lisa Page where he says, I'm in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=90.0s)]
*  the Walmart and I can smell the Trump supporters? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  So that's what the information we finally get because Cash Patel released the entire [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  case file and we could look at it all. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=101.6s)]
*  The Intel committee could look at it all. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  And they did great work exposing the ridiculous stuff that Andy McCabe, Jim Comey, and Chris [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=105.8s)]
*  Ray, how they ran the FBI. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=112.68s)]
*  And what a difference now with Cash Patel running that place. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=115.04s)]
*  This has got to be personal for you, Steve. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=118.44s)]
*  I mean, to this day, you still suffer the effects of that shooting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=121.04s)]
*  I know you've healed considerably, a lot of rehab. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=125.8s)]
*  You're lucky to be here today in many ways. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=129.12s)]
*  And now you find out you were lied to at a very high level. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=133.16s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=136.2s)]
*  Well, Sean, you know, God answered a lot of prayers that day. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=137.2s)]
*  When the FBI initially pulled those of us from the baseball shooting into a hearing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=141.28s)]
*  after we got out of the hospital, they called it suicide by cop. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=147.4s)]
*  We were so offended, we walked out of the hearing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=151.28s)]
*  We said, how can you call that suicide by cop when he tried to kill the two cops that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=153.12s)]
*  were with me that day? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  David Bailey and Crystal Griner were both shot during the shootout and the shooter tried [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=159.0s)]
*  to kill all of us that day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  And it was politically motivated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=165.72s)]
*  And yet in their report, they said it wasn't politically motivated. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, they withheld facts that the shooter had on his person that showed that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=170.32s)]
*  he had political motivations to then say falsely that it wasn't politically motivated. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, this begs the question, why was the FBI trying to mislead back in 2017? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=181.72s)]
*  I applaud Cash Patel for getting the facts out and getting the record corrected. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=186.92s)]
*  But the FBI in 2017 falsely put out information. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=192.04s)]
*  Look, Jim Jordan's name was on that shooter's hit list, too. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=195.52s)]
*  And he had very, very dire intentions to kill Republicans. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=199.16s)]
*  That's what he said he wanted to do. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=204.4s)]
*  It wasn't suicide by cop. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=206.48s)]
*  And yet the report by the FBI initially tried to claim it was. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=208.56s)]
*  It was false. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=211.92s)]
*  Will the lies, Jim Jordan and the people that politicized and weaponized the FBI, these [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=212.92s)]
*  people ever going to be held accountable or will they just get away with it all? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=219.32s)]
*  Well, let's hope they don't get away with it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=225.48s)]
*  I think just the fact that we're exposing the truth and God bless Steve for what he [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=226.84s)]
*  endured. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=230.48s)]
*  God bless those Capitol Hill police who came to the rescue that day. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=231.48s)]
*  But that at that time frame from 17 all the way until now, what the FBI did. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, think about all the things we saw, Sean. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=240.24s)]
*  This guy wasn't a domestic terrorist, but moms and dads at school board meetings need [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=242.44s)]
*  to be investigated. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=246.12s)]
*  Pro-life Catholics are domestic violent extremists. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=247.4s)]
*  That's what the that's the term the FBI used. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=249.88s)]
*  I mean, it's just they raided President Trump's home on and on. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=252.12s)]
*  You could go. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=255.2s)]
*  So I think just now telling the country how bad it was and thanking the good Lord that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=256.36s)]
*  we now also have someone running the Justice Department, running the FBI, who understands [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  how that organization is supposed to operate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=266.36s)]
*  Was it a matter of policy that they just lied to us, Steve? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=269.48s)]
*  Well, they lied to us deliberately. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=273.68s)]
*  And again, they not only lied, they withheld information. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=275.52s)]
*  I read the report over the weekend that they leaked out and they finally showed the country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=278.72s)]
*  There were things in that report I had never seen, not even in 2017, that were deliberately [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=284.04s)]
*  withheld by the FBI. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=288.68s)]
*  Again, Cash Patel finally got it out there so the public can see what really happened. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=290.2s)]
*  They should have done that in 2017. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=294.76s)]
*  Those people need to be held accountable, Sean. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=296.6s)]
*  Yeah, they definitely do. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, we're glad you made it through. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=300.64s)]
*  It was touch and go there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=302.72s)]
*  I remember at the time getting calls saying that you were right there on Death's Door [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  by a number of people and it turned out you were. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  God perform very well that day, Sean. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  Amen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmGuENDeS6U&t=316.96000000000004s)]
