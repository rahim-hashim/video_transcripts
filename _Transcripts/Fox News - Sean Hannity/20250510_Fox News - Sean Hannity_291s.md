# Dems are turning on Fetterman: Kellyanne Conway
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE)
*  All right, joining us now, Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway and former Democratic advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=0.0s)]
*  Dan Turrentine is with us. All right, Dan, it's your party. You can cry if you want to. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=6.16s)]
*  Is this the path towards the reemergence of your party? Is the future of your party the squad, AOC, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=14.48s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett and Grandpa Bernie? I sure hope not. I mean, look, we are a party right now that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=21.6s)]
*  is completely leaderless. I mean, in normal times it would be Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=28.48s)]
*  but both of them are terrified of our base. I mean, they are paralyzed with fear. Chuck Schumer is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=34.64s)]
*  down 20 points here in New York to AOC if there was a primary today. And on top of that, we don't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=39.92s)]
*  have an agenda at all. You know, all we really have that holds us together is the dislike of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=46.64s)]
*  Donald Trump. And, you know, we saw how that went in November. And so, you know, for us to ultimately [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=53.52s)]
*  move forward, we have to come up with a real agenda that helps the real lives of real people, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  even on tariffs. We're not against reshoring jobs here. We're not against opening new markets. We [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=64.48s)]
*  may quiver with how Trump is going about it. But if he starts putting more points on the board, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=71.2s)]
*  he's going to get credit and the American people aren't really going to care about the process [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  the last few months. Okay. Did I just hear a reasonable Democrat, Kellyanne? Will you help [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=80.08s)]
*  interpret that for me? Wow. Because that he is not representative of the Democratic Party that I know [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=86.08s)]
*  today. Maybe him, Mark Penn, maybe a couple, but not many. They are few and far between because [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=91.6s)]
*  there's very little ideological diversity within the Democratic Party. They don't have unity. They [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=99.28s)]
*  have unanimity. They all vote the same way at the same time. And that's really the challenge for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=104.48s)]
*  John Fetterman. You know, Sean, we were together three years ago when they were he was running [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=108.96s)]
*  against Oz in 2022. Everyone knew that John Fetterman had suffered a stroke. They turned [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  him into a Feddy John folk hero. The Senate changed the dress code for him. And it wasn't until [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=118.96s)]
*  John Fetterman, his hoodie and his wife, hightailed the tomorrow logo and dare meet with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  President Trump to find out how maybe they can work together to serve the people of Pennsylvania, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=130.56s)]
*  a state at Commonwealth that both John Fetterman and Donald Trump won in their respective races. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=135.04s)]
*  He's pro-Israel. He questions a crisis at the border. And because of what the gentleman just [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  said, the Democrats turned against him and they're slandering him. They're libeling him in this new [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  hit piece. And it's all because he refuses to go along with the crowd. And, you know, this is a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  party that can't get rid of Joe Biden. It's almost a year since they jettisoned him after that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  ridiculous debate performance against President Trump. And they can't quit him. He was on The [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=161.84s)]
*  View yesterday with Dr. Not that kind of doctor, clearly, no doctor in that house, Jill Biden. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=166.8s)]
*  And he was asked the question, is it true, President Biden, that you weren't up to performing the job [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=172.32s)]
*  of president? And he couldn't answer the question. So Jill answered it for him. Every day we wake up [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=177.76s)]
*  now. It feels so great to wake up in May of 2025, Sean, to wake up and know that we have a president [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=183.84s)]
*  who can stand and sit and speak all by himself. The border is secure and closed. Peace deals are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=189.28s)]
*  happening. Trade deals are happening. Trillion dollars of investment. People are bringing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=197.12s)]
*  manufacturing back here. The greatest middle-class tax cut is being inked. And prices are down. Even [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=201.12s)]
*  CNBC admitted today. Prices on lettuce, tomato, gas, housing, everything's down. And that's just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=208.32s)]
*  100-watt, 10 days into this administration. Pretty amazing. I'm going to give you the last word, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=213.6s)]
*  Dan. When you look at Federman, as Kellyanne was pointing out, and his treatment, he really only [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=219.68s)]
*  deviates on three issues, the border, Israel, and Iran. I can't think of any other one. And look at [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=226.4s)]
*  how he's been brutalized. What does that tell you about maybe a 2028 primary? If there is a moderate [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=231.44s)]
*  Democrat, I don't think it'd have a shot. Am I wrong? Well, you know, what's interesting, Sean, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=238.32s)]
*  is that in our party, the most progressive candidate has not won the last few presidential [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=243.12s)]
*  primaries. I mean, Bernie Sanders came close twice. But, you know, even Howard Dean wasn't able to do [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=248.96s)]
*  it, you know, years ago. It's going to be interesting. This is a very different party, Kellyanne. I know [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  you agree. This is a very different party than the Howard Dean days. But, Dan, you're welcome to join [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=260.8s)]
*  our party. We're very inclusive. The water is warm. Come on in. Call me. The water is warm. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=268.8s)]
*  Call Kellyanne. Call. All right. Thank you both. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1fj0pxy_NE&t=275.44s)]
