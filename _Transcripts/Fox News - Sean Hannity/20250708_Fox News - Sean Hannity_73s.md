# ‘A NEW LOW?’: Conway slams some Dems for politicizing Texas floods
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I)
*  But first, we turn to something White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt is calling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=0.0s)]
*  depraved and despicable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  For the past 72 hours, as families grieved, Democrats and members of the media have tried [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  to capitalize on the devastating floods in central Texas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=14.68s)]
*  Some blamed Trump's doge cuts for the death toll. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Others cited global warming. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=22.56s)]
*  And at least one far-left monster said that the victims deserved to die and suffer because [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=24.66s)]
*  most Texans voted for Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=31.42s)]
*  The nonstop smear campaign might be a low, a new low for the Democratic Party. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=34.14s)]
*  And per usual, it is completely bogus. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=40.38s)]
*  The National Weather Service did its job. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=44.1s)]
*  There were no staffing shortages. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=46.58s)]
*  This was a horrific tragedy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=48.94s)]
*  And that tragedy should not be exploited for political gain. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=51.059999999999995s)]
*  The White House confirmed today President Trump is set to visit with grieving families [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=55.54s)]
*  in Texas on Friday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vq6iQN0Z8I&t=59.3s)]
