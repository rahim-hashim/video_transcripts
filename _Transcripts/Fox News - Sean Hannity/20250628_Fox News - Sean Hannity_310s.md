# Sean 'Diddy' Combs could be convicted based on this one piece of evidence
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc)
*  In tonight's Other News of the Day segment, closing arguments are now over in the Sean [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=0.0s)]
*  Diddy-Cohm trial. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  The judge will give jury instructions on Monday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=8.24s)]
*  Could Diddy be acquitted? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=11.24s)]
*  Joining us with reaction, Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Greg, why don't we start with that question? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=16.8s)]
*  The Diddy people, the defense didn't put a single witness up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=19.64s)]
*  Could he actually be acquitted? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=22.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=23.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=24.64s)]
*  I long ago gave up trying to predict what jurors are going to do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  And I found out the hard way a couple of times, trying cases myself. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=32.76s)]
*  Look, the prosecution put up a formidable case. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=37.04s)]
*  They had the first word, the last word, Combs' defense in the intervening time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  They basically said for his defense that they failed to prove the case and that our client [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=48.92s)]
*  is a bad guy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  We own the brutal beating of his ex-girlfriend, but nevertheless, everything else was consensual. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  Prosecution said that's utter nonsense. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=68.56s)]
*  They went through methodically all 10 of the underlying crimes that constitute racketeering [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=70.14s)]
*  an ongoing criminal enterprise. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=77.2s)]
*  And they seem to have presented sufficient evidence in the way of witnesses and testimony [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=80.8s)]
*  and other documentary evidence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=86.18s)]
*  If there's one thing that I think will convict Combs, it is that horrific videotape in the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=88.44s)]
*  hallway of a hotel in which he savagely, like a monster, beats his girlfriend. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=94.84s)]
*  I don't know how you get around that if you're a juror. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=102.4s)]
*  And if you're on the fence about reasonable doubt, maybe you say to yourself, this is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  such a bad person, he belongs behind bars. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=111.12s)]
*  I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the government on reasonable doubt. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=115.48s)]
*  That's the thing about when our eyes and our ears are working, whether we see a president [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  in full cognitive decline a year ago on a debate stage or we're watching Sean Combs [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=124.68s)]
*  treat his girlfriend the way you just said. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  And in her majority opinion against nationwide injunctions, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=132.16s)]
*  Barrett blasted her colleague, Katanji Brown Jackson, writing that Jackson is, quote, at [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=137.04s)]
*  odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, and that she, quote, decries [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  an imperial executive while embracing an imperial judiciary. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=147.2s)]
*  Coney Barrett also called out Jackson for being unwilling to, quote, read legalese. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=152.24s)]
*  I mean, Greg, this was a real takedown. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=156.56s)]
*  I don't want people to think it was some kind of partisan catfight. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=160.4s)]
*  I think that Amy Coney Barrett is saying, excuse me, our job in the judiciary, especially [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=162.8s)]
*  the United States Supreme Court, is to interpret the Constitution, to interpret the law. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=167.48s)]
*  So tell us what happened today in this really strongly worded opinion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=172.32s)]
*  Well, I agree with you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=177.36s)]
*  Barrett's stinging rebuke of Jackson's arguments, I think, will go down as historically [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=180.88s)]
*  by saying that her arguments are so incredibly vacuous that they only deserve a quick dismissal. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  And yes, that line, you decry an imperial executive while embracing an imperial judiciary, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  is really the point. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  It's the most penetrating skull that I remember from a justice. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=204.16s)]
*  But it was both true and revealing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=208.06s)]
*  Neither Jackson nor Sotomayor could point to anything in the law that empowers every [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=209.92s)]
*  single unelected judge to hold a president's agenda hostage and freeze the functioning [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=216.32s)]
*  of our government nationwide. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=222.2s)]
*  You know, all 670-plus judges do not have veto power. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  They do not countermand everything the chief executive does that they just don't like [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=228.48s)]
*  personally. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=233.44s)]
*  And Barrett seemed to mock Jackson's inflated claim that this decision marks the downfall [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=234.64s)]
*  of our governing institutions, the degradation of the law. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=241.04s)]
*  That's nonsense. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=245.6s)]
*  It was so far-fetched and overwrought that I think in the end Jackson lost credibility. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=246.6s)]
*  You know, whether it's Sotomayor and one of those decisions last year, I think with [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  respect to migrants, certainly in the leak of the Dobbs case decision three and a half [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=257.3s)]
*  years ago, Greg, and now this, you feel like the Supreme Court is losing its credibility [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=262.66s)]
*  as an institution because some of these justices have conclusions in search of evidence and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=267.22s)]
*  the conclusions feel Trump derangement syndrome addled and a bit political. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=271.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=276.18s)]
*  And look, one of the foremost points that was made today is that the judiciary is an [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=278.06s)]
*  equal branch of government. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=283.98s)]
*  It's not a superior one. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=286.26000000000005s)]
*  Court judges have a narrowly defined role under our constitution and they should not [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=288.46s)]
*  and cannot go beyond that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=294.06s)]
*  Great insights as always, Greg Jarrett. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGZsWa12Yc&t=295.94s)]
