# Alina Habba announces investigation into Democratic governor: 'A WARNING'
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc)
*  Now, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina Haba, is here with more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=0.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=7.12s)]
*  Do you have proof of that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Have you heard that to be true? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=9.44s)]
*  Let me give you a very brief summary of what we do know. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=13.32s)]
*  We know that the governor has on his website currently do's and don'ts for his local [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=16.14s)]
*  state of law enforcement. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=21.64s)]
*  Those do's and don'ts instruct them not to cooperate with illegal immigrants who have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=24.36s)]
*  administrative warrants that have been issued by the court after due process saying that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=29.44s)]
*  they are no longer welcome here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=34.96s)]
*  They have gone through the court system. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=37.28s)]
*  They are to be deported. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=39.08s)]
*  It is instructing them to go against our federal rules, our executive orders. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=40.6s)]
*  And I am, unfortunately, going to announce on your show tonight, Sean, and I want it [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=45.44s)]
*  to be a warning for everybody, that I have instructed my office today to open an investigation [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=49.2s)]
*  into Governor Murphy, to open an investigation into Attorney General Plattkin, who has also [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=53.92s)]
*  instructed the state police not to assist any of our federal, and they list our federal [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=59.36s)]
*  agencies that are under my direction, the FBI, the DEA, all these individuals that are [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=65.4s)]
*  trying to clean up our streets in New Jersey, not to cooperate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=69.8s)]
*  That will no longer stand. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=74.64s)]
*  Pam Bondi has made it clear, and so has our president, that we are to take all criminal, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=75.92s)]
*  violent criminals and criminals out of this country and to completely enforce federal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=81.52s)]
*  law. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=86.4s)]
*  Anybody who does get in that way, in the way of what we are doing, which is not political, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  it is simply against crime, will be charged in the state of New Jersey for obstruction, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  for concealment, and I will come after them hard. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=97.56s)]
*  Including the governor. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=100.2s)]
*  Those investigations will start immediately. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=101.2s)]
*  The governor and the attorney general. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=104.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, Alina, because this is a really important question, because I have felt all [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  during the Biden years, we had wide open borders, known terrorists, murderers, rapists, cartel [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=110.48s)]
*  members, gang members. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  We see all these Americans murdered, raped, victims of violent crime. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=116.74s)]
*  And in my view, both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and I'll add my orchestra to the list, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  they have blood on their hands. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  How is it not aiding and abetting and law breaking if you're a sanctuary city or state, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=128.78s)]
*  or if you are ordering your law enforcement not to cooperate with federal agents when [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=134.62s)]
*  the supremacy clause gives the cloud to the federal government over local officials anyway? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=146.7s)]
*  And let me tell you, to my state officers in New Jersey, some of whom I met with today, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=147.7s)]
*  I appreciate and respect what you can and cannot do. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=152.5s)]
*  They don't have title 8 authority. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=155.34s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=156.62s)]
*  But what they have been instructed to do by the AG and the governor, as is on their website, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=157.74s)]
*  is to actually not even make the phone call to ICE when they run their record and see [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=162.34s)]
*  that there is a valid warrant, an administrative warrant, ordering deportation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=167.02s)]
*  That is putting the people in my state in jeopardy, in a serious predicament. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  And our, frankly, state officers are now being held with their hands behind their back because [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=177.46s)]
*  they have people using politics over crime and the safety of the American people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=182.86s)]
*  Sean, you know how serious I am about law and order. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=187.54000000000002s)]
*  I have been on the other side of it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  I will literally just protect our people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=191.9s)]
*  That is what this is about, American safety. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=195.22s)]
*  And if anybody wants to use politics or their position to go and violate any federal law [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=198.38s)]
*  or any executive order in this state, and that includes sanctuary cities, and I'm looking [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=203.86s)]
*  at you, Patterson, New Jersey, I will be investigating you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  And if you did commit a crime, if you ordered obstruction, if you are ordering concealment [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=211.46s)]
*  and harboring, you will be charged. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=216.18s)]
*  Well, I'm going to give a nice little warning to the AG and the governor. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=218.66s)]
*  If you want to go against Alina Haba, good luck, because she has a lot of Trump in her, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=224.22s)]
*  and you're messing with the wrong person here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=231.5s)]
*  Alina, thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  Keep up the good work. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guD2hfPVHdc&t=235.57999999999998s)]
