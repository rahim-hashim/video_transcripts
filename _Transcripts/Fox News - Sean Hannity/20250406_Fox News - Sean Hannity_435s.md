# Dr. Oz offers ‘big ideas’ for tackling some of America’s biggest health ‘challenges’
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA)
*  All right, yesterday in a 53-45 vote, the Senate in fact confirmed Dr. Mehmet Oz to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=0.0s)]
*  lead the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=6.3s)]
*  So how does he plan on rooting out the waste, the fraud, the abuse, the corruption? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=9.86s)]
*  He joins us now, his very first exclusive interview since being confirmed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=14.6s)]
*  First of all, you're a personal friend of mine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  You're the right person for this job. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  I'm so happy you got confirmed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=23.6s)]
*  You know, I know that you're idiots or idiots, but you know, that was to be expected in the process. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=26.06s)]
*  Why you gave up 500 businesses to do this, I don't know, but I'm grateful that you did. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=30.06s)]
*  Can we clarify one thing first? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=36.14s)]
*  Can you just get it out of the way? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=38.42s)]
*  The president has said it to me, the vice president has said it to me, others have said [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=40.4s)]
*  it over and over. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=45.84s)]
*  The president has no plans to make any cuts to Social Security or Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  not all ever, end of sentence. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=53.7s)]
*  The president has said he will love and cherish Medicare, exactly what he's going to do. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=57.2s)]
*  I do want to thank the president for having the confidence in me to appoint me to this [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=61.86s)]
*  job of a lifetime. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=65.64s)]
*  It is something I feel like I've been training for my whole career, practicing medicine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=66.64s)]
*  I went to business school actually, so I learned to manage large groups. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=71.06s)]
*  On the show we talked about so many of the pillars of the Baja movement, and Bobby Kennedy, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  has had the ability to push forward strongly on these issues as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=80.28s)]
*  But the president knows something that's very, very important. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=83.98s)]
*  All great societies, all of them, take care of their most vulnerable, and we're great [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=87.18s)]
*  people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=92.34s)]
*  So we're going to make sure that the young, the old, the disabled, the folks that are [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=93.4s)]
*  having trouble and need a hand up, we're going to make sure they're there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=97.1s)]
*  We need to be supportive of them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=101.22s)]
*  We're going to be able to get them back on their feet and get them to be part of the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=103.0s)]
*  American dream, which is what the president is crafting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  I've got to tell you, Sean, as a close friend, you know I tell the truth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=109.16s)]
*  Doctors are trained to give the story straight up. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  We've got some challenges, which is why the CMS programs are so important. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=115.64s)]
*  The health insurance of our country is challenged by the fact that Medicaid is the number one [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  budget item for most states. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=124.14s)]
*  It's challenged by the fact that our health economy, the amount of money we're spending [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=126.46s)]
*  on health care is growing two times faster than the rest of the economy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=129.72s)]
*  In fact, we're paying twice as much per American to get health care than any other country [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=133.32s)]
*  on the planet. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=138.2s)]
*  And despite that, our life expectancy has dropped. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=139.2s)]
*  We're about five years shorter in life expectancy than our competing countries in Europe and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  the rest of the world. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  So, with all this going on, there's a lot of things we've got to do to make a difference, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  and that's why I was honored to take this position. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  All right, so we got that out of the way. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=155.7s)]
*  Can we bring in innovative ways, new ways of thinking? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=158.54s)]
*  For example, I know AtlasMD was created out of Wichita, Kansas. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=161.73999999999998s)]
*  Access to a doctor anytime 24-7, 365. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  And telemedicine is a big part of their practice. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=173.96s)]
*  If you're sick in the middle of the night, you get on a Zoom call with a doctor and probably [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  get prescribed whatever you need to be there in the morning, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=181.76s)]
*  Or how do we drive down the high cost of prescription drugs for people? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=185.56s)]
*  How do we do that? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=191.4s)]
*  What are some of the strategies you think you can employ to save money and eliminate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=192.64s)]
*  waste, fraud and abuse? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=196.44s)]
*  Our country is too great for small ideas, so let me give you some big ideas, because [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=198.74s)]
*  you just touched on something really important. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=202.62s)]
*  We have to empower beneficiaries, empower the American people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=204.4s)]
*  We're smart people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=208.9s)]
*  You give us the information. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=209.9s)]
*  Tell me what I need to do to get healthier today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=211.14s)]
*  Help me understand what requires me to see a doctor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=213.54s)]
*  Help me find the right doctor. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=215.5s)]
*  Make the appointment for me, and then tell me what it's going to cost, both when I see [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=217.24s)]
*  the doc but also the treatments that I might get prescribed or offered during that visit. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=220.46s)]
*  All this, by the way, the president and his executive order empowered Americans by insisting [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=225.16s)]
*  that we do that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=229.6s)]
*  It's one of the things that makes the American people number one in the game plan that we [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=230.92s)]
*  have at CMS. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  I also want to point out we've got to take care of the doctors. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  We have a mojo problem amongst the medical community. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=239.04s)]
*  Many physicians and nurses and practitioners feel left out of the story. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=241.44s)]
*  Let's empower physicians and health care providers with information at their fingertips so they [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=245.24s)]
*  can provide better advice to you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=250.42s)]
*  Why let them have to figure everything out when we can actually pull together [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=252.48s)]
*  information and provide it to clinicians so when they're making decisions about your [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=255.08s)]
*  well-being, they can tell you exactly what they're doing and then share that information [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=259.58000000000004s)]
*  and why they're making it with you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=263.42s)]
*  But most importantly, Sean, these tactics by modernizing American medicine will allow [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=265.18s)]
*  us to deal with the waste, fraud, and abuse that you alluded to earlier. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=269.82s)]
*  And let me give you some numbers that are going to keep you up tonight. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=273.1s)]
*  First off, I just a couple right off the ... this is right out of the oven, these ideas. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=275.66s)]
*  And it's remarkable how many of these problems have persisted for years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=280.86s)]
*  This year, we had 230,000 Americans who were on the Affordable Care Act, the Obamacare [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  plans, who didn't know it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=290.24s)]
*  They found out when the IRS agents called up and said, you know, you guys have this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=292.0s)]
*  free program in your family. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  Did you know you have it? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=296.84s)]
*  Brokers had given them these programs, made money off the U.S. government. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=298.4s)]
*  They had no idea it had happened. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  The state of California has taken tens of millions of dollars from the federal government [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=303.0s)]
*  providing free health insurance for illegal immigrants in California. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=307.4s)]
*  We're going to get that money back. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=312.28s)]
*  There are programs like this that we're witnessing day in and day out where Medicaid patients [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  are enrolled in multiple states and the federal government doesn't know about it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=317.7s)]
*  We pay every state for the same person and we're not getting our money's worth, but [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=321.41999999999996s)]
*  those people aren't getting their health either. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=325.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=327.17999999999995s)]
*  One of the things, when I spoke with Bobby Kennedy, and he pointed out to me, and actually [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=328.17999999999995s)]
*  I spoke to you about it as well, the fact that Europe won't buy or take in our meat [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  or take in our produce, that tells me there's a reason. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=342.96s)]
*  What is the reason? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=347.88s)]
*  And if they're not doing it for health reasons, should we change how we grow things, how our [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=349.4s)]
*  ranchers raise their cattle, et cetera? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=355.4s)]
*  You know, Sean, you can sprinkle the medication on kielbasa, but eating the kielbasa is still [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=360.34s)]
*  going to make you sick. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=364.44s)]
*  And in America, we actually do things to... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=365.88s)]
*  I like kielbasa. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  I do too. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  And with your heart, it probably is not the best thing to put on your platter. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=371.18s)]
*  We make a lot of foods that are, on the surface, healthy, but we've adulterated them. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=373.74s)]
*  We've put products into them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=378.74s)]
*  We've mixed up how your biology deals with the complexity of the chemistry that they [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=380.22s)]
*  put in these foods so you don't actually understand how to metabolize them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons I believe that this country is getting overweight and getting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=388.22s)]
*  depressed and feeling out of sorts. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=392.22s)]
*  The Europeans are not willing to take the chance. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=394.54s)]
*  They block us from exporting products from this country to their country because they [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=396.98s)]
*  don't want their people eating those products. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54zEiBbAWZA&t=400.18s)]
