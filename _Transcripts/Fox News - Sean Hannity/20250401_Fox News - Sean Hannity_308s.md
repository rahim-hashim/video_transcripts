# Stephen Miller: Trump is resetting the entire global market
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I)
*  House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller is with us. Stephen, good to see you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=0.0s)]
*  The amount of money and investment just over the threat of these tariffs, the amount of change [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=5.92s)]
*  has taken place from Europe to India to Canada to Mexico, elsewhere around the world is deep, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=12.72s)]
*  it is profound. By my math, we're approaching $4 trillion of money that otherwise likely would [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  never have been invested in manufacturing in this country had the president not done this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=26.319999999999997s)]
*  Yes, this is the great healing and rejuvenation of the American economy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  after half a century of rampant offshoring, outsourcing and deindustrialization. Sean, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=39.76s)]
*  there was once a time in which Motor City in Michigan, Detroit automakers powered the entire [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  globe. There was once a time when you could drive through Pennsylvania and all you would see [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=53.2s)]
*  were humming steel mills, humming coal plants, manufacturing facilities, again, that were [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=57.92s)]
*  supplying the entire world, supplying Americans and all the planet Earth. Ohio was again a bedrock [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  of American industry in manufacturing. Foreign countries, countries like China, Canada, Mexico, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=71.28s)]
*  Cambodia, Vietnam and the European Union took advantage of our country and our leaders, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=78.64s)]
*  and they use both high tariffs, illegal subsidies, product dumping, currency manipulation, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=84.72s)]
*  intellectual property theft and other unfair trade practices and predatory trade practices [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=92.16s)]
*  to crush American industry. President Trump is resetting the entire global market by saying, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=98.0s)]
*  number one, you can't steal our jobs. Number two, if you want to get preferential treatment, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=105.84s)]
*  you have to put your factory inside the United States, your auto plant, your manufacturing, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  your facility, your AI plant, your chip plant, whatever it is. You want to sell it to Americans [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=118.08s)]
*  on a preferential basis, then you have to make it here. And if you do, you'll get low taxes, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  low regulations and cheap energy. But if you sell it to us from overseas, then yes, you will pay a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=129.04s)]
*  tariff. You know, okay, so Canada, for example, they don't pay their fair share of NATO. They [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=134.96s)]
*  don't control their borders and they have all these tariffs on products that are impactful to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  the American manufacturers, American dairy, American poultry. So they put all these tariffs, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=150.32s)]
*  even going up to 245 percent after a certain level, which is madness to me. If you buy a car [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=156.16s)]
*  in Germany, you pay a 10 percent tariff and then you pay a VAT tax, which is a value added tax [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=162.08s)]
*  on top of that, which means that Germany sells eight cars in America for every one car sold, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  American car sold in Germany. Why should we put up with that? I thought they're supposed to be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=174.08s)]
*  our friends and allies. Isn't it amazing, Sean? Think about this. The American defense umbrella [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=178.4s)]
*  paid for by American taxpayers single handedly keeps Canada safe and Europe safe and NATO safe. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=187.68s)]
*  It's all us, Sean. Without us, these countries have no security net whatsoever. And instead of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=195.68s)]
*  paying for their own defense, what do they do with our largesse? They use the money they've saved [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=202.72s)]
*  to expand the social safety net for our citizens. Then it gets worse. Then they use price controls [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=208.4s)]
*  to artificially lower the price of drugs that they import, forcing Americans to pay higher [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=214.48s)]
*  prices. They abuse our auto companies. They abuse our manufacturing. And they set unfair trade [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=220.32s)]
*  policies to keep our industries out of their countries while we keep them free, while we [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  protect them from adversaries around the world. And Canada, for example, they charge what roughly [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=231.2s)]
*  amounts to a 15 percent VAT. We're supposed to be in a free trade deal with Canada. Why are they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=236.56s)]
*  putting a VAT on every product that we send to Canada? Why are they locking out American [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=240.88s)]
*  agricultural products from their market with outrageously high tariffs? Why are they imposing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=245.84s)]
*  a digital service tax on our tech industry? Why are they manipulating the supply chains [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=250.88s)]
*  to prevent American auto manufacturing facilities from being in the United States of America? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=257.84s)]
*  So again, these countries that we are defending, that we are protecting, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=263.36s)]
*  are taking advantage of us in every conceivable way. And Donald Trump is saying all those empty [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=267.68s)]
*  factories all across the United States, you know, when you drive through the Rust Belt, you see them, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  all these hollowed out factories, we're going to bring them humming back to life by having low [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=276.96s)]
*  taxes here, by having tariffs on countries that take advantage of us, and by stopping the theft of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  American products from all of our competitors around the world. All right, Stephen Miller, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=288.56s)]
*  as always, very articulate. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rl-qaJRN8I&t=294.08s)]
