# Trump 2.0 has been winning since day one, Hannity argues
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E)
*  Welcome to the special Friday night edition of Hannity. A hundred days of political shock [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=0.0s)]
*  and awe driving the left crazy. Now, amid a flurry of activity on every front, Donald [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=6.28s)]
*  Trump's second term has been filled with wins from day one, all while the president's political [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=11.36s)]
*  rivals, they're looking clueless, very angry, unhinged and quite defeated. Now, just today [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=16.7s)]
*  after weeks of doom and gloom about the economy from the legacy media mob, job growth, shattered [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=22.44s)]
*  all expectations. Now, this is the second month in a row that the jobs report outpaced economic [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=28.04s)]
*  forecast. Keep in mind, these are all private sector gains. The size of government has been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=34.32s)]
*  shrinking under Trump, yet the labor participation rate is up. Wages are up. Costs are down. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=40.24s)]
*  Gas and energy prices are at their lowest point in years. And now, according to Gallup, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=46.96s)]
*  fewer Americans are worried about inflation. The doom, the gloom, prediction surrounding [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=51.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's trade negotiations, they were all bogus. We'll show you that in polls in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=56.88s)]
*  just a moment. But just this week, even China quietly eliminated tariffs on certain American [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  products. Oh, wow. He challenged China and hopefully they'll come to a deal as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=69.2s)]
*  And new tonight, President Xi is open to direct talks with Donald Trump and the White House [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=75.4s)]
*  to lower tariffs across the board. Once again, the end of days hysteria on the left, totally [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=80.8s)]
*  unwarranted. And as an added bonus, by the way, tonight, there is another big win for [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=87.88s)]
*  Trump that will drive Democrats crazy. That makes me happy. Late last night, the president [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=92.64s)]
*  signed an executive order to strip all federal funding from NPR and PBS. Of course, these [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  far left outlets, they can continue to function just without your money. President Trump is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=104.2s)]
*  also now threatening to remove the tax exempt status from Harvard for failing to comply [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=109.34s)]
*  with basic civil rights amid rampant racial and religious discrimination on campus. This [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=114.9s)]
*  brings us to another bogus smear campaign from the left. According to Democrats, there [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=120.7s)]
*  is deep regret among Trump voters. But for some reason, the state run legacy media mob [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=125.78s)]
*  just can't seem to find anyone in real life who actually regrets their vote. Look for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=131.82s)]
*  yourself. If you had to do it all over again, would you vote for Donald Trump again? Yes [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=136.98s)]
*  or no? Yes, I would. Now, in the future, I am not a diehard Democrat or diehard Republican. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  If there were a Democratic candidate who was more aligned for me, then I would vote [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=151.22s)]
*  Democrat. If you go back in time, would you vote for Donald Trump? Yes or no? Yes. I think [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=157.98s)]
*  I might know the answer on this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=162.33999999999997s)]
*  It's immediately yes. No, I'm sorry. If you had to do it all over again, would you vote for Donald [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=167.61999999999998s)]
*  Trump? Yes or no? 1000%. Absolutely yes. Even fake news CNN this week said, yeah, the polling [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=173.38s)]
*  shows Donald Trump would win easily again. Anyway, Americans do not regret voting for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  Trump, the legacy media mob, and trying to push that narrative for a week. Why? Because [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=186.82s)]
*  he's doing what he promised to do, securing the border, deporting illegal immigrants, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=192.62s)]
*  bringing down prices, holding government bureaucrats accountable, negotiating better, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=196.66000000000003s)]
*  freer, fairer trade deals, and eliminating waste, fraud, abuse, corruption. This agenda [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  is only controversial among the radical left. That would be the entire Democratic Party. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=206.98000000000002s)]
*  And now after getting blown out in 2024, Democrats are just doubling down on their extreme [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=212.5s)]
*  positions. Just listen to who Kamala Harris decided to praise during her late night rant. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=218.9s)]
*  Take a look. Leaders across the spectrum, including congressional leaders like Cory Booker, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=225.06s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Cross, AOC and Bernie Sanders. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=232.66s)]
*  All who in different ways have been speaking with moral clarity about this moment. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=241.3s)]
*  Okay. What a great list of people to choose from for 2028. I guess that's their shortlist. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=257.62s)]
*  Make it right there, mark it down, and we'll see what happens over time. The only problem is they're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=263.78s)]
*  all radical leftist extremists. Make no mistake, the people Kamala mentioned here, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=268.58s)]
*  they are the real leaders of the Democratic Party. That part she got right. By the way, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=274.34s)]
*  did she tell you the story about the elephant? I digress. In fact, congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=278.41999999999996s)]
*  who is now the second most influential Democratic congresswoman behind AOC, reportedly now telling [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=283.14s)]
*  her colleagues she is quote, made for the moment. And she now wants to lead the all powerful House [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  Oversight Committee. Keep in mind, this is the same Jasmine Crockett who thinks deporting [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=295.78s)]
*  illegal immigrants is kidnapping. I didn't make that one up. Take a look. As far as I'm concerned, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=300.97999999999996s)]
*  you randomly kidnapping folk and you throwing them out of the country against their civil rights, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=307.05999999999995s)]
*  against their constitutional rights. And frankly, how would they feel if some other country decided [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=311.78s)]
*  that they were going to start throwing people randomly in our country? Like that, that is [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  absolutely insane. So yes, all I got to say is y'all need to get these fools out of here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=321.46s)]
*  Now, this is the very same congresswoman who still to this day thinks that Joe Biden is sharp as [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=329.06s)]
*  attack. Listen, I'm gonna tell you this. You know, people tried to talk about the mental acuity of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=334.82s)]
*  Joe Biden. And as someone who was able to interact with him, I never questioned his mental acuity. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=343.14s)]
*  Now, the delusion among the leading Democratic parties, almost hard to believe. Why can't they [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  just be honest with the American people? I don't know. That would be refreshing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kI8iGRlc8E&t=354.97999999999996s)]
