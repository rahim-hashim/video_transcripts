# Lindsey Graham details plan to get Trump's agenda through the Senate
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk)
*  With more with his brand new plan to get Trump's agenda through the Senate, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=0.0s)]
*  All right. So for the president's for the president to get [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=5.68s)]
*  his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=10.4s)]
*  economic plan in place putting the tariff issue completely aside and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=11.42s)]
*  That would be making the tax cuts permanent. No tax on tips. No tax on Social Security [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=16.2s)]
*  No tax on overtime [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=21.92s)]
*  To get more money for the border and border security and to deport people [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=24.0s)]
*  To get more money and get our energy sector up and running at the level we need [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=28.64s)]
*  historically that would take reconciliation and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=34.52s)]
*  Usually you would need 60 votes to get that passed. However, yeah [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=37.56s)]
*  The Democrats have set a precedent not once not twice not three times [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=41.88s)]
*  But four times and that is the chairman of the Budget Committee which happens to be you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=45.92s)]
*  You don't need permission from the Senate parliamentarian and you will bypass the process [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=52.32s)]
*  Sounds complicated. It's not tell us where we are with this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=58.48s)]
*  Okay, number one. No Democrat is going to help us cut your taxes secure your border [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=62.88s)]
*  Give additional money to the military [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=69.52s)]
*  They're not going to do any of that stuff. We are [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=72.6s)]
*  We've had the House the Senate and the White House [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=76.84s)]
*  Republicans four times in the last hundred years when you have all three you can do things through budget [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=80.94s)]
*  Reconciliation in the Senate to avoid the 60 vote requirement the Democrats did Obamacare through reconciliation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=88.78s)]
*  and the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=96.78s)]
*  the infrastructure bill through reconciliation [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=98.42s)]
*  Not using any not counting on us. We have a historic opportunity [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=101.1s)]
*  To make the tax cuts permanent to fully fund the border plan for four years without one Democratic vote [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=106.74s)]
*  Help the military and cut trillions of spending without one Democratic vote being needed if we can work together [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  Today 52 48 we move forward [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=121.22s)]
*  We'll be voting tomorrow night probably in the middle of the night to set in motion [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=124.3s)]
*  the four things President Trump promised make the tax cuts permanent as [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=128.94s)]
*  Budget chairman I decided to make a decision [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=133.94s)]
*  That's within my authority to use current policy making tax cutting the same as spending under the budget [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=137.06s)]
*  Control act means that you don't have to play this game that they expire. We're gonna keep them in place [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  Which will be great for the economy a hundred and seventy five billion dollars for the border patrol to finish the wall more beds [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=149.22s)]
*  To see you don't have to release people and more ice agents [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=156.66s)]
*  150 billion for the military and we're gonna cut trillions of dollars of spending when we get the reconciliation bill [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=160.16s)]
*  This jump starts the process and John Thune delivered our [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=166.84s)]
*  Republican senators delivered working with Mike Johnson and President Trump [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=171.88s)]
*  We're going to deliver for you at home like we promised [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=176.88s)]
*  Okay, four times in a hundred years Republicans or White House the house and the Senate [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  So this is a rare moment of a window of opportunity [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=186.56s)]
*  To make these tax cuts permanent you are going to exercise the authority that the Democrats [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  Exercise to pass Obamacare and the inflation reduction act. Is that correct and Democrats are screaming bloody murder [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=197.52s)]
*  Yeah, Democrats have adjusted the baseline to accommodate their spending needs. I am I as a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=204.56s)]
*  Budget chairman can set the baseline for taxes. I am going to say through my [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=212.64s)]
*  Distression as budget chairman that the baseline for taxes will be current policy, which means they will not expire [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  They never add to the deficit by the way when you cut taxes, you always get more revenue [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=227.04s)]
*  You just spend more money [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to do something that I have the authority to do that should have been a long done a long time ago [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=233.32s)]
*  I'm gonna make the Trump tax cuts permanent. That's a big friggin deal [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  We're going to give a hundred seventy five billion dollars of the border patrol to do what Trump promised without needing one Democratic vote [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=243.17999999999998s)]
*  We're gonna help the military and we're gonna cut spending and all that will start in about two weeks if we pass the bill tomorrow night [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  All right, when you say in the middle of the night what you really mean literally in the middle of the night [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=257.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we're gonna work our ass off [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=264.38s)]
*  Faire is not an option senator Thune is put in place along with me and all of my colleagues a process [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=267.78s)]
*  To jumpstart what I just described we will have to say this called the Voter Rama [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=275.12s)]
*  We could be there to three or four in the morning, but we're not gonna quit [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=281.34s)]
*  Well, this may I thought Cavanaugh you have maybe one of your best moments as a senator [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  This is probably the most important thing you can do for the future of our country to get this economy in place and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=292.58s)]
*  We need all 53 senators. Hopefully to get on board. Are you confident? You will have the votes to get this done last question [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=300.1s)]
*  Yes, I do. I do believe it. This is President Trump's agenda. We have a chance to make it make it [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=308.22s)]
*  Contact their senators [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=315.06s)]
*  on radio tomorrow [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=317.14s)]
*  I'll let you know but we promised to cut your taxes. We've promised a security border [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=319.5s)]
*  We've promised to make the military stronger and we promised to cut spending [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=324.62s)]
*  We're gonna do it without Democrats if we all act together [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  I am confident we will get there and God help us if we don't [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PqUuAlK1fk&t=331.65999999999997s)]
