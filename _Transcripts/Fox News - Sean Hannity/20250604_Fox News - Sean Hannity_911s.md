# BREAKING: Bongino reveals SHOCKING info on Epstein video
**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE)
*  All right, we continue now with FBI Deputy Director Dan Mangino. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=0.0s)]
*  Dan, sorry about that technical error. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=4.4s)]
*  All right, I was asking you, you mentioned the drone threat. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=6.12s)]
*  You mentioned China. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=9.32s)]
*  I mentioned we have known terrorists, known assassination squads, cartel members, gang [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=10.52s)]
*  members, drug dealers in the country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=15.16s)]
*  So it's worse than you thought, is what you're explaining to us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  And that means you have to prioritize your manpower, including a million man hours spent [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=21.44s)]
*  on immigration and finding these unvetted illegals that have these horrific track records. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=26.32s)]
*  Let me scroll, for example. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=33.32s)]
*  I scrolled this during the campaign. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=35.2s)]
*  Americans that were murdered, raped and victims of violent crime, no Democrat ever cared. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=37.32s)]
*  They told us the border was secure and the border was closed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=43.08s)]
*  I'll scroll the names. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=46.64s)]
*  Explain how you prioritize that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=47.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's manpower triage has become, Cash and I, our number one job. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=50.559999999999995s)]
*  The FBI portfolio responsibilities, Sean, hasn't changed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=56.92s)]
*  The counterterror mission, in other words, we can't have New York, D.C. or L.A. go [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=60.32s)]
*  boom, obviously. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=64.92s)]
*  We wake up every day, Cash and I, in that briefing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=66.16s)]
*  That's always going to be priority number one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=69.32s)]
*  But kind of co-equal priorities right now underneath that, the massive cyber threat, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=71.68s)]
*  the counterintelligence threat, you just accurately indicated. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=76.24s)]
*  The number of people that were, that flooded in through the southern border and some through [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  the northern border as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=84.48s)]
*  There are people here, let's be very clear, who want to do bad things. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=86.52s)]
*  I think that's fairly obvious. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=90.68s)]
*  We have our FBI teams out there at 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=92.68s)]
*  They can tell you, and they're happy to do it, out there working with HSI, ERO and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=96.64s)]
*  removing these people from the country while still preventing a terror attack, investigating [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=102.08s)]
*  terror attacks that do happen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to add another thing, Sean. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=109.88s)]
*  We're not the Federal Bureau of freaking word games anymore, OK? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  It's the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=115.72s)]
*  When some guy shows up at a scene and I'm getting an intel stream from our information [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=118.24s)]
*  center that indicates he threw an incendiary device, OK, while screaming very specific [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=124.72s)]
*  words with multiple witnesses and video, we're damn well going to investigate it, listen [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=130.88s)]
*  to me, investigate it as targeted violence and a terror attack. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=137.08s)]
*  You don't like it, you don't have to follow my official Twitter, but I saw a whole bunch [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  of people losing their minds. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  What the hell you want us to investigate it as? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=146.84s)]
*  A freaking grand larceny auto? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=148.96s)]
*  We're investigating it as a terror attack because that's the information we have. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=151.52s)]
*  And we're not going to start playing euphemisms games and word games anymore. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=157.0s)]
*  We're not doing it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  We're going to go to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and we're going to investigate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=162.6s)]
*  properly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=165.48s)]
*  For those, and it's kind of a lightning round because we're just, I don't have enough time, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=166.48s)]
*  unless I gave you the whole hour and it would be worth doing it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=171.24s)]
*  But for people like me, I'm one of them, I want answers to the Epstein file issue and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=174.28s)]
*  what happened. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=179.24s)]
*  And I never knew there were 10,000 hours of tapes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=180.24s)]
*  And was it suicide? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=183.9s)]
*  You said there's a tape or JFK, RFK, MLK files. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  All of that is still coming, correct? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=189.6s)]
*  Yeah, JFK, we're done. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  The FBI's equities and that, we've already released that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=194.24s)]
*  RFK, I've got to check back on that one. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=197.12s)]
*  There is more coming on the Epstein files. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=200.72s)]
*  Listen, I know this is a hot potato for folks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=203.12s)]
*  I totally understand. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=205.8s)]
*  My comments were clear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=207.52s)]
*  I'm not paid for my opinions anymore. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=208.52s)]
*  I work for the taxpayer now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=210.08s)]
*  I'm paid on evidence. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=211.56s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=212.84s)]
*  The evidence we have in our files clearly indicates that it was in fact a suicide. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=213.84s)]
*  We do have video. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=219.52s)]
*  It's not the greatest video in the world. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=220.56s)]
*  I don't want to set expectations on fire. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=222.16s)]
*  However, the video does show in that specific block that he goes in, made a phone call. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=224.36s)]
*  You'll see 12 hours of guards going in, basically check on them, come back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=229.96s)]
*  You'll see no one really comes out in that bay, in that area, than him. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=234.96s)]
*  There's no one in there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=238.52s)]
*  When you combine that with the other evidence where we will be releasing in the coming weeks, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=240.12s)]
*  we're still finalizing some of the products, I think it's pretty clear. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=244.88s)]
*  However, as I've clearly indicated in some of my tweets on my official account, you know, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=249.04s)]
*  listen, investigations, if new information services in the future on any of these cases, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=254.4s)]
*  we're always open. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=259.44s)]
*  I'm just telling you there's nothing there in the file at all that indicates anything [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=260.44s)]
*  other than in fact a suicide. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=264.28s)]
*  Let me ask you about, and again, a lightning round. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=266.88s)]
*  Let's go quickly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=269.12s)]
*  COVID origins. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=270.12s)]
*  Are we going to find out information that the government lied to us? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=271.12s)]
*  You're damn right you are. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=274.2s)]
*  We're all over that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=276.48s)]
*  The minute I got in there in that job, I said, get everybody in here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  They purposely lied to the American people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  They purposely lied to us. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=283.12s)]
*  Oh, you're going to find out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=284.12s)]
*  Yeah, listen, that's the one I'm the most optimistic about. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=285.12s)]
*  I was pretty clear on my social media account that I ordered that case immediately to be [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=287.8s)]
*  looked into again. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=294.16s)]
*  We have a great investigator on it, and I think we should see action on that one shortly. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=295.8s)]
*  Let me ask you about this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=302.0s)]
*  The prior FBI director, or directors, let's say, you know, we saw a double standard when [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  it came to the Mar-a-Lago raid and top secret and classified information, Donald Trump versus [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=316.36s)]
*  Did you see any evidence, has any evidence emerged that former directors may have tried [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=320.88000000000005s)]
*  to cover their tracks? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  And you did mention the other day that maybe traps were being set for you and cash? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=328.56s)]
*  Well, I'll address to you, you addressed the Mar-a-Lago raid. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=334.16s)]
*  Action was taken on that because it involves human resources issues. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=337.96s)]
*  I can't make specific comments, but anyone telling you we did an action that is lying [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=341.0s)]
*  to you, absolutely lying to you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=345.56s)]
*  I assure you, we did. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=347.76s)]
*  Was it political, in other words? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=349.76s)]
*  Was that a political decision? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=351.88s)]
*  Sean, because it involves some specific HR actions, we had to take, I don't want to get [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=354.08s)]
*  into specifics on that, but we found, I'll leave it at this. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=359.6s)]
*  We found some troubling, really troubling items in there that we actioned immediately, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=362.76s)]
*  to say the least. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  Also, what was the— [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  Is it fair to say that a double standard was applied in that case in terms of top secret [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=370.56s)]
*  classified information? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=374.8s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=375.84s)]
*  Well, I think that's fairly clear when you look at how two cases were handled there. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=377.32s)]
*  And that's why we did a scrub immediately of holdings. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=384.76s)]
*  And like I said, we had to take action on that immediately. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=390.16s)]
*  And it was another case—you brought up another case. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=392.88000000000005s)]
*  I went, oh, you brought up the other directors. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=394.56s)]
*  Comey, as a matter of fact, the guy who has a lot to say, ironically, about me and Cash, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=396.68s)]
*  and that's fine. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=402.04s)]
*  You know, that's—he's allowed an opinion. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=403.04s)]
*  He is a free American citizen, like anyone else. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=405.08000000000004s)]
*  But we found items. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=408.44000000000005s)]
*  I addressed this on Fox and Friends, and I can go into a little bit more detail. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=410.12s)]
*  But we found things. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=413.8s)]
*  We found documents. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  That were not where they should have been. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=417.68s)]
*  And they were not good, flattering documents for Jim Comey. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  So the hubris displayed from a man like Jim Comey, who disgraced the FBI numerous times [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=423.32s)]
*  with his role in Crossfire Hurricane and other abominations, it's just kind of stunning [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=429.96s)]
*  that he continues to attack our leadership when we have to clean up the mess Jim Comey [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=435.8s)]
*  created as we continue to find stuff from his era and vintage. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=442.52s)]
*  Well, he signed three of the four FISA warrants that were all based—the bulk of information [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=447.32s)]
*  presented to the FISA court was the dirty Russian disinformation dossier that Hillary [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=452.68s)]
*  Clinton paid for. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=457.2s)]
*  Between that and the origins of Crossfire Hurricane, are you finding evidence that they [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=459.34000000000003s)]
*  knew damn well that that was false and that they did it for political reason, that in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=464.72s)]
*  fact the FBI, what was supposed—what is supposed to be the world's premier law enforcement [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=469.24s)]
*  agency was politicized and weaponized? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=474.12s)]
*  I think of all the troubling things I've seen so far on the reform agenda, the Crossfire [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=477.4s)]
*  Hurricane documents and what we found are those. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=482.72s)]
*  Now, again, I've seen some commentary, because I enjoy the feedback. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=485.4s)]
*  I do. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=490.4s)]
*  I like it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=491.4s)]
*  And people are wondering, where are the documents? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=492.4s)]
*  Well, the documents are coming out. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=493.4s)]
*  The problem with the documents coming out—and Director Patel has said this multiple times—it [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=495.24s)]
*  is a rolling production of Crossfire Hurricane documents. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=499.64s)]
*  Well, you may ask, fair enough, why the hell is it rolling? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=502.64s)]
*  Why don't you get it all out? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=505.8s)]
*  Because we don't have it all. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=506.8s)]
*  Well, why don't you have it all? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=508.12s)]
*  Because nobody gave it to us all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, why didn't they do that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=511.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=513.64s)]
*  We're finding stuff. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=514.64s)]
*  We have a lot of good people working on it, I promise you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=515.64s)]
*  But the bad people kind of knew what they were doing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=518.12s)]
*  So the rolling production is rolling for a reason. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=521.16s)]
*  As soon as we find this stuff and other—remember, other intelligence agencies have some equities [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=524.3s)]
*  in it too, and we can clear that through the process, we're getting it out. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=529.0s)]
*  Congress and the U.S. Senate that have reached out, we're getting them the stuff as soon [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=533.0799999999999s)]
*  as it comes in. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=536.76s)]
*  And yes, one of the specific documents I read indicates to me that there was a large degree [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=537.76s)]
*  of malfeasance here. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  We're not just talking misfeasance. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=546.64s)]
*  Let me ask you about—you're going to be looking into, Cash and Pam, any potential [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=549.4s)]
*  collusion between the DOJ, Letitia James, the novel legal theory of Alvin Bragg or Nathan [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=555.0s)]
*  Wade or Fonny Willis and the DOJ. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=562.88s)]
*  Is that something? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  Has anything come up? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=568.04s)]
*  Is there any way to determine whether or not evidence was destroyed in any of these cases? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=569.64s)]
*  Well, there's always a way to determine that. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=575.0s)]
*  I don't want to comment on that specific case right now for a reason. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=578.04s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of the Department of Justice on that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  But I want to say this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=585.5s)]
*  The FBI obviously has the public corruption portfolio. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=586.88s)]
*  And yes, if you are a corrupt politician out there, if you are engaged in behavior, you [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  know what you're doing, we're going to find you, I promise. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=597.6800000000001s)]
*  No one is going to get off the days of selecting and putting your partisan bias on and taking [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=601.52s)]
*  care of your friends. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=607.32s)]
*  Those days are over. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=608.6s)]
*  You know what, Sean? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=609.6s)]
*  I don't have any friends. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=610.6s)]
*  I don't want any friends. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=611.6s)]
*  Well, maybe outside of you. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=612.6s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=613.6s)]
*  You're stuck with me. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=614.6s)]
*  I didn't come here for the money. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=615.6s)]
*  I didn't come here to make—I know. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=616.6s)]
*  I love it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=617.6s)]
*  No, you didn't come here for the money. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=618.6s)]
*  I can tell people that for sure. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=619.6s)]
*  I can tell people that for sure. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=620.96s)]
*  I can tell people that for sure. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=621.96s)]
*  I don't care about friends. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=622.96s)]
*  I don't have any friends. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=623.96s)]
*  I don't want any friends. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=624.96s)]
*  I got my wife, I got you, and I got a small crew of people. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=625.96s)]
*  So I don't need any friends. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=627.2s)]
*  But if you're a politician, screw it around. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=628.48s)]
*  If you want a friend in D.C., get a dog. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=629.48s)]
*  We're coming for you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=630.48s)]
*  That'll help. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=631.48s)]
*  Yeah, go. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=632.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=633.48s)]
*  You want a friend in D.C.? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=634.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=635.48s)]
*  Go get a Labrador like I have. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=636.48s)]
*  Get a dog. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=637.48s)]
*  Because there are no friends in D.C. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=638.48s)]
*  You've been doing this for what, 30 years? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=639.48s)]
*  There are no friends here. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=640.48s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=642.28s)]
*  I mean, Dan, I mean, we covered this extensively when you were in the media, you covered it [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=644.52s)]
*  extensively. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  All seem on the surface to be extreme abuses of power. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=661.72s)]
*  Is this something we will get answers to? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=666.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm on that. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=669.72s)]
*  I put that out in my account as well. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=671.24s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking into that. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=673.84s)]
*  The pipe bomb case, which immediately, again, day one, I don't mean that figuratively, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=675.72s)]
*  I mean literally day one, after I swore in, I said, what do we got? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=679.92s)]
*  What do we got? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=683.84s)]
*  I said, get me a team. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=684.84s)]
*  I want to hear everything. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=685.84s)]
*  Get them in, brief. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=686.84s)]
*  I want to see the whole thing. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=687.84s)]
*  Pipe bomb case, Dobbs. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=688.84s)]
*  We got a, we've gotten a lot of good information on the, this is a serious case. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=690.36s)]
*  You had threats made to Supreme Court justices. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=696.14s)]
*  I get a kick out of it on social media, people are like, oh, this case isn't a big deal. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=699.36s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=703.36s)]
*  Well, I don't care that you don't care. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=704.36s)]
*  I care. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=705.88s)]
*  We just caused a big, huge, there may have been a threat case for a Supreme Court justice. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=706.88s)]
*  There is potential obstruction here. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=713.7199999999999s)]
*  This is an enormous case. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=715.48s)]
*  Cocaine in the White House. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=717.24s)]
*  Again, you know, I'm not interested in it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  You don't care what. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=720.8s)]
*  A hazardous substance made its way into the White House. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=721.8s)]
*  We didn't know what it was. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=724.4s)]
*  And we don't seem to have answers as to what it was. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=726.04s)]
*  We're going to get them. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=728.1999999999999s)]
*  I've got a great team on it. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  That was another case. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  I've been very clear on this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=732.1999999999999s)]
*  We're taking another look at this stuff. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  The public, Sean, needs to trust us again. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=735.88s)]
*  There's a lot of work to be done. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm under no illusions that in the now three months I've been here, all of a sudden, oh, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=740.56s)]
*  great, Dan Bongino's in charge. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=745.12s)]
*  We trust you again. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=746.36s)]
*  That's BS. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=747.36s)]
*  Trust is for fools. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=748.36s)]
*  Results matter. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=749.36s)]
*  I'm not asking you to trust me. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=750.36s)]
*  Trust but verify. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKAIr30cDxE&t=751.36s)]
