**Fox News - Sean Hannity:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So)
*  If we pan the faces in the crowd that have like gas masks on that have helmets on someone just threw a firecracker watch out firecracker is going to go off [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=0.0s)]
*  It's going to go off any so. Yep. There we go [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  So that's that's the point right these agitators are going to start throwing things at police that's going to put police on edge [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=10.56s)]
*  Police are going to respond with their non-lethal rounds when you take a look at these LAPD officers [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=16.62s)]
*  And you see the green neon slings on their shoulders those are their foam launchers or their rubber bullets [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  Those are their their non-lethal guns, but Sean we felt the night was going to head this way [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=26.64s)]
*  And it certainly looks like it is we're getting more of those agitators, and they always throw stuff from the back of the crowd [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=31.540000000000003s)]
*  They're not the ones who are going to be seen by LAPD [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=37.0s)]
*  They chuck something and then they run off in that case it was a firework that landed about five feet away from us right underneath [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  an LAPD car [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TW8fNd__So&t=45.88s)]
