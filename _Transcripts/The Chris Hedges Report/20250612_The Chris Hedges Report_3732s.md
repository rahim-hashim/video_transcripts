# Journalists and Their Shadows (w/ Patrick Lawrence) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk)
*  The commercial or mainstream press is a megaphone for the ruling class. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=0.0s)]
*  It genuflects before establishment politicians, generals, intelligence chiefs and corporate [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=14.8s)]
*  heads and hired apologists who carried out the corporate coup d'etat that created our [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=20.66s)]
*  system of inverted totalitarianism. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=26.2s)]
*  The corporate structures that have a stranglehold on the country and have overseen deindustrialization [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=29.52s)]
*  and the evisceration of democratic institutions, plunging over half the United States into [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=35.76s)]
*  chronic poverty and misery, are in the eyes of legacy journalists unassailable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=41.12s)]
*  They are portrayed as forces of progress. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=46.64s)]
*  The criminals on Wall Street, including the heads of financial firms such as Goldman Sachs [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=49.44s)]
*  or for-profit health care corporations such as UnitedHealthcare are treated with reverence. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=55.04s)]
*  Free trade is equated with freedom. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=61.92s)]
*  Deference is paid to democratic processes, liberties, electoral politics and rights enshrined [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=64.36s)]
*  in our constitution from due process to privacy that no longer exists. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=70.84s)]
*  It is a vast game of deception under the cover of evacuous morality. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=76.0s)]
*  Those cast aside by corporate capitalism, Noam Chomsky calls them unpeople, are rendered [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=81.14s)]
*  invisible and reviled at the same time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  The experts whose opinions are amplified on every issue from economics to empire and politics [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=89.98s)]
*  are drawn from corporate funded think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and the American [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=96.9s)]
*  Enterprise Institute. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=102.3s)]
*  Or our former military and intelligence officials or politicians who are responsible for the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=104.86s)]
*  failure of our democracy and usually in the employ of corporations. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=110.76s)]
*  Cable News also has the incestuous habit of interviewing its own news celebrities. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  The most astute critics of empire, including Andrew Bacevich, are banished as are critics [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=121.78s)]
*  of corporate power, including Ralph Nader and Noam Chomsky. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=126.64s)]
*  Those who decry the waste within the military such as MIT professor emeritus Ted Postel [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  who exposed the useless $13 billion anti-ballistic missile program are unheard. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=136.76s)]
*  Advocates of universal health care such as Dr. Margaret Flowers are locked out of national [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=143.76s)]
*  health care debates. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=149.14s)]
*  There is a long list of the censored. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=150.64s)]
*  The acceptable range of opinion is so narrow it is almost nonexistent. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=152.98s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=158.68s)]
*  How did the press turn itself into a fawning echo chamber for the billionaire class? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=159.88s)]
*  What does this mean for our fading democracy? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=164.6s)]
*  What can we do to fight back? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=167.72s)]
*  Joining me to discuss the decrepit state of journalism is Patrick Lawrence who worked [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=169.68s)]
*  for many years overseas for the International Herald Tribune and the Far Eastern Economic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  Review. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  He is the author of Journalists and Their Shadows. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  You start the book, Patrick, with a cold war. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  This was perhaps the training ground for the state that we're in. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=190.24s)]
*  You write, they delivered, you're talking about the major dailies and the networks, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  they delivered the cold war to our doorsteps, to our car radios, into our living rooms. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=199.84s)]
*  They defined a consciousness. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  They told Americans who they were and what made them American and all together what made [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  America America. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=213.04000000000002s)]
*  A free press was fundamental to this self-image and Americans nursed a deep need to believe [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=215.0s)]
*  they had one. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=219.98s)]
*  Our newspapers and networks went to elaborate lengths to give this appearance of freedom [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=221.26s)]
*  and independence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=225.74s)]
*  That this was a deception, that American media had surrendered themselves to the new national [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=226.74s)]
*  security state and its various cold war crusades is now an open and shut matter of record. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=231.98s)]
*  I count among the bitterest truths of the last 75 years of American history. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=239.1s)]
*  I'll actually go on in the book and argue that where we are now is worse. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=243.78s)]
*  Let's begin there because I think it is an important kind of winnowing journalist like [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=247.14s)]
*  I.F. Stone, of course, are pushed out of even the Nation magazine wouldn't publish Stone. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=252.98s)]
*  The Nation magazine pushed you out, I think over Ukraine, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=258.98s)]
*  Russiagate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=263.02s)]
*  Russia, Russiagate, yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=264.02s)]
*  The fantasy of Russiagate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=265.02s)]
*  But let's begin with that, what happened to the press? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=267.62s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=272.29999999999995s)]
*  Delighted to see you again. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  One of the things I wanted to do with the book, one of three, is to give the present [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=277.85999999999996s)]
*  press mess, as I call it, a history. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=286.5s)]
*  Most, I don't know what percentage of your listeners lived through those years, the cold [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=292.58s)]
*  war, part of it, all of it, none of it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=299.02s)]
*  But what's going on now has a long history. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  It goes back to the earliest days of the Cold War. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=305.82s)]
*  And it is extraordinary the extent to which the mistakes and derelictions of that time [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  are being repeated with just astonishing exactitude, the same things. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=321.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  Because the errors and corruptions of that time were never acknowledged. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  And if you don't acknowledge your mistakes, you cannot learn from them. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=339.7s)]
*  And the press is not an institution fond of learning from its mistakes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=344.14s)]
*  So I wanted to give it a history, first of all. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=350.74s)]
*  I think it's important if we're going to understand where we are first and where we [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=355.46s)]
*  might go second, you need to know the past. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=360.86s)]
*  That was my objective there. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=365.98s)]
*  Well, let's just characterize it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=369.22s)]
*  First of all, I don't think they were mistakes. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=371.7s)]
*  The careerists within the press read the landscape very, very well. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=373.78s)]
*  I once had dinner with the odious Joseph Alsop, who proceeded to get drunker and drunker [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=378.78s)]
*  and I was a young graduate student. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=384.82s)]
*  I was a seminary student and rail turned on me in this company and rail on my generation [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=388.54s)]
*  who didn't know the Bible or Shakespeare, both of which I knew far better than Joseph Alsop. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=394.42s)]
*  I read the Bible in Greek. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=399.46s)]
*  So but let's talk a little bit about, you know, that you developed a class of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=401.34s)]
*  journalists who catered to what C. Wright Mill is called the power elite during the Cold War. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=408.7s)]
*  Many of them, as you point out in the book, were recruited by the CIA or at least served [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=414.58000000000004s)]
*  as useful idiots for the CIA in terms of feeding information. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=421.82s)]
*  This was very common in the Cold War. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=427.98s)]
*  They signed on. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=431.54s)]
*  If you signed on for that quote unquote crusade for patriotism against communism, you did [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=432.54s)]
*  very, very well and you've worked at the International Herald Tribune. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=438.70000000000005s)]
*  I worked at the New York Times. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=442.18s)]
*  We're talking about consummate careerists. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=443.62s)]
*  So what you call, we're the mistakes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=445.18s)]
*  We're the ones who actually thought journalism was about integrity and got pushed out. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=447.46s)]
*  So let's be clear about that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=451.72s)]
*  These people didn't make a mistake. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=452.98s)]
*  They made very astute career choices. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=454.22s)]
*  Let me change, I stand corrected. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=456.42s)]
*  Let me change the word, not mistakes, transgressions. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=459.94s)]
*  Can we live with that? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=463.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=464.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=465.5s)]
*  Transgressions of principle. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=466.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=467.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=468.5s)]
*  But the, where to begin? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=469.5s)]
*  There are a few ways to discuss this. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=475.38s)]
*  One is the professionalization of the craft. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=478.06s)]
*  There are two ways to use that term. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=485.06s)]
*  One is to learn your trade, learn your techniques and all that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=489.02s)]
*  You're a professional in your procedures. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=495.42s)]
*  I quite value that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=497.7s)]
*  The way I mean it in the book is professionalization as it began in the 1920s when journalists [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=499.58s)]
*  began to identify themselves not as residents of an independent pole of power reporting [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=512.18s)]
*  on the institutions. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=522.42s)]
*  They would be charged with observing. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=524.78s)]
*  But as part of the power structure, a disastrous drift in the profession, right, it goes back [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=529.5s)]
*  to Walter Lippman in the 20s. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=540.8199999999999s)]
*  He wrote three books about the press. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=543.62s)]
*  That's what, in a certain way, that's what they were about. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=545.42s)]
*  So the professionalization. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=548.98s)]
*  Lippman is an extremely important figure because his thesis is that the general public is just [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=554.78s)]
*  too clueless to understand how to manage ruling institutions. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  And therefore, he argues, in essence, that they should be kept in ignorance, manipulated, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=567.22s)]
*  used, and that should be left up to what you call the quote unquote professional class, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  including this new professional class, the press. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=578.5s)]
*  And as you point out in the book, before all this, journalists were working class stiffs [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=581.26s)]
*  who didn't go to college. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=586.26s)]
*  And that, I mean, you could hold a sizable reunion for any Ivy League school now in the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=589.74s)]
*  newsroom of the New York Times, or at least when I was there. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=594.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=597.54s)]
*  I mean, Mencken is great on that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=598.54s)]
*  I quote him saying, you know, in the old days, a reporter made the same salary as a bartender [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=601.34s)]
*  or a police sergeant. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=608.46s)]
*  Now he's making what a doctor or a lawyer makes. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=610.26s)]
*  He noted that with some regret. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=614.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=616.66s)]
*  Now, with Lippman, I mentioned later in the book what are known as the Lippman-Dewey debates [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=617.66s)]
*  in the 1920s. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=625.54s)]
*  In fact, there were never any formal debates, but they exchanged by way of their books and [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=626.54s)]
*  reviews of their books. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=633.02s)]
*  Lippman considered, as you say very well, the pub. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=636.02s)]
*  These two were formulating these ideas as America was becoming a mass society. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=641.5799999999999s)]
*  That's the background. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=648.5799999999999s)]
*  And Lippman considered people are simply incapable of learning, you know, of understanding the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=650.3s)]
*  world around them. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=662.46s)]
*  They have to be told what's going on. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=664.28s)]
*  They're too busy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=667.56s)]
*  They're too distant from power. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=668.8s)]
*  So the function of the journalist is as a messenger, if you will, right, sort of a tribune. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=671.12s)]
*  Part of the power elite, bearing the policies and judgments and directives of the powerful, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=680.8399999999999s)]
*  the political structure downward to the population. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=693.32s)]
*  That was his notion of what the press was supposed to do. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=699.44s)]
*  Along came Dewey. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=704.32s)]
*  I'm not a great Dewey man, but I think he was correct in this, right? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=705.32s)]
*  He said, no, the journalist has to stand, as I put it, has to stand in a different place. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=713.1800000000001s)]
*  He has to stand outside of power and present to readers and viewers the known considerations [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=719.98s)]
*  whenever a question of national policy was at issue and engender a public debate so people [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  could draw their conclusions and register those conclusions. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=743.72s)]
*  That was the function of the journalist, right? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=748.48s)]
*  Again, I have a lot of problems with Dewey. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=751.22s)]
*  That's a separate conversation. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=754.34s)]
*  But on this point, where the journalist was located, he was right, right? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=756.1s)]
*  Now what do we have now? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  We have an emphatically Lipmanite press corps, right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=764.02s)]
*  These people don't eat so far as they can make out, are completely happy that this is [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=769.34s)]
*  understood as we're talking about it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=778.02s)]
*  We are part of the power structure and we are handing down to you what's going to happen, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=779.38s)]
*  supposedly why, although that's never very clear, and how you should think. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=789.42s)]
*  Remember it was Lipman who gave us the manufacture of consent. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=795.1s)]
*  That was in one of the three books he wrote in the 20s, the period I'm talking about, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=801.14s)]
*  right? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=806.14s)]
*  Let's talk about what happened. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=808.04s)]
*  You write that everything began to close after the 1975 defeats in Southeast Asia wounded [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  the American psyche and rattled the power elite. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=824.08s)]
*  Then it disappeared more or less completely as the Cold War years gave way to the post [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=827.0s)]
*  Cold War triumphalism that marked the 1990s. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=832.08s)]
*  There followed the events of 2001, these were the 9-11 attacks. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=835.56s)]
*  These proved a decisive moment in our media's return to the worst of many bad habits they [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=841.0999999999999s)]
*  had formed during the 1950s. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=846.38s)]
*  You mark that notion of a unipolar world with the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=852.6999999999999s)]
*  I was in Eastern and Central Europe then and watched it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=857.7399999999999s)]
*  Then you also mark 9-11 when the country, after these attacks, drank that very dark [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=861.52s)]
*  elixir of nationalism. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=867.98s)]
*  The flip side of nationalism, of course, is racism. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=871.66s)]
*  It began these military debacles that continue to this day in Ukraine and Gaza and everywhere [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=876.06s)]
*  else. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=884.02s)]
*  Talk about those historical moments. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=885.02s)]
*  I remember beginning the afternoon of September 11th and running for some days afterward, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=890.24s)]
*  the constant repetition of the planes colliding with the towers. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=897.74s)]
*  I'm sure everyone listening will recall that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=904.1s)]
*  My view is that that was what the literary critics call an objective correlative. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=908.9s)]
*  That moment was really most profoundly understood as a matter of psychology. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=916.42s)]
*  Americans until that moment were taught from Winthrop onward that we are immune from history. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=925.74s)]
*  As Toynbee once said, history is what happens to other people. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=938.22s)]
*  At that moment, that mythology came to an end. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=944.18s)]
*  Suddenly we are as vulnerable to time and history as the rest of the world. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=949.14s)]
*  It was a profound shock. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=954.5799999999999s)]
*  I think at the level of the Imperium, the policy cliques began to understand the world [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=958.02s)]
*  had profoundly changed. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=968.2199999999999s)]
*  At that point, the press needed to be—so it was a new set of circumstances—well, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=973.62s)]
*  new, but with a history. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=982.58s)]
*  A new set of circumstances and the press had to be recruited. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=987.78s)]
*  There's a passage in the book recounting what happened a few days after 9-11. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=992.02s)]
*  Bush's press secretary—forgive me, I forget his name. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1004.5s)]
*  Ari Fletcher. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1007.38s)]
*  Ari Fletcher called in all the heavyweights in the Washington press corps, the senior [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1008.26s)]
*  editors, mostly, perhaps a correspondent here or there, maybe Tom Friedman, people like [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1019.14s)]
*  that, and said, look, we don't want you reporting stories that reflect badly on what [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1023.06s)]
*  we are about to start doing. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1031.66s)]
*  Meaning, as they say, sources and methods. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1034.7s)]
*  We know what those turned out to be, the ugliness of it all. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1039.74s)]
*  Jill Abramson, the Washington bureau chief at the Times at that moment, later the executive [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1044.3s)]
*  editor to no great result, recounted that conversation. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1050.5s)]
*  And she said, we all readily agreed to cooperate. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1057.42s)]
*  And she added, and indeed, for many years, we never wrote anything that displeased the [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1062.18s)]
*  White House. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1067.18s)]
*  It was a very important moment. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1069.02s)]
*  And I picked that time because that's my date for the very sudden, abrupt end of the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1072.38s)]
*  American century. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1078.7s)]
*  Not everybody agrees with me, but that's my date. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1080.6200000000001s)]
*  It's been making messes ever since in the aftermath. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1084.26s)]
*  At that moment, the gears shifted, so to speak, and the press got right onside the way they [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1091.78s)]
*  did in Truman's later years and through the 50s as a reenlisted soldier. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1097.98s)]
*  That's why I picked 2001. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1111.38s)]
*  Well 2001 was finally the rest of the world spoke to us in the language that we, for decades, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1115.78s)]
*  used to speak to them, which was death and explosions in a city skyline. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1124.1799999999998s)]
*  And you're right, and this is from your book on that issue, their purpose turned subtly [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1130.58s)]
*  at first and then very plainly from informing the public to protecting the institutions [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1138.78s)]
*  they purported to report upon from the public's gaze. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1143.1799999999998s)]
*  We should also note, although it's not raised in your book, that this coincided with the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1146.1399999999999s)]
*  economic downturn at media institutions and in particular major dailies so that their [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1150.82s)]
*  advertising revenues became so constricted and they became even more obsequious to the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1159.02s)]
*  centers of power. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1165.26s)]
*  And you had written earlier that there was a place in the mainstream then, if not a large [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1168.26s)]
*  place for journalists who held to the ideals, principles, and purpose that commonly draw [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1173.94s)]
*  people into the profession. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1178.66s)]
*  But I think the twin combination, and I was based in Paris and covered Al-Qaeda for the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1182.0600000000002s)]
*  New York Times in Europe and the Middle East, and so was part of those discussions along [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1189.46s)]
*  with the odious Judy Miller at the New York Times. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1196.94s)]
*  I would come back to New York for these meetings. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1201.26s)]
*  But they were all, it wasn't that they were cynical, they were all true believers. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1204.5s)]
*  And the French who did not want us to go into Iraq had given me massive access to very secret [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1209.1799999999998s)]
*  intelligence that they had in an effort, not because I was a great reporter, but because [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1217.6599999999999s)]
*  it was the New York Times. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1222.9399999999998s)]
*  And I would come back with very hard information because Iraq of course had nothing to do with [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1224.6999999999998s)]
*  the attacks of 9-11 and it would just be dismissed. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1230.86s)]
*  Well, that's not what Dick Cheney told us, that's not what Lewis Scooter Libby told us, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1234.94s)]
*  that's not Richard Pearl. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1237.7s)]
*  So it was completely unquestioning. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1239.9s)]
*  And as you write, the major dailies and the wire services routinely report the assertions [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1245.7800000000002s)]
*  of government officials as if these assertions alone were evidence of their veracity. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1250.0400000000002s)]
*  And that is of course precisely what happened. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1256.7800000000002s)]
*  And I want to talk about, it was a little thing but important that you picked up on, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1260.94s)]
*  and it was this, what you call this Jekyll and Hyde quality of you were working for the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1267.58s)]
*  International Herald Tribune, I was working for the New York Times, and I immediately [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1272.26s)]
*  knew what you were speaking about. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1277.02s)]
*  And what it is, is this split because these institutions pay deference to all of these [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1279.26s)]
*  values, journalistic independence and fearlessness and democracy dies in darkness or whatever. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1286.86s)]
*  But of course, they are, it's a masquerade, they are serving the centers of power. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1293.98s)]
*  But for journalists who actually care about those values, it makes these institutions [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1299.58s)]
*  rife with anxiety. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1306.06s)]
*  I had a colleague of great conscience who used to come into the New York Times and go [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1307.06s)]
*  to the bathroom and throw up every morning before he went to work. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1312.08s)]
*  And you put that tension, and you do write about that within the institution, but I [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1315.76s)]
*  don't want to let that go because I think it's important. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1320.76s)]
*  You tipped me into the second of three themes I wanted to explore in the book, and that's [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1324.96s)]
*  reflected in the title, Journalists in Their Shadows, not to go too far into psychoanalysis, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1332.72s)]
*  but I drew that from Jung, who argued we all have what he called shadows, that part of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1339.3s)]
*  ourselves that is obscured by social convention, orthodox morality, acceptance among peers, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1348.8s)]
*  the coercions of professional coercions from employers and all that. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1365.5s)]
*  It creates in all of us something Jung called the shadow, the hidden self, the obscured [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1370.86s)]
*  self. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1377.26s)]
*  Now, okay, my argument is that is exceptionally important. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1378.26s)]
*  I can't overstate this, exceptionally important in the case of journalists because when they [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1388.62s)]
*  themselves are divided, that's when the compromises begin. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1396.2600000000002s)]
*  It's a psychological question, it's a psychosocial question. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1406.1000000000001s)]
*  The corruptions in the press begin with the corruptions of the personalities who want [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1411.0200000000002s)]
*  to get paid, want to be promoted, and so on. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1418.46s)]
*  My argument, I call it disintegration. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1423.6599999999999s)]
*  As I mentioned, the pastor in my little New England town taught me the relationship between [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1427.5s)]
*  two words, integration and integrity. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1433.3s)]
*  Working in the mainstream, I'm sure it was your experience, I'll bet it was, that people [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1441.98s)]
*  become loyal to the orthodoxies imposed by employers and before you, they become so immersed [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1450.78s)]
*  in it, they don't even know their condition of alienation from themselves. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1463.5s)]
*  It's a serious thing and very serious phenomenon. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1473.9s)]
*  Now, the small place allowed for journalists and correspondents who were able to defend [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1479.22s)]
*  their ideals and principles. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1492.5s)]
*  I had this experience myself and I was encouraged to explore the thought by the late John Pilger, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1495.8600000000001s)]
*  who is older than me by some years, but that was his experience too. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1503.42s)]
*  He encouraged me to recognize it was there, but it closed out. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1510.46s)]
*  It was never a large space, but it shut down. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1516.3400000000001s)]
*  Again, after 2001, I think, is when that happened. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1520.5s)]
*  It was never a generously proportioned section of the segment of the craft, but it was there. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1527.98s)]
*  Suddenly, it wasn't there. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1537.22s)]
*  It was there, but you were a management headache and if you were not finally domesticated, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1539.8600000000001s)]
*  they pushed you out. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1548.46s)]
*  It was there, but none of these reporters had a long shelf life within the institution. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1553.1s)]
*  Sidney Schanbert was a friend of mine from the killing fields and won the Pulitzer in [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1562.3799999999999s)]
*  Cambodia. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1566.3799999999999s)]
*  He came back, ran the Metro Desk, went after the big developers that were friends of the [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1567.3799999999999s)]
*  publisher and he was finished. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1571.3799999999999s)]
*  Abe Rosenthal, the editor during that period of the New York Times, used to call him my [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1573.98s)]
*  little commie. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1579.78s)]
*  I just have to read this little description from the New York Times because although I [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1581.62s)]
*  didn't spend much time in the newsroom, I was hired by the foreign desk, spent seven [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1585.74s)]
*  months, which was enough, and then went back overseas. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1588.98s)]
*  The 43rd Street newsroom, that's the old Times building, turned out to be worse, because [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1593.6599999999999s)]
*  you worked briefly for the New York Times as an editor, turned out to be worse than [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1598.54s)]
*  my worst imaginings. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1601.9399999999998s)]
*  Ill will and bloody mindedness were ground into the worn industrial carpet. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1603.74s)]
*  There was too much power at stake, my diagnosis, and too many people pursuing it too single [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1608.24s)]
*  mindedly. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1613.16s)]
*  Editors and reporters seemed to think solely of appearing clever out front where the managing [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1614.54s)]
*  editors sat. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1619.64s)]
*  I could detect only slight interest in what was going on in the world and into the news [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1620.96s)]
*  pages. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1625.52s)]
*  No wonder so many journalists, forgetting why they were journalists, were indifferent [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1626.52s)]
*  to or simply unaware of their place in the ideological order. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1630.32s)]
*  wise and getting out never seemed so fine an idea. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1635.68s)]
*  This disintegration that you mentioned, and I'm sure you saw this, it breaks these people. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1640.68s)]
*  By the time these reporters and editors who come in, obviously with a certain amount of [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1647.44s)]
*  idealism, they are completely broken individuals. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1652.4s)]
*  There's a Willy Loman type quality to these guys in their 50s. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1656.4s)]
*  They just have been destroyed by these institutions. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1661.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1664.4s)]
*  It's a psychological phenomenon. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1667.68s)]
*  I reference this term of Sartre's mauvais foie, bad faith. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1674.52s)]
*  They become reenactments of journalists. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1682.3200000000002s)]
*  Newspapers are reenactments of newspapers. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1687.24s)]
*  There's a kind of meta quality to it. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1690.72s)]
*  Two points. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1697.16s)]
*  One, it's endemic. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1698.16s)]
*  People drawing salaries from the washpost or the Times listening to this now would, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1701.16s)]
*  I'm certain, would either not know what we were talking about, not because they're immune [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1707.28s)]
*  to the phenomenon, but because they're so far inside it they can't see out, or they [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1713.56s)]
*  would deny it vehemently with the passionate conviction of converts because they have assumed [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1718.32s)]
*  the ideology of he who writes the checks. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  I mention Descartes in the book. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1737.04s)]
*  I think, therefore I am becomes I am, therefore I think. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1740.12s)]
*  I am a Washington Post reporter, and therefore I think this. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1745.04s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1749.88s)]
*  Second point here to rotate the perspective. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1752.8s)]
*  This is why I don't have a great deal of hope for the mainstream press, legacy press, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1757.24s)]
*  however you wish to call it, coming good on all these questions. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1764.84s)]
*  I think it's a self-destructed institution, and it's why I put the considerable faith, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1769.48s)]
*  if faith is the word, why I put considerable confidence in independent media as the source [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1780.64s)]
*  of the profession's dynamism and future. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1790.4s)]
*  All of that is true except of course the digital platforms that are now embedded in the national [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1795.28s)]
*  security state are using every, whether it's algorithms or deplatforming or demonetizing [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1799.92s)]
*  to essentially stomp out independent media. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1805.48s)]
*  I want to talk about another important point that you make, having been a foreign correspondent, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1808.3600000000001s)]
*  which you call the reality of difference. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1812.52s)]
*  The making and maintaining of a psychological construct commonly called self and other, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1815.72s)]
*  is an extremely important point in terms of how you report the world. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1821.2s)]
*  You also bring up the fact that large newspapers like the New York Times, they'll never let [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1826.6000000000001s)]
*  you stay in a foreign bureau more than three to five years because of what you write about, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1832.4s)]
*  this reality of difference. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1839.6000000000001s)]
*  Explain what that is and why buttresses not only are ignorance but a particular world view. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the reality of difference means very simply American ideology, if I can use that [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1847.6s)]
*  blanket term, requires that we distinguish ourselves as the exceptional people on the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1860.04s)]
*  face of the earth and all others are in one measure others. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1867.7199999999998s)]
*  If you're talking about the French or the British, okay, they are a friendly people, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1876.08s)]
*  sympathetic people, but they are fundamentally different from us. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1883.0s)]
*  Their systems are different. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1891.12s)]
*  Well, French have quite a good healthcare system, but that's friends, they're different, right? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1893.48s)]
*  When you get to non-Western people beginning at the top of the pyramid with the Japanese [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1901.52s)]
*  and on down, they are really very different and to report those sort of places, I from [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1907.68s)]
*  the beginning of my career was interested in non-Western countries, third world problems [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1916.96s)]
*  and all that. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1924.0s)]
*  These people are profoundly sort of, if I may say, otherized, right? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1927.64s)]
*  You report them as almost specimens, right? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1934.4s)]
*  You report them from behind a pane of glass through which you will never pass. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1941.76s)]
*  You mentioned the standard tour for a correspondent three to five years, that's right, because [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1953.2s)]
*  after that period, correspondents tend to understand the country or countries they're [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1961.2s)]
*  reporting a little too well for the foreign editor's taste, right? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1967.8s)]
*  Wait a minute, you're actually writing about this country from their perspective, you're [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1972.96s)]
*  showing us the world the way it looks to these people. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1978.44s)]
*  If you were in Berlin, you've got to go to Buenos Aires now, right? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1982.76s)]
*  Start all over again. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1987.84s)]
*  Don't understand others too thoroughly. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1989.76s)]
*  That's the... [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1994.32s)]
*  Well, the point is you begin not only to understand them, you begin to understand us. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=1995.32s)]
*  Yeah, they're all viewers. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2000.32s)]
*  That's what they don't want. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2002.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the correspondent, a good one, the light bulb goes on some years into an [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2003.48s)]
*  assignment. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2011.2s)]
*  I am asking a thousand questions and as I get the answers, I'm learning about myself. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2012.64s)]
*  There's another aspect you lift up which I think is important. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2021.0400000000002s)]
*  You talk about how Western correspondents covering the non-West de-factualized the story [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2023.6000000000001s)]
*  and you're right about that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2030.52s)]
*  Explain what you mean by that. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2032.44s)]
*  Well, my experience was primarily, my formative years as a correspondent were late 70s, the [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2033.72s)]
*  height of the Cold War or maybe a little past its peak but still a very serious reality. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2047.3600000000001s)]
*  I reported primarily in East Asia, not only in East Asia but primarily. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2055.68s)]
*  You had the dictatorships in Korea, Indonesia, the famous case of the Marcos in the Philippines, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  so to speak strongman governments in Malaysia, places like that. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2077.0s)]
*  And then the Japanese case, we reinvented the Japanese after the 45 defeat and installed [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2085.32s)]
*  the Liberal Democratic Party and made sure it stayed there and installed. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2094.48s)]
*  We couldn't report these phenomena as they were. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2100.88s)]
*  We couldn't proceed into the zone of cause and effect. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2106.04s)]
*  How did the South Korean dictators get there? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2113.0800000000004s)]
*  How did Suharto get there in 65 when Sukarno, who I love Sukarno, he was one of the great [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2117.1200000000003s)]
*  people of the 20th century, when he was deposed in a CIA operation, these things could not [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2127.5600000000004s)]
*  be discussed. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2135.1200000000003s)]
*  It was all about, in the case of the Japanese, the Japanese miracle. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2138.74s)]
*  There was no miracle in Japan. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2145.7s)]
*  It was what I call a Cold War social contract. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2150.2999999999997s)]
*  America committed to buying the exports of all these countries. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2158.18s)]
*  This is why the East Asians are so addicted to exports. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2164.22s)]
*  Committed to buying the exports of these countries so that they could make a social contract [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2169.02s)]
*  with their citizens that went this way. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2174.98s)]
*  We will give you material prosperity. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2179.22s)]
*  You can have a refrigerator or a color TV or a little tiny Japanese car, maybe for the [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2183.8999999999996s)]
*  first time in your family's history, but you can't touch politics. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2190.22s)]
*  That's the deal. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2196.7s)]
*  But we couldn't, you could watch this if you were alert and immune to the ideological [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2200.54s)]
*  ruts. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2209.02s)]
*  You could understand it, but you couldn't write about it. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2212.14s)]
*  This raises the other point, and that is the absence of context, absence of history. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2220.46s)]
*  I like Robert Fisk. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2227.54s)]
*  I don't know if you knew him. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2228.54s)]
*  I didn't know him, but I certainly knew of him. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2230.74s)]
*  His book, The Great War for Civilization, which is a great book on the modern Middle [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2234.18s)]
*  East, but it marries his reporting. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2237.7s)]
*  He was in the Middle East for 44 years. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2240.42s)]
*  It marries his reporting with his deep understanding of history. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2242.62s)]
*  But if you don't understand the history and nothing is contextualized, then when you get [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2246.98s)]
*  an eruption, for instance on October 7th by the Palestinians with incursion into Israel, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2252.7s)]
*  because it's not put in context, it's presented within the media as incomprehensible, and [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2258.66s)]
*  with it, the people who carried it out become incomprehensible. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2264.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2268.38s)]
*  I mean, this happens. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2269.38s)]
*  I don't need to tell you, Chris. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2272.5s)]
*  This happens as a matter of daily routine as we speak, right? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2275.04s)]
*  Context is an essential context in history. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2281.92s)]
*  I had a list of five things. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2289.2s)]
*  Context, history, causality, agency, and responsibility are all essential for us to understand events [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  in the world around us. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2303.12s)]
*  And none is permitted to any effective extent in corporate media. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2305.8s)]
*  Things happen out of nowhere. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2316.26s)]
*  Why did that happen? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2319.8s)]
*  Well, those other people, there's no explaining them, right? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2321.28s)]
*  It doesn't make sense to us because we're different from them, et cetera, right? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2327.3s)]
*  Here's a good one. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2332.48s)]
*  Here's a perfect one for us. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2334.04s)]
*  The unprovoked Russian military operation in Ukraine, unprovoked, unprovoked, unprovoked, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2337.88s)]
*  that is the stripping out of history and context. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2347.0s)]
*  Plain and simple. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2350.88s)]
*  In this case, it's so boldly deceitful. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2353.08s)]
*  You don't have to be a graduate student in history at the University of Wisconsin to [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2358.2s)]
*  know what went on before February 24, 2022. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2364.3599999999997s)]
*  30 years of it, right? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2369.68s)]
*  And then the coup in 2014, the eight years of bombardment, savage bombardment of Russian [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2372.68s)]
*  speakers in the East, it's all there. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2381.96s)]
*  But the media erase it with exceptional daring. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2386.12s)]
*  And the force of media, the force of incessant presentation makes this kind of thing so regrettably [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2395.2s)]
*  effective, right? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2406.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we mean by context. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2408.44s)]
*  Perfect example. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2411.3999999999996s)]
*  I want to talk about, you quote from the book, the eclipse of reason. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2412.48s)]
*  Reason as an organ for perceiving the true nature of reality and determining the guiding [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2419.52s)]
*  principles of our lives, as Horkheimer writes, has come to be regarded as obsolete. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2423.6800000000003s)]
*  And you write, this surrender to the irrational does great damage to the surrendering society [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2429.4s)]
*  as is evident as we look out our windows. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2437.28s)]
*  It is near to fatal for the practice of journalism. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2441.12s)]
*  Talk about that surrender to the irrational. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2444.4s)]
*  Okay, I like that book, Horkheimer's book. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2448.64s)]
*  It's not a very long book. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2452.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a very accessible book if any of your listeners or reviewers are interested in finding [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2455.08s)]
*  it. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2460.88s)]
*  You can find it on the used book sites, the eclipse of reason. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2461.88s)]
*  What he was talking about, and this was 1947 that was published, listeners take note, that [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2468.04s)]
*  was the beginning of the Cold War, right? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2474.64s)]
*  He's talking about the Socratic process of reasoning is you take a circumstance and you [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2478.48s)]
*  advance through the known universe of facts and evidence and you arrive at a conclusion. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2492.12s)]
*  You are not in charge of the conclusion. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2502.94s)]
*  What you learn on the way will lead you to the correct conclusion. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2506.7799999999997s)]
*  This has been turned upside down in our hyper ideological polity such that you draw your [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2511.14s)]
*  conclusion first and then you reason backwards, right? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2523.9s)]
*  Russiagate a perfect example. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2529.54s)]
*  This is how it has to come out. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2533.2999999999997s)]
*  Now let's reason backwards to support the conclusion we've already drawn. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2535.82s)]
*  It's a living disaster for our profession given that we trade in facts and evidence [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2544.6600000000003s)]
*  and research. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2553.7000000000003s)]
*  As the wonderful Bob Perry put it, he's in the book briefly, I don't care what the truth [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2557.36s)]
*  is, I just care what the truth is. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2565.5s)]
*  That's out the window now. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2568.8599999999997s)]
*  I care what the truth is and I'm going to make a case to support my version of the truth. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2571.54s)]
*  It's not an operative way to conduct yourself as a journalist but pick up any major daily, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2580.18s)]
*  that's what you're reading. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2590.18s)]
*  I want to talk, it's a small point but it of course resonated with me because I've experienced [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2592.2999999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2596.4199999999996s)]
*  They don't ever embrace the ideology they promote but the way that they censor, and [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2598.74s)]
*  you're writing about one of your own experiences, you say stories written beyond the ideological [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2610.3799999999997s)]
*  fence posts are never thrown back for that reason. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2615.56s)]
*  Because the fence posts cannot be acknowledged, it is always we want better sourcing or not [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2619.14s)]
*  enough solid reporting here or the catch-all, you don't support your case. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2624.46s)]
*  You must have, I'm ringing some of your bells here, right? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2630.74s)]
*  I laid that out because any professional reading the book will say, oh my God, yeah, that, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2640.02s)]
*  right. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2647.2599999999998s)]
*  I recounted one of my direct experiences when in my latter days at the Herald Tribune, the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2648.26s)]
*  New York Times had bought out the Washington, it was a condominium ownership, the New York [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2659.1800000000003s)]
*  Times owned 50% and the Post owned 50%. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2665.9s)]
*  But let me just interrupt, Patrick, it was a good newspaper because it had editorial [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2669.2200000000003s)]
*  independence from the Post. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2673.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and the head office was in Paris. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2674.0200000000004s)]
*  But made a big difference. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2676.74s)]
*  But anyway, the Times made the Post a very unpleasant offer it couldn't refuse and [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2678.98s)]
*  so the Times suddenly owned all of it. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2685.06s)]
*  Well, they threatened to destroy the Herald Tribune. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2687.5s)]
*  Let's be clear, it was like the mafia. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2689.46s)]
*  You know the story. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2692.34s)]
*  And so the Times, the Trib, you know, it was one of those publications where there was [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2694.58s)]
*  that space we were discussing earlier. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2701.42s)]
*  The Trib began the process of Timesification and that is the occasion for the one experience [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2707.02s)]
*  I had, right? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2721.78s)]
*  I had been editing the Asian edition. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2725.02s)]
*  They took me off of that because they needed a Times man and they made me sort of a roving [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2728.5s)]
*  correspondent for the region, right? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2735.58s)]
*  Okay, I kind of thought my correspondent days were over but I said, all right, let's try [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2738.78s)]
*  this. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2744.22s)]
*  And I wrote a story that I knew very, I thought, you better get this over with. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2745.22s)]
*  You better determine once and for all who these people are. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2752.9s)]
*  I wrote a story for them that was a very good Herald Tribune story. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2757.78s)]
*  No ideology, kind of a worldly perspective, not informed by any kind of nationalist orthodoxy. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2767.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, just look at things the way they are. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2779.78s)]
*  This is one reason I think the location of the Trib's newsroom in Paris was important. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2783.34s)]
*  Write that story and see what happens. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2791.06s)]
*  Let me just interrupt. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2794.98s)]
*  It was a story about the decline of American influence and hegemony. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2795.98s)]
*  The rise of what we call a multipolar world, especially China. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2801.1400000000003s)]
*  Russia, China, Iran peripherally, you know, as I say in the book, I'll eat my hat or [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2805.5s)]
*  anything else people propose if that story written in 2006 is not the world that's out [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2812.98s)]
*  our windows today, right? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2820.16s)]
*  So I wrote the story and I filed the story and it came back from my editor with all these, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2822.54s)]
*  not really objections, but do a little more work here, right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2830.78s)]
*  As I say in the piece, in the book, the piece was brass plated by the time I gave it to [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2837.82s)]
*  them because I knew it would face headwinds. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2843.98s)]
*  My editor in Hong Kong finally gave up. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2848.98s)]
*  I answered all his questions. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2852.5800000000004s)]
*  So he sent it to Paris. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2855.1800000000003s)]
*  The newsroom in Paris raised all sorts of other questions. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2859.58s)]
*  I answered those questions. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2862.66s)]
*  They still didn't want to publish it. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2865.38s)]
*  They sent it to New York. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2866.68s)]
*  And then the foreign editor, some national security correspondents whose name I'd love [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2871.02s)]
*  to mention but won't, and some bureau chiefs in Asia had a look at it, right? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2878.2999999999997s)]
*  Now the conflicts of interest are glow in the dark. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2885.3s)]
*  I had a story they didn't have and they went on and on about one of them said, oh, tired [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2890.42s)]
*  old sources, you know, another one said what I said and what I repeated in the book, poorly [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2897.1000000000004s)]
*  sourced, can't tell what it's about and so on. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2904.78s)]
*  And finally it popped out the other end of the pipeline from my editor in Hong Kong, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2907.94s)]
*  Patrick, we just can't run this. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2917.7000000000003s)]
*  That's all. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2922.34s)]
*  We just can't run this. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2923.34s)]
*  You're talking, here's my favorite, you're talking about the upper echelons of American [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2924.94s)]
*  journalism. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2930.1s)]
*  As I say in the book, I have a great affection for that phrase ever since, the upper echelons [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2931.84s)]
*  of American journalism. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2937.7s)]
*  That's what happens. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2939.8199999999997s)]
*  Nobody at any time, this is your point, nobody at any time could say, Patrick, this is not [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2941.4199999999996s)]
*  the orthodoxy. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2947.22s)]
*  We're defending American primacy here and you're questioning it. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2950.4199999999996s)]
*  That was the rub. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2954.3799999999997s)]
*  But that can't be said. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2955.74s)]
*  So there's a, Cy Hirsch wrote a great memoir, reporter, which everyone should read, but [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2957.66s)]
*  recounts exactly a long investigative piece he did on Gulf and Western. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2963.58s)]
*  Very similar process. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2967.62s)]
*  He left the paper not long after that. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2968.62s)]
*  But before we close, I want to ask, because I have a slight disagreement with you, you [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2971.7s)]
*  hold up WikiLeaks, the coverage of the Vietnam War, Watergate, all as moments of integrity [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2975.66s)]
*  that may not be your word in American journalism. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2986.38s)]
*  I don't. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2988.86s)]
*  The Vietnam War, for me, the coverage changed once public opinion changed. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2990.94s)]
*  The press is a reactive force that doesn't lead in terms of Watergate. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=2995.86s)]
*  All of those tactics, this is Snomchomsky, had been used on anti-war groups and dissidents, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3000.1400000000003s)]
*  the Black Panthers, including assassinating Fred Hampton. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3005.1400000000003s)]
*  But the press didn't care about it until the elites started devouring their own, i.e. the [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3011.38s)]
*  Republican administration of Nixon went after the Democratic Party. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3016.82s)]
*  And in the case of WikiLeaks, and I was at the New York Times, I think that they were [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3020.58s)]
*  shamed that by not publishing the revelations of WikiLeaks, they would have been exposed [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3027.74s)]
*  for who they were. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3034.2599999999998s)]
*  They did, though, that publication, a collaboration with Julian Assange with their teeth grit, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3035.5s)]
*  and knew the moment the ink was dry, their next step was to destroy Julian Assange. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3042.42s)]
*  I just comment briefly on that, and then I want to talk about where we're going. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3049.7s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3055.22s)]
*  Yeah, I understand. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3057.22s)]
*  What you seem to be saying is the political environment counted in all of these cases. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3059.7s)]
*  Watergate would not have happened if considerable factions of the Washington power elite had [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3066.7799999999997s)]
*  turned against Nixon. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3074.22s)]
*  The coverage we in the profession and others, I suppose, admire from Vietnam, Halberstam, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3077.66s)]
*  Malcolm Brown, Miehlsche, and all those people. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3084.62s)]
*  I don't think that coverage would have come to be if considerable portions of the power [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3089.02s)]
*  elite in Washington, the policy cliques, and of course the anti-war movement hadn't turned [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3096.62s)]
*  against the war. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3101.8599999999997s)]
*  That's what I mean by political environment counts. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3103.94s)]
*  WikiLeaks, I hadn't thought of it the way you do. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3107.86s)]
*  They were embarrassed. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3111.14s)]
*  I remember in autumn of 2010 when there was a big release of WikiLeaks documents. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3112.14s)]
*  Forgive me, I can't remember which ones they were. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3122.18s)]
*  2010 were the Iraqi war logs. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3124.62s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3126.94s)]
*  I remember on the front page of the Times, David Sanger, happy to mention his name, acknowledged [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3127.94s)]
*  that the Times has checked with the administration to make sure of what we can publish and what [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3135.54s)]
*  we can't. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3144.02s)]
*  You tell that story later on, people can't believe it, but it was there and it's in [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3145.9s)]
*  fact it's routine. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3150.14s)]
*  Okay, I think the key, I had it a little differently than you. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3152.18s)]
*  I thought, I took it that the corporate media, mainstream press, saw in the Assange operation [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3158.02s)]
*  a real change in what journalism could be. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3174.06s)]
*  But I think you might be closer to the mark. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3178.38s)]
*  They had no choice. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3183.6400000000003s)]
*  The key moment I think is when Pompeo, the odious Pompeo, gave a speech at CSIS I think [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3185.9s)]
*  and called Assange a Russian actor, all these phrases they make up, and turned on him. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3194.42s)]
*  That was, forgive me my dates, 2011, 2012. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3203.22s)]
*  That's when the media turned and said, okay, we can go after this guy now. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3209.4199999999996s)]
*  He became a sort of, as I recount in the book, a sort of sacred outcast, right? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3215.8599999999997s)]
*  They went right to town on Assange, just in the way you have suggested. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3222.4599999999996s)]
*  Key leaks threatened their entire model of journalism. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3230.02s)]
*  They had to destroy him. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3233.3s)]
*  I can tell you, because I know, I was inside with Bill Keller and all these other, they [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3235.74s)]
*  hated. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3240.9s)]
*  Were you still inside the paper at that time? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3241.9s)]
*  In 2010, no. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3246.94s)]
*  But of course I know all these people. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3249.9s)]
*  I know them. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3253.62s)]
*  Well, Keller was my foreign editor before he became executive editor. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3254.62s)]
*  No, they had a vested interest in the moment it was published in destroying Julian. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3259.06s)]
*  I want to talk about closing by independent media. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3265.94s)]
*  Independent media has always been the check on the commercial press that goes back to [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3268.82s)]
*  Ida B. Wells and before the great crusading journalists set up her newspaper in Memphis [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3276.7400000000002s)]
*  that exposed the reality of lynching, which was nothing about black men sexually assaulting [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3282.18s)]
*  white women. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3289.14s)]
*  But as she pointed out in her investigations, it was about destroying the black doctors, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3290.14s)]
*  black business owners to enforce the poverty and subjugation of a segregated South. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3297.62s)]
*  The ramparts you mentioned, Bob Scheer, again, ramparts never made a dime. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3311.02s)]
*  But it, Cointel Pro and that photograph of the child running down the road being burned [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3319.2599999999998s)]
*  by napalm in Vietnam and all of this comes out in the alternative press. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3324.98s)]
*  We used to have the Village Voice. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3331.46s)]
*  We used to have a decentralized press. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3335.5s)]
*  So there were far more alternative weeklys. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3337.9s)]
*  It's always been the independent media that has shamed or forced the commercial media [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3340.5s)]
*  to begrudgingly accept reality. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3346.34s)]
*  That's been transferred to the digital age and you hold up Consortium News and other [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3350.46s)]
*  sites that I respect run by Joe Luria, founded by Bob Perry, who I knew Bob because I covered [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3354.62s)]
*  the Contra War in Nicaragua. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3360.3s)]
*  And you're right that that is where the hope lies. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3366.5s)]
*  But I think the hope has always been within the alternative media. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3368.54s)]
*  And you worked for an alternative, you write about working for an alternative media publication [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3372.58s)]
*  which held these values. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3377.98s)]
*  It was called The Guardian, if I remember. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3378.98s)]
*  But we're watching it play itself out now in the digital age and we're watching the [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3386.14s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3391.98s)]
*  I think that's where we are. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3392.98s)]
*  I'm a little less hopeful than you are. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3393.98s)]
*  I'm hopeful about the quality of the independent media and what can come out. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3394.98s)]
*  But I think that the ferocity of the censorship is almost daily becoming more and more pronounced. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3397.58s)]
*  And I speak as somebody who's been deplatformed, demonetized, hit with algorithms and everything [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3403.58s)]
*  else. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3408.58s)]
*  Well, a couple of things that I've noticed in the past, and I think that's a good point, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3409.58s)]
*  is that the media is becoming more and more pronounced. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3412.58s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3416.18s)]
*  Well, a couple of points. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3417.18s)]
*  One, I think of, first of all, in the book I discard the term alternative media. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3422.18s)]
*  Way back in my youth I was foreign editor at The Guardian, the American Guardian, one [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3433.18s)]
*  of the wonderful experiments of 20th century journalism. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3443.18s)]
*  It lost its way in sectarian nonsense. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3448.7799999999997s)]
*  And my argument now is that independent media should not understand itself, nor should its [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3454.98s)]
*  readers and viewers, as an alternative to anything. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3465.98s)]
*  It should be an autonomous, freestanding set of institutions, publications, whatever, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3470.78s)]
*  broadcasters, that find their own way and they're not qualifying what they read in [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3480.38s)]
*  The New York Times the previous day. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3487.78s)]
*  I think that's an important point. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3489.5800000000004s)]
*  The independence in the true sense of the term. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3491.78s)]
*  The second point I want to make here is what we're talking about, the way you and I are [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3495.98s)]
*  talking right now, I don't know your technology intimately, but it is dependent on these extraordinary [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3500.98s)]
*  digital technologies. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3511.78s)]
*  That's terrific. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3514.6800000000003s)]
*  Look at the explosion in independent media. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3515.78s)]
*  You don't have to bother with newsprint anymore and all that sort of thing, right? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3521.78s)]
*  It's out there right away. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3527.38s)]
*  But this is the weighty paradox of our time. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3531.5800000000004s)]
*  What has made independent media so extraordinarily effective over a very long period of time? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3538.98s)]
*  And make no mistake, the corporate press is quite concerned about the challenge with [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3549.48s)]
*  which they've been presented. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3559.78s)]
*  But these same technologies leave us extremely vulnerable to being shut down, as you were [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3561.78s)]
*  saying, censored. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3571.48s)]
*  They can pull the plug, right? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3572.48s)]
*  My reply to this, and I don't wish to sound angelic or idealist, is think about the human [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3575.48s)]
*  commitment to renewed ideals evidenced in all the good people in independent media. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3589.48s)]
*  That's human intellectual commitment, career on the line sort of stuff. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3600.88s)]
*  You might destroy the technology. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3609.08s)]
*  Joe just got finished cleaning up this grotesque hack of the entire consortium's website. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3611.88s)]
*  You might do that, but you're not going to destroy the spirit and commitment of the people [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3622.08s)]
*  doing this work. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3628.8799999999997s)]
*  And that's where I draw a measure of optimism you may not share. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3630.8799999999997s)]
*  Whatever happens, we'll do this. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3640.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes, no, I share that. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3642.8799999999997s)]
*  I think the digital media has given us a kind of reach that normally dissidents such as [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3644.68s)]
*  ourselves wouldn't have, independent journalists. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3652.18s)]
*  I mean, remember, I.F. Stone began his weekly printing it off in his basement. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3654.68s)]
*  I thought it was his dining table. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3659.48s)]
*  Was it? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3661.48s)]
*  I thought maybe it was his dining table. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3662.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3664.48s)]
*  But look, it had, and he made the large journalistic institutions shake and quake because I think [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3665.48s)]
*  that circulation was never above 60,000, but it didn't matter. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3674.68s)]
*  It was who it reached. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3677.88s)]
*  Yeah, I love this detail. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3678.88s)]
*  Who told this story? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3681.98s)]
*  Wash Post reporters would be on the bus in D.C. with the Post in front of them and I.F. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3684.98s)]
*  Stone's weekly insides. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3692.18s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3694.98s)]
*  Great. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3695.98s)]
*  Fun. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3696.98s)]
*  That's great. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3697.98s)]
*  All right. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3698.98s)]
*  Well, thanks so much. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3699.98s)]
*  Pleasure. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3700.98s)]
*  Yeah, you were wonderful. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6GZX9QLiJk&t=3701.98s)]
