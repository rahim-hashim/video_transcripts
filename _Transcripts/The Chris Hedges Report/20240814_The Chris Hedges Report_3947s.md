# The Arab Jew Experience Exposes the Myths of Middle Eastern Antisemitism  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mhCEXpm1hA)
*  Welcome to the Chris Hedges Report.
*  At the age of five in 1950, Avi Shlaim, former Oxford professor in international relations
*  and one of the preeminent historians of the Middle East, was forced to leave Iraq where
*  his family's roots stretched back generations.
*  They fled to the new state of Israel, the once thriving Jewish community in Baghdad,
*  of which he and his family were a part, numbered some 130,000 people before the creation of
*  the Zionist state.
*  Today, it has all but vanished.
*  In his book Three Worlds, Memoirs of an Arab Jew, he evokes this lost world, one that was
*  often highly educated, cultured, multilingual, and lived in harmony with Sunnis, Shias, and
*  the newly formed nation of Iraq following the carving up of the Ottoman Empire in the
*  wake of World War I.
*  His narrative is at odds with the official Zionist narrative, which argues that anti-Semitism
*  is hardwired into Islam and that the Jews in the Arab world before the creation of the
*  state of Israel in 1948 were a persecuted minority that needed to be rescued and transported
*  to the new Jewish state.
*  The years 1950 and 51 marked a cataclysm for Iraqi Jews, Professor Schlamm writes.
*  In the space of just over a year, nearly the entire community left behind their ancient
*  homeland.
*  My family was among them.
*  Our comfortable lifestyle collapsed around a change I could not even dimly comprehend
*  as a child.
*  Ever since, I've been trying to make sense of what happened and why.
*  This exodus, he writes, became a rout after five bomb attacks on Jewish targets in Baghdad
*  between 1950 and 1951.
*  Who carried out these terrorist attacks in which Jews were injured and killed has been
*  debated for 75 years with two Israeli official commissions of inquiry.
*  Professor Schlamm's research based on interviews with those involved and Israeli documents
*  concludes that three of the five bombings were the work of the Zionist underground,
*  part of an effort to frighten Jews into leaving for Israel.
*  Once in Israel, Professor Schlamm and his family, because they were of Arab descent,
*  suffered discrimination from the European Jews who dominated Israeli political and cultural
*  life.
*  By delving into the history of my family in Iraq, I gained a better understanding of the
*  nature and global impact of Zionism.
*  Zionism was a settler colonial movement.
*  Looking back, it seems to me utterly indisputable that the creation of Israel involved a monumental
*  injustice to the Palestinians.
*  Three quarters of a million Palestinians, more than half the total, became refugees.
*  What the story of my family brought home to me, however, was that there was another category
*  of victims of the Zionist project, the Jews of the Arab lands.
*  Moreover, there was a link between the ways that the Zionist movement treated the Palestinian
*  Arabs and its treatment of the Arab Jews.
*  Both groups were a means to an end.
*  The construction of an exclusive Jewish national state in the heart of the Middle East, the
*  same colonial institutions that displaced the Palestinians, were tasked with absorbing
*  the Jewish immigrants from the Arab lands.
*  And the same arrogant, Eurocentric, Orientalist mindset greeted the Jewish newcomers from the
*  East.
*  Joining me to discuss his book, Three Worlds, Memoirs of an Arab Jew, is Professor Avi Schlamm.
*  So Avi, let's begin because you spend quite a bit of time in the book, which is just very
*  haunting, powerfully written, moving.
*  I mean, I just digested it almost all in one sitting.
*  You spend a lot of time in the book talking about reconstructing that life that your parents
*  had, your family had within Baghdad.
*  And it's completely at odds with, as I said in the introduction, the official Zionist
*  narrative.
*  So if you could just begin by explaining, and of course, you juxtapose that life with
*  the life you lead in Israel and the loss your father is destroyed by that being forced out
*  of Iraq.
*  But lay out for us what life was like for the Jewish community.
*  I think half of the roughly 260,000 Arab Jews who fled Israel came from Iraq.
*  So as you pointed out, my purpose in writing this book was to reanimate, to recreate a
*  unique Jewish civilization of the Near East, which has been blown away in the 20th century
*  by the cold winds of nationalism.
*  And my book is an attempt to interweave the personal story and the family story with a
*  story of the Jewish community in Iraq in the first half of the 20th century.
*  And as you pointed out, my account flatly contradicts the Zionist narrative, which says
*  was endemic perennial antisemitism throughout the Arab and the Islamic world.
*  And it was this deeply ingrained antisemitism that forced the Jews to leave the Arab world
*  and to come to the newly established state of Israel.
*  And in my book, I try and give an honest account of what life was like in Iraq before
*  I moved to Israel.
*  And one of the main points that emerged from my account is that there was a long tradition
*  of harmony, a long tradition of religious tolerance between the different minorities.
*  And in Iraq, there are many minorities.
*  There were Christians, there were Catholics, Cardenas, Tulkimans, Yazidis and Jews.
*  And the Jews didn't stand out in Iraq.
*  The Jews was one minority among many.
*  And there was a long tradition of coexistence between the different minorities.
*  So Iraq did not have a Jewish problem in inverted commas.
*  Europe had a Jewish problem.
*  In Europe, the Jews were the other.
*  Europe had a Jewish problem.
*  Adolf Hitler had what he thought was a solution to the Jewish problem.
*  Iraq did not have a Jewish problem.
*  Iraq had many minorities.
*  And Iraq was a pluralist society with coexistence.
*  The Zionist account dwells on the persecution and misery of the Jews in Iraq.
*  The experience of my family and the Jewish community was very, very different.
*  It was one of coexistence.
*  And for my family and me, Muslim-Jewish coexistence was not an abstract idea.
*  It wasn't a distant dream.
*  It was the everyday reality.
*  The real upheaval happened when Israel was created in 1948.
*  And as my mother said to me, when Israel was created, everything was turned upside down.
*  One of the fascinating points in your book is that there was in the 1930s the rise of
*  an anti-Semitic party.
*  But again, that was a European import.
*  This was fueled by German fascism.
*  That was a fascinating point.
*  Even the most virulent forms of anti-Semitism in Iraq were a European import.
*  There was no history of anti-Semitism in the Arab world.
*  Anti-Semitism is a European disease.
*  Anti-Semitism was born in Europe.
*  You can trace it back to the church in medieval times, which persecuted Jews because they
*  didn't accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God.
*  In the Middle East, in the Arab world, there wasn't a parallel tradition.
*  In the 1930s, anti-Semitism was exported from Europe to Iraq in particular.
*  And it's striking that there was no anti-Semitic literature in Arabic.
*  So anti-Semitic literature had to be translated from European languages into Arabic.
*  And one example is Adolf Hitler's mine camp.
*  The situation of the Jews in Iraq was very different to that of the Jews, say, in Europe.
*  In Iraq, the Jews did not live in ghettos.
*  In Iraq, the Jews practiced all the different professions.
*  It took Europe much longer than it took the Arab world to accept the Jews as equal citizens.
*  And we, my family and I, in the Jewish community, we had much more in common linguistically
*  and culturally with our Arab compatriots than we did with our European co-religionists.
*  So we were very much part of the fabric of Iraqi society.
*  We were not a foreign body.
*  There were thriving Jewish communities throughout the Arab world, in Lebanon, in Syria, in Iraq,
*  in Egypt, throughout North Africa.
*  But the Jewish community in Iraq was the most successful, the most prosperous, and also
*  the best integrated of all the Jewish communities.
*  And your family was quite prosperous.
*  Your father was quite a successful businessman.
*  So you grew up in privilege in Baghdad.
*  Indeed.
*  We were an upper middle class society.
*  We were very privileged.
*  My father was a very successful merchant.
*  We lived in a palatial house.
*  We had many servants.
*  My mother was a lady of leisure.
*  And it was a secure, comfortable, almost seborritic lifestyle.
*  A very comfortable lifestyle.
*  And we were indeed privileged.
*  And I don't claim that we were typical of the Jews in Iraq.
*  The Jews in Iraq belonged to all different classes, and there was also a large number
*  of very poor Jews in Iraq.
*  And there was a large middle class.
*  So I write about my own experience, and I make it clear that I do not generalize about
*  the rest of the Jewish community in Iraq.
*  I want to talk about Zionism as an ideology before we talk about the creation of the state
*  of Israel.
*  It did not have much support among the Jews in Iraq.
*  Zionism emphasized the historical connection of the Jewish people to its ancestral homeland
*  in the Middle East, but it spawned a state whose cultural and geopolitical orientation
*  identified it almost exclusively with the West.
*  Israel saw itself and was regarded by its enemies as an extension of European colonialism
*  in the Middle East, as being in the Middle East but not of it.
*  In this Eurocentric state, it was impossible for people like, write about your grandmother,
*  to feel at home.
*  But that was typical of most of the Iraqi Jews.
*  They did not identify as Zionists.
*  No.
*  Zionism was a European movement by European Jews for European Jews.
*  It did not really relate to the Jews of the East.
*  Indeed, the early Zionist leaders tended to look down on Arab Jews, on the Jews of the
*  East.
*  They tended to have an orientalist view of Arabs as being a backward and primitive people.
*  And the Jews of the Arab world were seen as not much better, slightly better, but not
*  much better, as being rather backward and uneducated.
*  And the Jewish, the Zionist leadership never paid much attention to the Jews of the Middle
*  East, until the Holocaust.
*  The Holocaust removed the main reservoir of people for the Jewish state to be.
*  And in the aftermath of the Holocaust, the Zionist leaders had to look for Jews from
*  wherever they could find them, from all corners of the earth, to bring them to the newly born
*  state of Israel.
*  And that included the Jews of the Arab lands.
*  I want to talk about that, but before I do, you write about Samuel Huntington's very
*  specious theory of the clash of civilizations, and how it implicitly rules out the possibility
*  of a Jewish Arab identity.
*  And this kind of clash of civilizations, you say, has been a major influence on the approach
*  of some Zionist historians to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
*  Can you just talk about that point a little bit before we get into what happened in Iraq?
*  Yes.
*  So after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Samuel Huntington, the Harvard professor,
*  propagated this notion of clash of civilizations.
*  And in it he argued that conflict after the fall of the Soviet Empire was no longer between
*  nation-states, but between civilizations, between cultures.
*  And it seems to me that some Americans always need to have an enemy.
*  During the Cold War, there was a clear enemy, the Soviet Union, and everything revolves
*  around the conflict between East and West.
*  And after the collapse of the Soviet Union, some Americans needed a new enemy, and Samuel
*  Huntington conjured up one, which is radical Islam.
*  So now the conflict became not between nation-states, but between the West and the rest, between
*  the West and radical Islam.
*  And interestingly, the original name for what became the global war on terror was the war
*  against global, sorry, the war against radical Islam.
*  This notion of clash of civilizations is really simplistic and superficial, and it will, I'll
*  go further, I'll say it's totally worthless.
*  And it most certainly doesn't apply to the history that I lived through.
*  My family was, my family and the Jewish community left Iraq not because of any cultural or religious
*  reasons or clash with the rest of Iraqi society.
*  My family, the drivers of our displacement was political, not ideological, not cultural.
*  So clash of civilizations has no relevance here, and yet this notion was picked up by
*  some right-wing Israeli writers, like Benny Morris, for example, who wrote a good book
*  on 1948, the first Arab-Israeli war.
*  And in the introduction he says that this was not a conventional geopolitical conflict.
*  In a broader sense, it was a conflict between Judeo-Christian civilization and Islam.
*  So I think this again is a complete misrepresentation of the reality.
*  This was a very traditional geopolitical conflict between Jews and Arabs over a piece of land.
*  To sum up, I think that clash of civilizations doesn't help us to understand the nature of
*  the Israeli-Arab conflict.
*  And the consequences, you use the term, you use the figure of 850,000 Jews from Arab countries,
*  so you're right and I'm wrong, I said 260.
*  The forced exodus of 850,000 Jews from Arab countries after 1948, you write, amounted
*  to a catastrophe, a Jewish Nakba, that refers to the Palestinian Nakba of 1948, with 750,000
*  Palestinians ethnically cleansed, at least on par with, if not more devastating in its
*  consequences than the Palestinian Nakba.
*  So why do you write, if not more devastating in its consequences?
*  Here is where I differ from the Zionist narrative.
*  The Zionist narrative says in 1948, the Arabs attacked the infant state of Israel, and in
*  the course of the war, three-quarters of a million Palestinians became refugees.
*  They weren't pushed out, they left off their own free will or on orders from above.
*  And at the same time, 850,000 Jews were driven out of the Arab world and ended up in Israel.
*  And they were forced out by anti-Semitism.
*  That was the driver of the displacement.
*  So what you have is a double exodus.
*  It's the theory of the double exodus, that in 1948 there was a Palestinian exodus from
*  Palestine and a Jewish exodus from the Arab world to Israel.
*  So in effect, there was a population exchange and Israel doesn't owe the Arabs or the Palestinians
*  anything.
*  This is a very popular theory in the Israeli right, and it's one that Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu is very fond of and repeats on every conceivable occasion.
*  This is the view that Israel is completely innocent, Israel was attacked, Israel is not
*  responsible in any way for the Palestinian refugee problem.
*  It's the Arabs who wronged the Jews and Israel offered safe haven to the Jews fleeing from
*  persecution.
*  So that's the view that is very popular in Israel and one that Netanyahu purveyes all
*  the time.
*  And as we speak, he's addressing a special session of both houses of Congress, and he's
*  and I suspect that he will be putting forward this Zionist view of the history of the conflict.
*  Let's talk a little bit about the process of pushing Jews in the Middle East into or
*  forcing them to flee from Iraq, and you did quite a bit of research.
*  There were five bombings, as I mentioned in their introduction, into finding out who was
*  responsible for those bombings, which turned the trickle of Jewish refugees from Iraq into
*  a stampede.
*  But talk about your research.
*  It's something that in the book you say has kind of obsessed you as a historian throughout
*  much of your career.
*  In 1950, there were 135,000 Jews in Iraq.
*  By the end of 1952, only about 10,000 were left and 125,000 Iraqi Jews ended up in Israel.
*  They arrived in Israel with one suitcase and 50 dinars.
*  They had lost everything.
*  And in 1951, five bombs exploded in Jewish premises in Baghdad.
*  And there were persistent rumors in Israel, I knew this from my family and my relatives,
*  that Israel had a hand in the bombs to force them to leave.
*  And this fueled Iraqi Jewish resentment against the state of Israel.
*  And I became obsessed with this question of who threw the bombs, not when I became a historian,
*  but when I was a child.
*  When I became a historian in 1982, when I spent a sabbatical year in the Israel State
*  Archives in Jerusalem, I ordered a file called Iraq 1950.
*  And I was told this file was closed.
*  I asked the state archivist, why is it closed?
*  Because more than 30 years have elapsed.
*  And he said to me, I'll check.
*  And the next day he said to me, because in this file there are some Mossad documents.
*  And I said, I thought, aha, there are Mossad documents.
*  That's why they're trying to hide the truth.
*  And I said to him, why don't you remove the Mossad documents and leave the foreign ministry
*  documents?
*  And he said, I'll check.
*  The following day he came back to me and he said, I'm sorry, the whole file is closed
*  and I cannot release any of the files.
*  And I thought to myself, it's possible that there is a snorting gun in this file, which
*  is why they don't want to release it.
*  But I'm a historian.
*  I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
*  So I suspended judgment until I started work on my autobiography.
*  And then I came through, I came across two sources of evidence which implicate Israel
*  in the bombings, in three out of the five bombs.
*  One source was Yaakov Kalkukli, an elderly Iraqi friend of my mother who was in the Zionist
*  out, he was an activist in the Zionist underground.
*  And he told me in great detail about their activities, about the bribes they paid, about
*  the documents they forged, about the action to accelerate, to enable first the illegal
*  migration from Iraq and then after 1950, the legal migration.
*  Because in 1950, the Iraqi passed a law that said any Iraqi Jew wants to leave, has a year
*  to register and they can leave the country.
*  And so he was one source and he said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
*  And he said to me that he had a colleague named Yousef Basri who was responsible for
*  three out of the five bombs.
*  And he told me that his controller, Basri's controller was an Israeli intelligence officer
*  called Max Binet who was based in Tehran because in those days the Shah's Iran had covert relations
*  with Israel.
*  So Max Binet was the controller of Basri who was responsible for the three bombs.
*  That's one source of evidence but we all know that there are pitfalls in oral evidence.
*  The other piece of evidence is an Iraq police report, one page that Kalkukli wrote about
*  and Kalkukli gave me which names Basri and his assistant Shalom Salah Shalom and it reports
*  what they said in the interrogation after they were captured.
*  So I now have both oral history and hard evidence which led me and I think that together they
*  make incontrovertible evidence that Israel had a hand in the bombs that were intended
*  to frighten the Jews and precipitate the exodus from Iraq to Israel.
*  And Binet ends up in Cairo also apparently overseeing terrorist activities against Western
*  targets during the regime of Nasser and commits suicide in a jail cell.
*  So this tactic was of terrorism, Zionist sponsored terrorism was not limited to Iraq.
*  This is a really crucial point that the bombings in the streets of Baghdad in 1950-51 were
*  not a one-off operation, it was a false flag operation but it was part of a pattern of
*  Zionist false flag operations in the Arab world.
*  And the other significant false flag operation is the one you just mentioned.
*  In Israel it's called the Mishap and the Mishap or the Lavon affair.
*  Pinchas Lavon was the Israeli defense minister in 1954 when a ring of Jewish, Egyptian spies
*  and saboteurs were caught red-handed when a bomb in a cinema exploded in the city of
*  Jerusalem.
*  It exploded prematurely creating smoke which led up to the rounding up of the whole ring.
*  And the purpose of this operation was to create bad blood between the newly established, newly
*  installed Nasser regime and the West.
*  To say to the West that the Nasser regime was unreliable, Britain had just signed an
*  agreement to withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and this was intended to force Britain
*  to remain in the Suez Canal zone.
*  So the leader of this ring was an old acquaintance, Max Binet.
*  He was caught and he committed suicide in an Egyptian prison.
*  He committed suicide after he heard that the Iraqi government had requested his extradition
*  to Iraq because of the things that he did in 1951.
*  So this is the conclusion that I draw that false flag operations are not wrong.
*  They are not one-off in Iraq but they are part of the Zionist strategy of dealing with
*  the Arab world.
*  And I'll make one other point.
*  This is a terrible thing to do, what Israel did in both instances.
*  It's to send an Israeli intelligence officer to recruit decent Iraqi Jews and to turn them
*  against their country, to turn them into spies and worst of all to turn them into terrorists.
*  So this is Israel sponsoring terrorism by Jews against other Jews in Arab countries.
*  It's a terrible indictment of Israel.
*  Well, we should also be clear that the Israeli Mossad or underground shipped all sorts of
*  weapons and explosives into Iraq and hid them in synagogues.
*  They did.
*  And after Basri and his assistant Shalom, Saleh Shalom, were caught, Shalom was the
*  one who handled the slicks.
*  So he took the Iraqi police to the synagogue where they had weapons and a transmitter
*  and to all the hiding points in all the Arab, in all the Jewish houses.
*  And it amounted to a very substantial lot of weapons, hand grenades and so the Israeli
*  Zionist movement was responsible for all this.
*  And you could justify it by saying that they're training local Jews for self-defense, but
*  you cannot possibly justify using these weapons, these hand grenades, the TNT for terrorist
*  operations to frighten the Jews.
*  My Zionist critics say some deny altogether, they say that I invented this story, that
*  Israel had no hand whatsoever in these bombings.
*  Others say, yes, they may have had a hand, but the exodus happened not because of the
*  bombs but because of anti-Semitism, because of official persecution of the Jews.
*  This is what drove the Jews out.
*  Now it's not part of my argument that the bombs were the critical factor in the exodus.
*  I accept that official persecution was the main reason for the exodus, but the bombs
*  were a factor.
*  They have to be taken into account.
*  And if I knew for certain that not a single Iraqi Jew left Iraq to Israel because of the
*  bombs, I would still say this operation, this four-flag operation is a terrible indictment
*  of the state of Israel because Israel was created to provide a safe haven for Jews fleeing
*  persecution.
*  Israel was not established in order to destabilize and frighten and create insecurity for the
*  Jews of the diaspora.
*  Although am I correct that after the bombings, the numbers of Iraqi Jews who decided to flee
*  to Israel increased exponentially?
*  Yes.
*  In March 1950, when the law was passed allowing the Jews to leave, only a few thousand chose
*  this option.
*  The majority preferred to stay.
*  And the exodus and then the number of Jews who registered to leave kept increasing.
*  And the bombs, you can correlate the bombs with the spike in the number of Jews who left.
*  But I emphasize it's not part of my argument that the bombs were the main reason for the
*  Jews leaving Iraq.
*  The process, the exodus was a complex process and there are many factors.
*  And this is one factor that I have highlighted and for which I have provided incontrovertible
*  evidence.
*  And we should be clear that after the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, many Arab governments
*  did begin to discriminate and persecute their Jewish minorities, branding them whether they
*  were Zionist supporters or not as kind of a fifth column within their own country.
*  Undoubtedly, indiscriminately this is so.
*  But the reason for the change also has something to do with Zionism.
*  Zionism gave the Jews a territorial dimension for the first time in two and a half millennia.
*  Zionism led to the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.
*  It achieved its principal goal.
*  There was now a Jewish state.
*  And for any Arab who didn't like Jews, this was an excuse to try and get rid of them.
*  In Iraq, there was the East Iklal party, which was a right-wing nationalist party which was
*  anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish, and it called for confiscating the property of Iraqi Jews and
*  for expelling them.
*  There were right-wing parties in other Arab countries.
*  What changed in 1948 is that there was a Jewish state.
*  And anyone, any Arab who didn't like Jews could now say, turn to the Jews and say, you
*  don't belong here.
*  You are not from here.
*  You are foreigners.
*  You are outsiders.
*  You are the brothers of the Zionists who have displaced our Palestinian brothers.
*  So it became easier for any anti-Semites now to turn into the Jews.
*  And the Jews in Iraq who had been a positive element in Iraqi society, a very positive
*  element in nation-building since the First World War, now were seen increasingly as a
*  fifth column.
*  Just before we get into your experience once you migrate to Israel, you write, for Israel
*  the operation, we're talking about the operation of pushing the Jews to Israel, yielded apart
*  from its human cargo hundreds of thousands of pounds in hard currency.
*  This operation was also very profitable for the Zionists.
*  It was profitable because the law that allowed Jews to leave the country allowed them to
*  leave with only 50 dinars.
*  When they arrived in Israel, they arrived with 125,000 of them.
*  So multiply 125,000 by 50 dinars.
*  This is in 1950-51 when Israel was very short of hard currency.
*  And this was a major source of hard currency.
*  And also the Iraqi Jews were given the official rate of exchange, which was not a favorable
*  rate.
*  So yes, Israel did make quite a lot of, gained quite a lot in hard currency as a result of
*  the arrival of the Iraqi Jews.
*  We should also note your mother who comes across as kind of a force of nature throughout
*  the whole book, manages to smuggle out her diamonds along with I think six oriental carpets.
*  Your situation, you're in a hotel in Cyprus for a month.
*  Your father is left behind, has to flee across the border, finally at great risk to Iran,
*  doesn't join you for a year.
*  Let's talk about what life was like for Arab Jews in the Zionist state.
*  It was quite a bitter experience for you, although when you become an adolescent, you're
*  attracted to Herut, the very right-wing Menachem Begin party.
*  But let's talk about what it was, the effect that it had on you and your family being in
*  a state that was dominated by European Jews.
*  As I said earlier, my family was very privileged.
*  We were very wealthy.
*  And also, my mother had British citizenship because her father was an interpreter for
*  the British consulate in Baghdad.
*  So, in June 1950, my mother, my grandmother, and my two sisters and I left Baghdad on a
*  regular flight to Nicosia in Cyprus.
*  And from there, we went by boat to Haifa.
*  And once we arrived in Israel, we didn't go like the rest of Iraqi Jews into transit camps.
*  We went to live with my mother's uncle in Ramadgan.
*  In a very large house.
*  So I and my family didn't suffer as much as the great majority of ordinary Iraqi Jews
*  because when they arrived in Israel, they were sprayed with DDT.
*  Just try to imagine the impact that this would have on a Jewish family.
*  Just try to imagine the impact that this would have on a Jew who arrived in the promised
*  land and he's treated like an animal and sprayed with pesticide.
*  And from the airport, these Jews were taken to transit camps, to Mar Barot.
*  And the conditions in the Mar Barot were very, very dire.
*  There were tents, there were shacks, sanitation was very poor.
*  The food was inadequate and of very poor quality.
*  But most of all, there was the cultural shock of arriving in a new country with a different language.
*  And the managers of the Mar Barot were all Ashkenazi Jews.
*  They didn't have a clue about who these newcomers were.
*  They had no idea of the status, the qualifications, the achievements in Iraq.
*  They thought that these people, instead of complaining, should be grateful for everything that was done for them.
*  So this was a very shaky start for the Iraqi Jews in Israel.
*  Well, you make the point in the book that oftentimes the Arab Jews, especially the women, were far better educated than the Ashkenazi or European Jews who looked down on them.
*  You write, you're writing about the Zionist leadership.
*  They simply had no understanding of the customs, culture or aspirations of Iraqi Jews.
*  They thought of them as backward and primitive and expected them to take their place at the bottom of the social hierarchy and be grateful for whatever they were given.
*  The olim came from nine different Arab countries, but for the transit camp managers, they were all the same.
*  And then you write, the Israeli establishment was bent on suppressing the Arab culture and erasing the identity of Oriental Jews by forcing them into a U.S.
*  The European Ashkenazi melting pot, David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister, referred to the immigrants of the East as savage hordes and Abba Eban, who I knew, stated that the goal must be to instill in them a Western spirit and not let them drag us into an unnatural orient.
*  This Orientalism was rampant and you experience this in school, although you end up finally being a Muslim.
*  You were a scholar at the University of Cambridge in England and a noted scholar.
*  That didn't color your early experiences where there was open hostility to you as an Iraqi Jew.
*  Indeed. And as a boy, I had a sense of inferiority because I was an Iraqi boy.
*  It's Hark Bar Moshe, a distant relative of mine, was wrote many books.
*  And one of them was about the departure from Iraq about this period.
*  And he says, we left Iraq as Jews and we arrived in Israel as Iraqis.
*  And this was true for me and my family.
*  In Israel, we felt out of place.
*  We felt that we didn't belong.
*  My father never really mastered the Hebrew language.
*  And Aliyah, immigration to Israel is described as Aliyah, which literally means ascent.
*  So you are sent to Israel.
*  But in our experience, the move from Iraq to Israel was a steep Yerida,
*  a steep descent from a high status in Iraq to the margins of Israeli society.
*  So, yes, there was this Orientalist attitude towards the Israeli society.
*  There was this Orientalist attitude on the part of the Israeli leadership.
*  And there was really no getting away from that.
*  My sense of inferiority governed my relationship with Israeli society.
*  And it's only many years later that I began to make sense of my life in Israel
*  and why I did so badly at school.
*  And one thing that I learned as a scholar and didn't understand as a schoolboy
*  was that the Ashkenazi elite has also, where it pursued a system of
*  de-Arabization of the Arab Jews.
*  The whole educational system was geared to de-Arabization of the Jews
*  from the Arab countries and turning them into new Israelis.
*  But part of that was the erasing of our history.
*  And that was the first step in the process of the Arab Jewish system.
*  Erasing of our history.
*  So Jewish history is the history of the Jews in Europe.
*  And the American Jewish historian, Salo Barron, coined the phrase
*  the lacrimos phrase, the lacrimos version of Jewish history.
*  That is to say, Jewish history is a never-ending cycle of persecution,
*  discrimination, violence and hostility culminating in the Holocaust.
*  This may apply, although I would dispute that it does, to the history of the Jews in Europe.
*  But it most emphatically doesn't apply to our history in Iraq.
*  So one of the things that I wanted to achieve in this book is to rewrite
*  our history in Iraq as I experienced it and as my family experienced it
*  rather than to allow the Zionist historian to substune history,
*  our history, under the lacrimos version of Jewish history.
*  Let's talk about your attraction to Herut, Menachem Begin,
*  who carried out terrorist activities in the lead-up to the Israeli state
*  against the British and against the Palestinians,
*  as well as your national service in the Israeli Defense Force,
*  which both of those two experiences have been very interesting.
*  And those experiences push you very close to embracing
*  the Zionist narrative.
*  But let's begin with Begin, because he was certainly no friend of the Arab world.
*  I mean, he had a great strain of racism within Herut.
*  And yet, as somebody within, and Mapai was the ruling
*  labor party, but it was European-dominated.
*  But talk about that attraction to the far right and then your experiences in the IDF.
*  So, yes, let's begin with Begin, who was an extreme
*  right-wing nationalist. And he had
*  nothing to offer Oriental Jews on the
*  socioeconomic front, because he supported capitalism
*  and his domestic agenda did not appeal
*  or should not have appealed to poor, impoverished
*  Oriental Jews. What he did have was
*  nationalism. And also, he was a spellbinding
*  orator. And the way he addressed
*  me and the crowds in the main square in
*  Ramadgan who came to hear him was he said to us,
*  we are brothers, we are equal, we are all patriotic Israelis.
*  What we are up against is the
*  Mapai elite, the labor elite. It's they who
*  look down on you. I don't look down on you. So he played on our
*  sense of alienation and he exploited the arrogance
*  of the Mapai elite. And that's how he reached us.
*  And Oriental Jews, because we were
*  outsiders, had a tendency to want to belong.
*  We wanted to establish our nationalist credentials. That's why
*  we were attracted to Menachem Begin and his brand of
*  Zionism. Very similar to Trump. Many of
*  dispossessed people feeling that he expresses their grievances
*  even though, of course, it's
*  kind of root to their own enslavement. And let's talk about the
*  IDF. And you talk about the Six Day Wars being kind of the height of your
*  you make a very good point, by the way, in the book about the difference between patriotism and
*  nationalism. That nationalism needs enemies. That's what defines nationalism. But let's talk about your
*  experience in the IDF and its effect on you.
*  I was inducted into the
*  IDF when I was 18.
*  And that was the height of my
*  identification with Zionism and the state of Israel.
*  There is
*  extensive academic literature on nationalism.
*  In particular, there is Benedict Anderson's
*  book on imagined communities. But I
*  felt nationalism in my bones as a boy.
*  I knew what it means.
*  The induction ceremony was on the
*  Judean hills in the twilight when there was a
*  fusillade which illuminated the sky and we all shouted in unison,
*  in blood and fire, Judea fell. In blood and fire,
*  Judea will rise again. And I remember having a distinct
*  sense that we were a small, peace-loving country
*  surrounded by Arab predators who wanted to throw us into the
*  sea. And I had a deep belief in the justice of our cause. And like
*  all of my colleagues, we were
*  really nationalists. We were prepared to
*  defend and to die for our country.
*  But that was the high point of my identification with the Zionist
*  project. When the Six-Day War broke out in June 1967,
*  I was a history student at Cambridge. And
*  my disenchantment with Israel
*  began slowly from that period onwards. Because
*  the Six-Day War was a turning point in the history of the Middle East, but it was
*  also a turning point in my personal history. Because I had served
*  in the mid-1960s proudly and loyally in the IDF
*  because I thought at that time that it was true to its name. It was the
*  Israel Defense Forces. But after the victory
*  in 1967, Israel traveled its territory. It captured the
*  Golan Heights, the West Bank, and Sinai.
*  And Israel became a fully-fledged colonial power. And the IDF
*  was transformed from a regular army into the
*  brutal police force of a brutal colonial
*  empire. So that's the beginning of a long process of disenchantment
*  with Israel and Zionism.
*  I want to close you right towards the end of the book. Israel never saw itself
*  as part of the Middle East. Nor did it want to integrate into the regional environment.
*  Oriental Jews with their knowledge of Arabic and first-hand experience of living in
*  Arab countries could have served as a bridge between Israel and its neighbors.
*  The Ashkenazi establishment, however, had no interest in building such a
*  bridge. Under the leadership of David Ben-Gurion, it built Israel as a fortress
*  state with a siege mentality that attributed genocidal intentions to
*  its neighbors. It saw Israel as part of the West. And it used the
*  special relationship with the United States not to resolve its conflict with the Palestinians,
*  but to prolong and entrench its control over the occupied
*  territories. And of course, now we have the genocide
*  in Gaza.
*  The founding fathers of Israel never thought of Israel as part of the Middle East.
*  Ze'ev Jobotinsky portrayed the Jewish state
*  as holding the wall between
*  Europe and Eastern barbarism. Theodore Herzl,
*  the visionary of the Jewish state, also regarded the Jewish state
*  as part of Europe, culturally, spiritually.
*  David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister, once said,
*  It's only as a result of a geographical accident that we find ourselves in the Middle East.
*  Our values and our culture makes us part of the West.
*  And Israel's geopolitical orientation has always been
*  to be part of the West. Israel, from Ben-Gurion
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  Israel has always resisted integration into
*  the region. And Netanyahu is an
*  extreme example of an Islamophobe, of someone
*  who hates Arabs, as someone who
*  doesn't want to have anything to do with the Arab world, who believes
*  only in Israeli domination over the Palestinians and over the Arabs.
*  And I naively used to hope that the
*  Mizrahi, the Arab Jews, could serve as a
*  bridge between Israel and its neighbors. But as I
*  wrote in my book, Israel's Ashkenazi leadership
*  was not interested in building bridges. It was only interested
*  in Israeli hegemony and domination. So the
*  Arab Jews never served as a bridge,
*  but that is not to say that they are not capable
*  of serving as a bridge. And in my book, in the
*  epilogue, I say that my own experience of living among Arabs
*  encourages me to believe that this polarization,
*  this division that Israel has brought about is not inevitable,
*  that something that happened in the past that I hope
*  would still be, my experience enables me to think outside
*  the box, to think of a better future for our region
*  than the present dismal state when Israel
*  is conducting a war against the Palestinians
*  and is perpetrating genocide in Gaza. I still
*  believe that a better future is possible and it should be
*  a future that reverts to the past, to the cosmopolitanism,
*  to the pluralism and to the coexistence between
*  Muslims and Jews that used to exist before the state of Israel was
*  established. You write at the end of the book, the outcome
*  I have come to favor is one democratic state between
*  the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea with equal rights for all its
*  citizens, regardless of ethnicity or religion, this is the
*  democratic one state solution, which
*  you have, you've had students on university campuses in the United
*  States who have been arrested
*  for using that term, the river to the sea, but you don't embrace
*  as I do not, the two state solution and you hold out this one person,
*  one vote, this democratic state. I used to support the two state
*  solution, but Israel has killed it. Israel has killed the two state
*  solution with settlements, ever expanding settlements by the
*  annexation of East Jerusalem by building the security wall on the
*  West Bank that effectively annexes a large chunk of
*  the West Bank to Israel. So what is left
*  is Arab Palestinian enclaves on the West Bank
*  surrounded by the Israeli settlements and military bases. That's not
*  a basis for a viable state. It's become
*  fashionable to say that the two state solution is dead. I would say
*  that the two state solution was never born because no Israeli
*  government since 1967 has offered a formula for a two state
*  solution that would be acceptable to the most moderate Palestinians.
*  And secondly, no American administration has ever pushed Israel
*  towards the two state solution. That's why I've moved towards adopting
*  the one state solution as the only
*  democratic solution. And our students in
*  Oxford have used the slogan from the river to the
*  sea. I've supported them all along against the
*  university authorities who called the police and disbanded them.
*  The students gave me a T-shirt with the university logo
*  that says from the river to the sea. In America you may be arrested
*  for this slogan, but what it means to me
*  is not the dismantlement of the
*  what it means to me is equal rights for all
*  those who live between the river and the sea.
*  Equal rights, that's essential, an essential element of democracy
*  and also freedom for all
*  from the river to the sea. This is the exact opposite of the present
*  situation when Israel has an apartheid regime
*  over the whole of mandatory Palestine and the Israeli
*  government is increasingly overtly racist and the
*  Israeli government today rejects the one state solution
*  and it's a Jewish supremacist
*  and an apartheid state and this situation is completely unacceptable
*  to me. That's why I uphold the noble vision of one state
*  with equal rights for all its citizens.
