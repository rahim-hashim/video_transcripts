# The Fall of Assad & What it Means for The Mid East (w Alastair Crooke)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgEgHVtRbg4)
*  The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, ending a 53-year dynasty begun by his father,
*  dramatically shifts the pieces on the chessboard of the Middle East.
*  The rebel group Hayat, Tahrir, al-Sham, or HTS led by Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, is armed
*  and backed by Turkey and was once allied with al-Qaeda.
*  It is sanctioned as a terrorist group.
*  Turkey's primary goal is to prevent an independent Kurdish state in northern Syria where Kurds
*  have formed an autonomous enclave.
*  But it may not only be Turkey that is behind the overthrow of Assad.
*  It may also be Israel.
*  Israel has long sought to topple the Syrian regime which is the transit point for weapons
*  from Iran to the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah.
*  The Syrian regime was backed by Russia and Iran.
*  Indeed, Russian warplanes routinely bombed Syrian rebel targets and Russian troops were
*  stationed in Syria.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has gloated about the ousting of Assad, calling
*  it an historic day and said it was a direct result of Israel's actions against Hezbollah
*  and Iran.
*  But at the same time, Israel will most likely soon have an Islamic state on its border.
*  Syria, a country of 23 million, is geopolitically important.
*  It links Iraq's oil to the Mediterranean, the Shia of Iraq and Iran to Lebanon, and
*  Turkey, a NATO ally, to Jordan's deserts.
*  Assad's decision to brutally crush a pro-democracy movement triggered a 14-year-long civil war
*  in 2011 that led to 500,000 people being killed and more than 14 million displaced.
*  Now what?
*  Will Hayat, Tahrir, Al-Sham seek to renew relations with Iran?
*  Will it impose an Islamic state?
*  Will Syria's many minority groups, Alawite, Druze, Armenian, Chechen, Assyrian, Christian
*  and Turkmen, be persecuted, especially the Alawites, a heterodox offshoot of Shiite Islam
*  comprising around 10% of the population, which Assad and the ruling elites were members
*  of?
*  How will it affect the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which hold the Syrian
*  oil-rich territory in north and east Syria?
*  Why are the U.S. and Israel bombing targets in Syria following the oust of Assad?
*  Will the new regime be able to convince the U.S. and Europe to lift sanctions and return
*  the occupied oil?
*  What does this portend for the wider Middle East, especially in Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied
*  territories?
*  Joining me to discuss the overthrow of the Assad regime and its ramifications is Alastair
*  Crook, a former British diplomat with more than 30 years' service in the Middle East.
*  He worked as a security adviser to the EU special envoy to the Middle East, as well
*  as helping lead numerous efforts to set up negotiations and truces between Hamas, Islamic
*  Jihad and other Palestinian resistance groups with Israel.
*  He was especially instrumental in establishing the 2002 ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.
*  He is also the author of Resistance, the Essence of the Islamist Revolution, which analyzes
*  the ascendancy of Islamic movements in the Middle East.
*  Let's put everything in context.
*  Let's go back to the Arab Spring.
*  Alastair, there were widespread demonstrations in Syria, as there were throughout the Arab
*  world.
*  These were crushed very, very brutally by the Assad regime, which triggered the civil
*  war.
*  Let's start there.
*  Okay.
*  With the Arab Spring, Spain, ready its roots, if you want to go back to the roots of that
*  whole process.
*  The Arab Spring was a meeting that took place with then Vice President Dick Cheney after
*  the war in Lebanon, the 2006 war in Lebanon.
*  It entailed Prince Bandar, who was then head of Saudi intelligence services.
*  What happened at that meeting was that Cheney started moaning and saying, look, what's going
*  on?
*  The invasion of Iraq was supposed to weaken Iran.
*  It doesn't seem to have done that.
*  Now we've got Hezbollah, who emerged victorious from this war in Lebanon.
*  Prince Bandar interrupted at that point.
*  He said, no, the king believes that the solution to this is we've got to take out Syria.
*  Syria is the weak link in this whole process.
*  Cheney sort of backed off.
*  He said, well, what do you have in mind?
*  What are you talking about?
*  And he said, well, there's a solution.
*  It is, if you like, Islamic revolutionaries, the other ones that can work for you.
*  And again, Cheney sort of backed away a little, said, well, you know, the United States can't
*  do too much about that.
*  You know, we wouldn't want to go too far in that.
*  And Bandar said, no problem.
*  We will do it all for you.
*  It'll be done.
*  You don't have to intervene.
*  It will follow.
*  And so this was a sort of second round.
*  The first round happened in Afghanistan long before when I was there, when, of course,
*  Saudi Arabia, at the behest of the United States, sent Islamist movements into what
*  was the secular society in Afghanistan in order to bring it down to damage Russia and
*  to weaken Russia at the point.
*  And so this came up at this point.
*  But you have to grasp the big geopolitical picture of what was happening.
*  Saudi Arabia was proposing to invert the whole paradigm of the Middle East in the 19th
*  century and beyond.
*  It was Iran, the Shah.
*  This was, it was a big, powerful country, and it was the leader in the Middle East.
*  And what he was saying is, let's invert it.
*  Let's isolate Iran and make the Sunnis paramount in the Middle East, give them the
*  primacy.
*  And so it was an attempt to sort of shift the whole balance around in a different way
*  and to give the Sunni world.
*  And this had been part of America's policy from 96 onwards, 1996, this idea of working
*  with the Gulf states and with the monarchs and emirs of the Gulf against, then it was
*  against Baathist regime and others, but then it was against Iran.
*  And I remember, I mean, I was writing, you asked about the Arab awakening and what happened
*  at that point.
*  Well, it was, I think, really in about 2015 or earlier, I'm not sure if 12 or 13 even,
*  that Obama signed the presidential finding, which is an order.
*  I mean, it's an order that is given and was given to the CIA to oust Assad and to overturn
*  the government there.
*  And so, ever since then, there have been a whole series of sort of three letter, a whole
*  rag tag of three letter groups that have received American training, Israeli training, Turkish
*  training in Syria, mainly for the purpose of ousting Assad and fulfilling the finding,
*  Obama's presidential finding.
*  But even this started to fail in my view.
*  I wrote, I remember, and I think it was around 2012, I wrote and I said, things are shifting
*  because what I see is this, we used to look at Palestine and we used to look at the Middle
*  East through sort of secular eyes, albeit orientalist eyes, but through secular eyes
*  we used to lose it and see it in sort of instrumental fashion.
*  Palestine, you know, it was about institution, construction to state solution.
*  And I wrote even then that I thought this was shifting towards, if you like, symbols
*  of religion.
*  Al-Aqsa versus Temple Mount were going to be the new wall that was coming.
*  And gradually, if you like, the Saudis wore out their interests in Wahhabism, Wahhabism
*  an extreme form of very narrow religion, of Islamic religion based on texts and on document,
*  which was known quite obviously as the management of savagery.
*  And this was the turning point really.
*  I think it was starting to shift in the other direction and now Saudi Arabia has almost
*  completely got rid of, if you like, the Wahhabi influence.
*  Other parts of the Gulf have become more, what I call, more interested in Bloomberg
*  and their stock market ratings than they are in the geopolitics of the region.
*  So that is the shift.
*  Now what's happened essentially with this is an expansion of Obama's finding because
*  gradually the most severe sanctions, the Caesar sanctions were imposed on Syria from the
*  beginning.
*  And then the Kurds were empowered in the northeast of Syria and they sat on the Syrian oil field
*  and that oil was taken from them and sent Turkey and it was entirely an illegal operation.
*  So Syria lost its oil revenues and then later the Turks came down into the western part
*  of Syria, occupied Idlib and took Aleppo.
*  That was the industrial part.
*  So the agricultural, the oil industry, there was no economy, no economy left.
*  Just to give you a practical example now where we've seen that the Syrian army sort of were
*  inclined to fight, a conscript in the Syrian army is currently paid $7 a month.
*  A general in the Syrian army receives $40 per month.
*  The HTS and the others of the militia receive $2,000 a month.
*  That is the state in which, I mean, that really Syria just didn't have for one thing the
*  resources to seemingly be able to put together an army or fight.
*  Russia tried to do this in 2018.
*  It said to Assad, we'll remake your army, re-equip it, new equipment, we'll train them
*  the latest things on credit.
*  You don't have to put money up.
*  Assad said no.
*  Then more lately the Iranians have said to them, you know, we can support you.
*  We can support your army.
*  We can help, but you have to invite us.
*  I mean, we can't come in as an occupying force.
*  We have to be invited.
*  Assad said no.
*  And throughout this period he has been warned that something was coming.
*  The Iranians, the Quds Brigade of the IRGC, about two months ago went to Assad and they
*  said to him, something is happening in Idlib.
*  Beware.
*  Watch out.
*  And I imagine that the Russians were equally aware of this.
*  And the Turks have now publicly said, you know, that this was on the cards.
*  They were operating this six months earlier.
*  They had started from their perspective six months earlier.
*  I would actually put the date for the preparation of this for two years ago probably.
*  But anyway, they openly say six months ago, you know, it was underway being prepared and
*  being prepared obviously with America and being prepared with Israel.
*  Now why did he say no?
*  Now I don't have an answer that is definitive of this.
*  But I remember some years ago, I remember well that I had, there was a discussion and
*  I know the details of it, that when MBS, Mohammed bin Salman, was sort of new on the stage and
*  young, Mbz from the Crown Prince of UAE were talking and he said, listen to Mohammed bin
*  Salman, if you want to be Crown Prince, the path to be Crown Prince is through Israel.
*  And it's through the Israeli lobby in Washington.
*  That's what you need to do.
*  And that's of course what UAE had done already with its base in Washington and presenting
*  itself in ways to America.
*  And I think what we've seen in the last three or four years is we've seen actually that
*  both that Assad was distancing himself from both Iran and from Russia.
*  And I think that he was being pulled more and more by the Gulf States, thinking that
*  if he approximated closer to the Gulf States and away from Iran and Russia, this was his
*  path to sort of survival because Washington would like that. But more importantly, Tel
*  Aviv would like that and that would work with him in that way.
*  Well, in the end, it just, there was nothing left to work with. So anyone who had a political
*  strategy, I think, had been for months, months, years trying to persuade Assad to allow his
*  government to be, if you like, I can only describe it as a sort of controlled Ottoman
*  structure rather than a government of the Syrian people.
*  And I remember he was pressing it very hard at one time when I was with Assad in Damascus.
*  And I said, look, these people like Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood who are guests
*  in my country, we've helped, funded, supported them, now telling me how to run the country
*  and that they want the Muslim Brotherhood. And it's a very sensitive issue, the Muslim
*  Brotherhood in Syria, I'm sure, because of the affairs with Hamas.
*  Well, we should just explain for people who don't know, there was an uprising, I think
*  his father, Hafez al-Assad, at least 10th, he raised the city, 10,000 dead. You can explain
*  the context of that. And it was a Ba'athist secular regime, Ba'athism coming out of Nasser,
*  Saddam Hussein was a Ba'athist. But just explain, going back that history, why they were so
*  terrified of the Muslim Brotherhood as, of course, was other rulers like King Hussein.
*  They saw the Muslim Brotherhood as a very strict Islamist movement whose tale, and there
*  is some truth to this, veered off into sort of Wahhabism and Salafism. That was certainly
*  true in Gaza and elsewhere. But Erdogan tried to take control of the Muslim Brotherhood
*  because he wanted to present, as I've just said, that whereas Cheney was empowering the
*  kings and emirs of Sunni Islam to be the masters of the world, Erdogan wanted to go back to
*  Ottomanism, a form of neo-Ottomanism. And everyone feared that. No one liked the Ottomans, basically
*  outside of Ottoman wealth. And he wanted to insert that. And Assad saw this as a huge
*  danger and that this was going to be a militant attack on the state. But during that period
*  after this, the state has become weaker and weaker and weaker. And so when, if you like,
*  when Russia said, well, we can try and build up your army and try and make you stronger,
*  I don't think he had the resources. I don't think he had even, when you're paying your
*  troops $7 a month, you just don't have many resources. The people were starving, they
*  were losing hope, and there was a lot of corruption. You can imagine soldiers on $7 a month, you
*  know, stop the people at the checkpoints and demand money from them. That sort of thing
*  was going on. And then he was being dragged towards the Gulf states thinking this might
*  be a solution for him. And then Erdogan decided to mount, if you like, this coup d'etat,
*  through Idlib using a motley group of militias and others and those that are loosely tied
*  to ISIS or al-Qaeda. And I think that what happened was because he went to see President
*  Putin on the day before, Friday, I think it started Saturday, and he spent some time with
*  President Putin, hours, and then flew back the same day. And we have no idea what was
*  said at that meeting. There's no record of it from the Kremlin side and there's no record
*  on the Damascus side of it. But I think that was probably the point Putin said, I'm sorry,
*  Assad, it's game over. There's going to be a change and you're going to have to work
*  with it. So I think from the Astana, from the meetings between Iran, Turkey, and Russia,
*  Russia had come to the conclusion on two grounds. First of all, this was going to be a terrible
*  mess if Assad fell. And I think he was probably being advised that this is almost inevitable
*  outcome and the situation was becoming irreversible. So I think in one sense he could see that
*  this would be a terrible mess, yes. But at the same time he recalled Afghanistan and
*  the same time he knew that one of the plans that is in hand against Russia is to weaken
*  it, to give ways of pulling it from its focus on Ukraine and the war there, to create new
*  fronts, new pressure points, more pressure on Assad. And that he decided, you know, what
*  is the primary interest of Russia? The primary interest is not the small wars, the big war.
*  Not Romania, not Belarus, not Montevideo, but the big war, which is against, if you
*  like, NATO and the West, which wants to, if you like, peel him away from China, peel him
*  away from Iran, scatter the bricks across the globe and leave Russia isolated. And so
*  I guess he decided that that was to be the case. And Iran were very clear. They went,
*  Larry Jani went to see Assad well before the actual collapse and said, you know, to say
*  look, it's coming, it's coming, you're going to go. I mean, there's no way the army is
*  going to protect. And I think, I know Larry Jani, he wouldn't even see him. And then he
*  told him he was wrong. And I just think that at that point it was all over. And so Russia
*  and Iran and Iran got together and they produced this document. Of course, I mean, you know,
*  it's all diplomatic speak. It doesn't, it has got no real meaning. It talks about elections
*  and a ceasefire and everyone is going to stop and get together and come and the legitimate
*  opposition must be included and HTS excluded. I mean, all this is fiction. Of course, it's
*  never going to happen. I mean, indeed.
*  Let me ask a little bit about what this, let's start with Turkey. I mean, I hadn't heard
*  that figure of $2,000 a month. That's a lot of money in the Middle East. Is that Turkish
*  money? Is that Israeli money? Is that US money? I just want to talk about the US, Turkey and
*  Israel independently. And then of course we have to acknowledge, I think you would agree,
*  this is quite a blow to both Russia and Iran, in particular Hezbollah. It's the lifeline
*  to Hezbollah.
*  Of course. Of course.
*  But let's start with Turkey. It was Turkey. Where did the arms and money come from? Was
*  it primarily Turkey?
*  Most of the training, I mean, there's been a lot of training of these groups even across
*  from sort of Central Asia, Uzbeks, Turkomans and others, former jihadists, former fighters,
*  al-Qaeda fighters have been taken in. And indeed, if you look at Jirami's group, you
*  know, this polyglot group of militia, more than 30% actually come from Central Asia.
*  They're not Syrians at all. So they've been brought in. And Turkey is well known to have
*  a training center for these groups, even allegations that the famous fire at a concert hall in
*  Moscow last year, earlier this year, that many people died in. They were Turkans and
*  that they came from, that they were trained in Turkey. So there's been a long process
*  of this. And yes, it's funded by America because it's part of the process. He sold it to America
*  as part of the process of getting rid of Assad and getting a Western friendly government
*  installed in Damascus. Of course, he framed it as a Western friendly government, what
*  he meant was a sort of neo-Ottoman-esque government in Damascus. And as I said, I know that I
*  said that because, you know, Assad was telling me at that earlier point, you know, how much
*  pressure was on him to sort of bring in sort of parts of the Ottoman world into his government
*  and he refused. And that was the cause of the breakup originally. So yes, money coming
*  in, Turkey working closely with America, particularly in the groups in the South, which were operated
*  more, it was complicated in Syria because the Pentagon was training some and CIA training
*  others in Syria at the same time. And some of those groups were fighting each other,
*  even though they were both on the American payroll. So America was funding a lot of this
*  for Turkey. It was seeing Turkey as someone who could be helpful to Israel. And Turkey
*  was very supportive of Israel and things only started to sort of go wrong, I think around
*  2016 when Turkey said that there's been this plot against him, a coup, you know, a coup
*  and that he blamed it was an American coup attempt to get rid of him. And at that point
*  he's become much more militant. His ego is huge. He made a statement yesterday. I saw
*  it this morning. He was sitting there and he said, there are really only two leaders
*  in the world today, myself and Putin, but I've been around a lot longer than Putin. So, you
*  know, you can judge what, you know, how recently Syria, something for him to take, but I think
*  the great weakness and the flaw of this whole construct that has taken place and allowed
*  to be taking place is he claims and thinks he can control Jirani and the jihadists now
*  posing as ex-jihadists and diverse characters have embraced diversity and inclusion and
*  whatever else. And he thinks that he can control and even his own people say, and they've said
*  it clearly in the press too, he doesn't control these people. He controls a few of them, but
*  he doesn't control them. And he certainly doesn't control Jirani who set up a very oppressive
*  structure in Idlib while he was the boss there. Very oppressive, strict, and anyone
*  who disagreed disappeared.
*  Let's talk about Israel because Netanyahu has gloated about this. In the short term,
*  it does seem to benefit Israel in the sense that, as we said before, Syria is the transit
*  point for weapons and aid to Hezbollah. Hezbollah troops were fighting for Assad. They withdrew
*  just before the fall of Assad. Israel has moved forward in the buffer zone on the Golan
*  Heights. They've moved tanks. This has occupied Syrian territory. So just as in Lebanon, they've
*  used this moment to seize more land. Israel, like the US, has bombed supposedly weapons
*  facilities, intelligence facilities in Syria. But I have this question I have to ask you.
*  I don't see how an Islamic state, and I agree with your assessment of Jirani, of course,
*  I don't see how an Islamic state in Syria in the long term is beneficial to Israel.
*  But perhaps you can talk about all that.
*  Okay. Because we have to go back a little bit and look. There's been this huge change
*  in Israel from just over a year ago when the whole paradigm of Israel was overturned and
*  suddenly we saw the Mizrahi coming into the government. They were really antagonistic
*  to the European-style Israelis from the Kibbutzniks, the Ashkenazi. They were hostile to them.
*  They had three agendas, basically. They had one agenda was to establish Israel on the
*  land of Israel. Translated, no Palestinian state. The second one was to create, if you
*  like, a really Jewish state, Jewish in spirit, and they think that they have it. And the
*  third element was halakhic law to come in. I mean, the secularists in Israel didn't
*  like this one bit and were. And Israel is deeply divided on this front and other fronts
*  at the moment, almost to the point of civil war, just short of it. Netanyahu has become
*  ever more authoritarian, controls literally everything personally. He has a clear view
*  of the coalition, which is very much at the right. But the other important change that's
*  taken place is an epistemological change. They're no longer secular. The Israelis that
*  you might have known in the 70s and 80s were secular Europeans. These people are biblical
*  and there's an eschatological element to it, which changes the epistemological. There's
*  no point talking about rationality and does this make sense or is this in their interest
*  because they have a vision. And it's not about just the vision, but the vision is you requires
*  and mandates your commitment and your belief in it. You're not supposed to reason with
*  it. You take it. And this is the vision of the future. So there's this being a big change.
*  And moving towards this, Israel has moved through what I call magical wars. The wars
*  are quite magical. I mean, in Gaza, it's a great victory. It's a huge, even though it
*  isn't a victory at all. It's far from it. Hamas is still there, but it's presented as
*  a huge victory and already they're organizing for settlers to come in and take the land
*  of northern Gaza and subsequently to repopulate that. Settlers are already putting their names
*  down to be in the settlements of Gaza. And then we say in West Bank, it's also a great
*  victory because Smotrich, who's a minister in the cabinet, minister of defense, as well
*  as administration of the West Bank, he's actually delegitimizing the whole of the Palestinians
*  in the West Bank. And then they claim a great victory against Hezbollah in the south of
*  Lebanon, even though they suffered enormous losses, had to pull all the reserves out.
*  So they're in a fix because the army doesn't have enough men. It's about 20 percent under
*  staff for every commitments it's already got. And increasingly reservists are not showing
*  up to duty. The army say they're exhausted, but primarily they say there's no plan. There's
*  no structure. What are our objectives? What are we actually trying to do? Oh, this is
*  a little bit sort of rational. He isn't on the same page. He's working towards the grand
*  victory, which is something different. So we've had a sort of magical construct. And
*  so the magical part of it now is Syria, another great victory for Iran on the route to the
*  war on Iran. So this is what it's all about, showing how it's successful and it's going
*  on. And now the final cherry on the cake is to persuade the United States that it has
*  to support Israel in its war on Iran. And of course, suddenly we have the nuclear weapon
*  being presented as the if you like the motive for this war. And you see Trump even now saying,
*  oh, well, what's happened? You know, it's partly to do with Ukraine, but it's also because
*  of Israel's fighting successes. Well, most Israelis would say we haven't got any successes.
*  This is all, you know, magical. I describe it as like it's like a Ponzi scheme. You know,
*  this is a financial scam, but in this case, it's a geopolitical Ponzi scheme in the sense
*  that every everything is a victory for Israel. Everything is taking us closer to ultimate
*  victory. Ultimate victory is to get rid of the head of the octopus, which is Iran. And
*  we're moving towards this great victory. And there are all these people trying to stop
*  us. Biden is trying to stop us. All sorts of people are trying to stop us. But we're
*  on it. So it's very important, like a Ponzi scheme, if you stop making money, the thing
*  crashes. If you find people as a sort of withdrawing money from the fund and saying, well, is this
*  really going to work? Is this really a good idea? Then you're finished. And so Netanyahu's
*  structure is a sort of magical thinking that he's got to keep everything to be a victory,
*  moving towards the direction that he's always wanted it to go, is pulling and vaguely in
*  the United States through some provocation that they will do on Iran into supporting
*  a war. Now, I just add, because I don't want to give the wrong impression. I think a war
*  with Iran would be disastrous for Israel, might even destroy Israel, and it would be
*  a great defeat for the United States. I won't go into the reasons for that, but just to
*  say, I don't think people have thought this through. I mean, it's based on the simple
*  sort of understanding, absolute conviction in the West. Russia is weak. America is weak.
*  Israel is strong. Israel is strong. Iran is weak. And there's nothing you can say really
*  against it. And then you have some four star general, Jack Keane, coming up on television
*  in the US and saying, well, the Israelis have knocked out Iran's air defenses. The Israelis
*  have damaged the nuclear program by the attack on Parchin. The Israelis have really reduced
*  Iran. It lies naked before us. It is stunningly vulnerable. And this is what those talking
*  heads on CNN are saying, clearly, laying the grounds. Parchin is held up. But it's really
*  no different from when Colin Powell went on television all those years ago before 2006,
*  that you see what's in this vial here? This is weapons of mass destruction, and this is
*  what the war is going to be about. They didn't strike anything at Parchin. There's clear
*  evidence that the Israelis were not able to even fire ballistic missiles. They never got
*  closer than 70 kilometers to the Iranian frontier. So this is a magical, it's difficult to deal
*  with us in a Western way, like most of the audience would like me to say, on the one
*  hand, on the other hand, because we're talking about something that has moved into an eschatological,
*  if you like, mindset that this is ordained. This is the Bible. This is what the Torah
*  says. This is what we are going for. And we do it because we have to believe in revelation.
*  Forget rationality. It's revelation.
*  I want to ask about the Turks. And I spent a lot of time in Northern Iraq, actually spent
*  time with the PKK, covered all of the fighting in Southeastern Turkey, including the Nehruz
*  Rebellion. The Turks are obsessed with this U.S.-backed Kurdish militia force that controls
*  the oil fields in the north and east of Syria. One has to assume that the Kurds are not going
*  to do anything. They assume that that's the next move. They want to essentially push the
*  Kurds out and seize those oil fields. That's my hypothetical, or that's my guess. Is that
*  correct?
*  So it started. They were already attacking Manbij. They're attacking those Kurdish groups
*  there. And more than that, because this is one of the big fractures taking place, because
*  Turkey is determined to destroy the Kurdish. They see them as terrorists and a great threat
*  to Turkey. Let's have no doubt. This is a white, it's not just Erdogan, this is a white
*  Turkish view. Not everyone in Turkey holds it. But then you have these, and now there
*  is real fighting going on in Manbij. And on the other side, you have Israel saying, we
*  want to build up this Kurds. We would like a Kurdish state to be formed in the eastern
*  part. Join them to Erbil and join to Iraq. And that's our objective. And so the two of
*  them are, and unfortunately, this is going to be the case not just in the Kurdish part,
*  but in many parts of Israel, there's going to be a clash as things go on between the
*  interests of Jolani and the leadership there, and the interests of others. What happens
*  to the Alawites? What happens to Latakia? This is a stretch along the coast where the
*  Russian bases are, but has always been historically an Alawite sort of state, shall we say. So
*  I mean, there's going to be, and some of the Syrian army have sort of kept their forces
*  a little bit together. I don't want to sound too much. They took all the armor into Iraq.
*  A whole division took its armor into Iraq. We've seen it before happen in other places,
*  for example, in Egypt, how even though a military that has been defeated and has been discredited,
*  somehow bits of it come together and find popular support. So will they come in and
*  start fighting Jolani's groups? What will happen? No one knows. It's going to be, I
*  think, a really huge mini wars, cultural wars fighting. I think Turkey thought it would
*  be able to sort of manage these like the puppet master from outside in Ankara. I think that
*  already that's gone. Already. Yes, Russia's influence is gone. Iran's influence is gone,
*  but I think Turkey's is just evaporating now before our eyes because they're not being
*  able to do what they think they were going to do in the Northeast. I don't want to say
*  he wants to take the whole of the Northern strip right across Syria through to Iran as
*  a big, big buffer zone to protect him from any influences from outside. I don't see how
*  the Syrian economy is going to function if they don't get back the oil fields. And we
*  should be clear. One of the things that many things that led to Assad's deep unpopularity,
*  aside from really savage repression, was also the fact that there was only electricity an
*  hour a day in Damascus. Prices were astronomical. Unemployment was widespread. Of course, you
*  had sanctions against Syria, but those oil fields, aren't they vital? I mean, if they
*  don't recapture those oil fields, how are they going to ever... And much of the country
*  is destroyed and has not been rebuilt. It's one of the problems with the millions of people,
*  Syrian refugees. There's nothing to go back to. This is what I was saying. The oil has
*  been taken. That is also the agricultural land of Syria. That is now occupied by the
*  Kurds. So they lost the revenues from agriculture, the revenues from oil, and the industrial
*  parties around Aleppo and Idlib, and that has been under Turkish control for this period.
*  And they're all being under sanction. So, I mean, the people have been... I mean, there's
*  absolute poverty in Syria, and people are in despair and have lost hope. And this has
*  been a big case. And I do think what you're saying is very important because I think it's
*  fundamental to also to the Russian calculations. Okay, Turkey, all right, the West, you've
*  broken Syria. You broke it. You pay for it. Because it's going to cost a huge amount
*  of money. At the moment, Qatar is paying for the electricity in Aleppo. It's having to
*  pay for... That's a big bonus for HDS that Aleppo now has electricity at night and all
*  the day because Qatar was given 30 million or something to pay. But that's just one part
*  of it. I mean, the whole state would need rebuilding and reconstructing. And I think
*  that's ultimately why the thing collapsed because it was just irrecoverably financially,
*  militarily, and actually institutionally, because the institutions have become very
*  much affected by it. I mean, the Ba'ath party has been long decrepit in Syria. And I think
*  the Assadists find it impossible to reform it.
*  Can you draw parallels between the US invasion and occupation of Iraq, also based, of course,
*  on magical thinking? Is that the kind of chaos that you envision enveloping Syria?
*  Well, I think there is one thing that is very clear what happened. I mean, was the planning
*  for this? In Iraq, particularly the British and America had bought off most of the army,
*  the Revolutionary Guards, Republican Guards, had been bought off large amounts, even in
*  gold. And so when it came to it, they didn't fight. It was already sort of half-ordained.
*  But then they didn't know what to do with it, how to take forward. And I think it was
*  really sort of very much expressed by the governor. What was his name that came in?
*  Not Kenan. I can't remember. But the first appointed governor of Iraq. And he arrived
*  then, he said, listen, I know nothing about Iraq. I don't know about its culture. I don't
*  know its history. I know nothing. But I'm here because I'm an expert in neoliberal
*  economics. And there was no empathy. There was no sense of how to bring people together
*  to deal with it and manage it. And I see zero sign that at this stage anyone like the governor
*  likely to come forward and be able to have that sort of charisma and to have that understanding
*  of how to bring humans, to lead humans towards a sort of sense of understanding a community
*  again, to being part of belonging, being connected again to a society. And the Syrians just feel
*  and all the elements feel so disconnected from society. I think they feel it, they just
*  don't see how they're going to connect. So they just look after themselves. Someone offers
*  them $400 for a weapon. Why not? That's like a fortune. Take it. So I think this is partly
*  again, the sort of why Russia does understand it a lot better than the West, what's happening.
*  And I think Russia sees a big picture all the time. It sees a big picture about the
*  building forces. I mentioned Lavrov saying we're moving towards a hot war. And he is
*  preparing and it's all about Mekinda and the heartland, i.e. the heartland of Central
*  Asia. And this is why he's preparing for it because I think, and I wrote about this just
*  recently in quoting some Russians who are very close to him, you know, the West gets
*  this entirely back to front. Putin has said this time and time again. He said it to the
*  foreign ministry at his speech and he said it again in the press conference at Astana
*  the other day. I will not accept a freezing of the conflict. I will not accept that because
*  I know what you want to do is you just want to then take the rump that is Ukraine afterwards
*  and NATOise it and rearm it and be prepared for the next war in a few years' time against
*  Russia. No. We'll have to go back to it and look at it. How do we serve this properly?
*  How do we serve it in a fundamental way? And what he says strikes me as correct. He says
*  he goes back. The basic problem arose on the, if you like, the unification of Germany when
*  America gave the guarantees that that frontier, the border of Germany represented the border
*  of NATO and not just NATO but of Atlantis' interests, economic, institutional, whatever
*  you like, that there had to be some sort of agreement. So what he's been saying in what
*  was in those treaties of December 21 was saying we have to have an architecture. We have
*  to have some basic understandings where the frontier now lies between Atlantis' interests
*  and the interests of Central Asia, the heartland, the world, if you like, of the Central Asia,
*  China, Iran, all of that right to the coast. And you have to start with that and then eventually
*  you get down to the actual issue, which is Ukraine, because once you agree sort of over
*  architecture, Ukraine will naturally fit somewhere into that. We can't say how exactly, but it
*  may be parts of it will go to Poland and to Hungary or something or not. But get the big
*  picture. Don't come here and just say, states are in Ukraine, because you're inverted the
*  whole thing. You've got the wrong end of the stick and you don't listen and hear what I'm
*  saying to you. So I think it's very important. And he even gave a big hint in his statement
*  from behind his desk in his office. And he said, and what he said was, you know, I feel
*  it was a great mistake in 2019 when you, the United States, did away with the intermediate
*  missile treaty agreement. And that's what he said. But if Trump's team heard it and
*  paid attention, so, you know, why not send an envoy and we say, you know, Mr. Putin,
*  it was really interesting what you said in that talk. And you said that was a mistake.
*  Would you like to sort of say what you see is a way to deal with this and what would
*  be the future and how we would arrive at that sort of thing? And then, you know, ultimately
*  we will get to Ukraine in the discussion. But if you come in and say, freeze, we want
*  to freeze, otherwise we're going to hit you with no sanctions or we're going to sanction
*  you more or do this or that or send more attack hands, it won't work. So, I mean, he gave
*  a pretty good clue. This is diplomacy. You come in and you don't start off saying, let's
*  cut to the chase. That's your better mind. This is mine. Cut the difference. It's not
*  a real estate deal. It has to be done differently. And Putin said, why not, you know, this isn't
*  a, let's talk about that. Let's see if there's an agreement. If we do that, then we get into
*  the architecture of Europe, the whole security architecture. And that matters a lot to Putin.
*  I know it does.
*  Well, I'm not no fan of Trump, but in terms of Ukraine, it's far more, the Trump administration
*  appears to speak far more rationally than the Biden administration. I want to go back
*  to Syria and just to close, how could this all go terribly wrong? Paint for us the ways
*  this could just unravel in ways that jeopardize stability within the Middle East and perhaps
*  even globally.
*  I think the first thing would be just to look at the immediate area. And the first one would
*  be Lebanon, where there is a strong pocket in Tripoli of those who would support Iran
*  strongly against the Shi. The Shi were about 45 to 55% of the population in Lebanon. But
*  the tensions, the fractures are very obvious in Lebanon because of the ceasefire and because
*  of Israel's massive bombing of civilian areas to try and bring a ceasefire about. Then you
*  go up to Iraq, the Kurds in Erbil, are they going to see the Kurdish colleagues wiped
*  out by Turkey there? And what is going to happen to the Hashad? The Hashad are the militia
*  which are part of the Iraqi army. I mean, they're formerly part of the Iraqi army, but
*  they're quite autonomous in many ways. And these have been working with Iran and these
*  groups are now armed and now they've had a whole division of Syrian forces. And the Syrian
*  forces are now placed inside. Are they going to go and fight the HTS as they sort of encroach
*  and try and cut off Iraq from Syria, as is very likely? Then you move further away. How
*  does all this look in the sort of relationship that matters so much to the United States
*  between the Gulf states and Islam and the region as a whole? And I started off by saying
*  talking about the sort of big shift, the shift between Iran was at the apex and Saudi Arabia
*  and the Gulf states were at the bottom. And then it was the Americans tried to turn it
*  upside down. But the greatest, Saudi Arabia will be very nervous, I believe, to see the
*  Ottomans claiming to be one of the leaders of the world as Erdogan just did and to treat
*  the Saudis as just another branch of Islam that he doesn't pay a great deal of attention
*  to. And I think also because inevitably, although they say they won't, I mean already Hezbollah
*  is mandatory in Syria and women are being rounded up in some places. And I don't know
*  what's happening to them. This is in part of the Kurdish areas that are run by the Americans,
*  and what happens if the Kurds are really under pressure and they release 50,000 ISIS from
*  their prison in Kurdistan? What then will Iraq do? What will the Iraqi forces do? Will
*  they enter into Syria to deal with the ISIS that have been released into the people? There
*  will be more ISIS released in Damascus from the prisons that by Jalani. But the point
*  is that MBS, Mohammed bin Salman, and the Gulf states, they've adopted the Western lifestand
*  almost completely. They're like girls not quite scantily dressed in their palaces and
*  on the beach and things like this. And he's moved in many ways. Alcohol is pretty freely
*  available and things like this. I don't think he's going to be happy seeing this sort of,
*  because it really hurts, because he is a Wahhabi establishment. The sources of Wahhabism
*  are in the Najat, not in Jeddah. And this is going to make him, I think, very uneasy
*  indeed. And so is he going to put money into forces that are opposed to Erdogan? Will he
*  support factions? Well, you see it already. Doha has already come in. Doha, which is at
*  odds with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states on these issues of the Muslim Brotherhood.
*  Of course, Qatar is a Wahhabi state. Are they going to go and support it? They're already
*  supporting it in Aleppo, providing all the funding to try and support the credibility
*  and the public appeal of it. That's how the whole region can change. And Israel, within
*  this, it sees itself as a grand victor. But I think what has happened and what will increasingly
*  happen, whether Jairani is the leader or not, Israel is seen and disliked by much of the
*  world, whether they're pro-ISIS or anti-ISIS, for what's happened to Gassan. The Middle
*  East, many of the states are just seething with anger about it. There are pockets that
*  side with Israel in Syria, in Lebanon, but they don't count. They're impotent. They don't
*  count anything. The great feeling is against it. Then you come to Jordan. What happens
*  to Jordan in these circumstances? Because Jordan has got right on the border there.
*  Will they come across? Will they invade? Jordan also has a huge Muslim Brotherhood contingent
*  and it also has some quite salafist elements in it too. It's been very tense in this period
*  as it is. Very tense because of what's been happening in West Bank and in Gaza. Jordan
*  is terrifying that Israel will eventually push the Palestinians out of the West Bank
*  and describe Jordan as a new Palestinian state. The push on Palestinians in the West Bank
*  is intense and they are leaving and they are moving as the settlers. There is a big army
*  of settlers, 10,000 strong, now armed by Ben-Gavir. I believe, I can't say for sure, but what
*  I hear from inside Israel is there's going to be an attempt by Ben-Gavir who's in charge
*  of the police, coordinated with Smodrich, to clear the Palestinians out of Area C.
*  Area C is a sort of area in the West Bank where there is joint security, supposedly
*  joint security responsibility between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. I think
*  really they envisage South Lebanon to be another Area C that they will take over in the same
*  way. That's why I would see these things. Meanwhile, the tensions in Israel are growing.
*  Netanyahu goes to court I think this week. There are big divisions. The Israeli government
*  attorney general says that Ben-Gavir is an illegal cabinet member. She says that you
*  cannot delay this court case, the attorney general. Ben-Gavir and the cabinet say the
*  attorney general must be sacked. There's deep divisions within the army who say there's
*  no plan, there's no policy, there's no blueprint, and we're getting killed. The orthodox don't
*  get killed. Why do our sons have to bear the loss of life and the orthodox a fee to study
*  in their yeshiva? Why is all this happening? Israel is deeply, deeply divided. Many of
*  those Israelis, even former national security members, feel that Israel is on the brink
*  of a collapse, not in the sense of just a military one, but of an institutional collapse
*  because all of the structures of law and how the army work. It is becoming, in brief, I
*  use this as a shorthand, but it's becoming a war between the kingdom of Judea and the
*  state of Israel. Ben-Gavir has a mini army of 10,000 settlers all armed, all who obey
*  his particular radical rabbis, very radical people who talk about the oral Talmud and
*  not just the Talmud, and then the rather secular Europeanized state of Israel who want to bring
*  everything under a judicial process and to have the army being, if you like, a neutral
*  element. This clash is profound. What will come out of it, Israelis don't know. It's
*  not the victory that Netanyahu is proclaiming. It's very tentative. As I say, it's all based
*  on the sort of magical thinking that we're on our path to Armageddon with Iran and then
*  everything will be resolved. Gaza will be resolved. Lebanon will be resolved. Syria,
*  Iraq, all done because we will have defeated the head of the octopus.
*  And just two last questions. What happens to the Palestinians pushed into southern Gaza?
*  Clearly they will empty the north. They're far down that road already. It's a catastrophic
*  humanitarian crisis in the south. There's no clean water. There isn't enough food. People
*  are living out in the open. What happens in southern Gaza? Does it just sit and fester
*  the Egyptians? I was just in Egypt. I was actually in the West Bank this summer and
*  in Jordan. My understanding is the Egyptian military has been categorical. The Palestinians
*  will not be pushed into the Sinai. What happens? At the moment, Netanyahu and his cabinet,
*  it's not just Netanyahu, but the support and the support in the population want to just
*  continue with the process of the slow decimation of the population in Gaza. And there's no,
*  I mean, they don't have, again, there's no plan, no solution except to continue the squeeze
*  and to continue with the military intervention to make life unbearable. And Smotrich says,
*  well, maybe in the next few years, two thirds of them will opt to leave because there's
*  nothing in Gaza. It's just rubble, no schools, no hospitals, nothing. It's all been destroyed.
*  And clearly the aim is eventually ethnic cleansing, is to clear out the whole of Gaza because
*  they have plans and Smotrich has plans and Ben-Gibia has plans for about 50 settlements
*  to be placed in the place of Gaza. And the Palestinians will hold out. They are very
*  tough. They are very strong-minded and they will hold out and it will be, I mean, a daily
*  unfolding tragedy. I can't even bring myself to watch some of the videos that come out
*  of there of children and people burnt alive and so on. But I see no solution to this as
*  long as Netanyahu and the cabinet. And I don't see any particular immediacy to a fall of
*  the government at this stage. I mean, who knows? There's the trial coming up. Anything
*  can happen. The whole thing can collapse. I mean, because it's all very precariously
*  based on this tiny sort of fulcrum of Netanyahu's power and his sort of vision of great victory
*  and the support that he gets for that.
*  Just to close, how likely do you think a war with Iran is?
*  I think it's likely. I think it's likely for the following reason. I think that it's not
*  about Iran. Particularly, it's nothing to do with Iran. Firstly, they want to disrupt
*  Trump, to pull him into, if you like, a war on Iran. They think it will be an easy war.
*  I think they've got this totally wrong. They think it will be an easy war. But they want
*  to reassert, if you like, American power and leadership. And they feel that doing every
*  so often, throwing a small country against the wall and smashing it up is good for this.
*  And I think I'm not being too cynical. I think that they feel they need a war. There is a
*  strong sense in that, if you like, ruling card, not for Americans as a whole, but for
*  within that, if you like, that they have to reassert those deep layers of American policy,
*  which are they will not tolerate any, if you like, rival power, any challenge to American
*  leadership and American greatness and American sense of its vision for the future to occur
*  on their watch. And therefore, this has been bedrock, bipartisan bedrock at this deeper
*  layer of structure that no politician is allowed to challenge. And so I think they
*  will probably do it. It's not about is it good or bad. I don't think Trump will be able
*  to because they control. The other thing is basically the Israeli first is wanted, and
*  they control Congress. And they have the money to do this. And they probably will do it.
*  But is that an aerial campaign? How physically would they send troops into Iraq?
*  They can't send troops. No, they can't. You can't. You can't. It's population is 90 million,
*  and it's as big as Europe virtually. Couldn't do this. No. It's only by, and here's why
*  I disagree with the consensus in America. They think it's by air assault, shock and
*  a great campaign that will go in and bust it. But the technical reasons for why that
*  won't work are plentiful. First of all, Iran has excellent air defenses from Russia, but
*  their own as well. And the Israelis, contrary to what the media say, were not able to penetrate
*  into Iranian airspace when they attempted that strike 26 of, I think it was October.
*  They were not able to penetrate into their airspace. And when you're talking about nuclear
*  program or programs that are deeply buried underground, you saw what happened in Beirut
*  together. The Hezbollah leadership, it took 85 heavy missiles. And if you're going to
*  fly F-35s with JDAM missiles, each of those is about 14 tons. I mean, it's not just the
*  weight they can carry them, but the fuel they use. So you have to refuel maybe once, refuel
*  twice. Then you have to fight aircraft to suppress their defenses. I mean, you're talking
*  about a huge performance. Is America going to be able to do this? And the Israelis have
*  got multiple, the Iranians have got multiple air defense systems and good radars, over
*  the horizon radars as well. And we were told that they damaged the air defense systems,
*  this Parchin, this was essential. There's been nothing. I followed it. I think you mentioned
*  it in your lead-in that I was involved with Iran on the nuclear side for the European
*  Union when Salana was leading that. I mean, we've been dealing with Parchin for 20 years.
*  The Israelis have been claiming it's got a secret site there. And the IEA have been
*  inspected it multiple times and found nothing. And there was nothing this time. They bombed
*  two empty warehouses. It was during Khatami's presidency that anything sensitive was taken
*  away from Parchin and put deep into the mountain tunnels.
*  Great. Thank you very much. That was fascinating and brilliant. I want to thank Diego, Max,
*  Thomas and Sophia who produced the show. You can find me at chrishedges.substack.com.
