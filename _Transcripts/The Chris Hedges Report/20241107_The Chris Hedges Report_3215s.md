# The World According to Trump (w Col. Wilkerson)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br_xcGgoXio)
*  Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, retired and former chief of staff to Secretary of State,
*  Colin Powell is a Vietnam War veteran who attended Airborne School, Ranger School,
*  and the Naval War College, and who was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam,
*  logged over a thousand hours on combat missions. He went on to serve as deputy director of the
*  Marine Corps War College at Quantico and was executive assistant to Admiral Stuart Ring,
*  United States Navy Pacific Command and director of the United States Marine Corps War College.
*  His disillusionment with the trajectory of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East
*  followed the revelations of detainee abuse, the ineptitude of post-invasion planning for
*  Iraq, and the secretive decision-making by the Bush administration that led to the invasion of
*  Iraq. At a congressional hearing recorded on C-SPAN in June 2005, he gave his analysis of the
*  Iraq War's motivation as, quote, I use the acronym OIL. He said O for oil, I for Israel,
*  and L for the logistical base necessary or deemed necessary by the so-called Neocons,
*  and it reeks through all their documents, the logistical base whereby the United States
*  and Israel could dominate that area of the world. Wilkerson has said that the speech Colin Powell
*  made before the United Nations on February 5, 2003, which laid out a case for war with Iraq,
*  included falsehoods of which he and Powell had never been made aware. My participation in that
*  presentation, he said at the UN, constitutes the lowest point in my professional life.
*  I participated in a hoax on the American people, the international community, and the United
*  Nations and Security Council. He called the UN presentation probably the biggest mistake of my
*  life. He has taught at the College of William and Mary and George Washington University. He's a
*  senior fellow at the Eisenhower Media Network, a group of former military, intelligence, and civilian
*  national security officials who describe themselves as offering an alternative analysis untainted
*  by Pentagon or defense industry ties, and countering Washington's establishment narrative
*  on most national security issues of the day. Joining me to discuss US foreign policy,
*  the conflicts raging in the Middle East, including the genocide in Gaza, the Ukraine,
*  the fate of the American Empire, and of course, the election of Donald Trump is Colonel Lawrence
*  Wilkerson. Let's begin with the election and its effect. I mean, you saw the intelligence community
*  milly, all sorts of figures, essentially joined the democratic campaign in support of Kamala Harris.
*  Let's talk about why Trump triggers such deep animus within the Pentagon and the intelligence
*  community, and what you see happening during a second Trump administration.
*  I think the animus was created within my community anyway. I still call it that, the Pentagon,
*  the military in general, because they don't see any concerted effort on his part to express a
*  strategic appraisal that agrees with theirs. Theirs being the one most parroted by the New
*  York Times, for example, and others of their ilk, who are simply spokespersons for the military
*  industrial complex and for the national security state, which we have most assuredly become.
*  And so they're worried about anyone who would come in and threaten to break the China.
*  And that's what Trump, that's what his forte is, is threatened to break the China.
*  And they're very protective of their China, just as are the national security agencies in general,
*  and the 16, I guess it's 16 now, entities that we have that are supposed to be our intelligence
*  eyes and ears, led by the CIA, not led by the DNI, because he still has no real power over the CIA,
*  but led by the CIA. I would say Bill Burns is the most powerful guy in the United States with regard
*  to intelligence and what goes to the White House and what doesn't go to the White House.
*  So that's part of the reason they just don't know this guy except from the first term. And the first
*  term would not, through Kelly and Milley and other people's eyes, give you much hope if you were a
*  Pentagon member of the bureaucracy, if you will. The second reason, I think, is because he's so
*  mercurial. He's all over the map. And the military doesn't like that at all. They like constancy,
*  even if it's incorrect constancy. They prefer constancy to change and
*  mercurial nature. And I think that's a problem with them. And there's a third reason, too,
*  and that is that they're worried about what I call Christian nationalism. Some of them,
*  anyway. Others are aiding and abetting it. And what that means, in essence, is not just this
*  far-flung but very ripe and alive effort by certain Christian groups in America to make
*  Christianity the national religion, to change the Constitution in that effect or discard the
*  Constitution with regard to religion. But they're worried that they have flag officers in the
*  military who are very much Christian nationalists. We have an occasion right now that we're looking
*  at at the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, Mikey Weinstein's group out in New Mexico,
*  where the despair, the three-star general who is the chief of personnel, the personnel man for the
*  chief of staff of the Army, is married to a woman who rolls in the aisle and speaks in tongues.
*  And Mikey's obtained video of this general in uniform, being at one of her gatherings with
*  this group. That's just the surface, if you will. There are people like General Flynn, for example,
*  who are still in the military. So that's disconcerting for the bulk of the military
*  that doesn't subscribe to this theory or this desire to do away with the Constitution when
*  it comes to freedom of religion. Those things are bothering them, and Trump has shown a propensity
*  to use the Christian movement in this country for political gain and to not have much in the way of
*  regard for what that might mean otherwise. So that's disturbing. Yeah, I graduated from Harvard
*  Divinity School and wrote a book on the Christian right a little over a decade ago called American
*  Fascist, the Christian Right and the War on America. Of course, no, Mikey's work. Well,
*  let's just unpack that. Why do they see Christian nationalism? It's interesting that you raised
*  that as an issue. Why do they see that as such an important issue? Just explain in their vision and
*  perhaps yours how that could roll out in a really negative way. You're talking about the way the
*  military looks at it, at least those who aren't. I think they're most concerned about it in terms
*  of what it might mean for the tyranny that would have to come along with it. And they're having to
*  enforce that tyranny because if you make Christianity the national religion, and that's their ultimate goal
*  is to not just put Bibles in classrooms and stop abortions completely, not those social issues that
*  always loom up and paint them with their brush. The secret that they want no one to know until
*  it happens is they do want Christianity to be the national religion. In that regard, we even have a
*  branch of American Catholics who are working on this. If you look closely at what's happened in
*  the last 50 years in particular with the Catholic Church, my wife was Catholic, so I'm aware of some
*  of the things in the Catholic Church that I wouldn't have been aware of had she not been.
*  She's passed away now, but if you look closely at it, there is this behind-the-scenes movement
*  in America to create an American Catholic Church. We don't like it being in Rome, its head being in
*  Rome. We don't like Francis in particular. We despise Francis. When I say we, using a rhetorical
*  device to describe these people, we'd like to have our own pope and our own Catholic Church.
*  There are people, some would say one or two, on the Supreme Court right now,
*  or of that mind too, and would work for that or might be working for that were they given the
*  occasion to do so. You put that together, that Roman Catholicism, Opus Dei-like Roman Catholicism,
*  and the other people who are, for example, like John Hagee, funding millions of dollars to West
*  Bank settlers in Israel, even now. You've got a real fear on the part of rational military people
*  this might get out of hand. Be more specific, in what way?
*  If you make Christianity the national religion and you do all the things that you would have to do
*  constitutionally and otherwise, or just totally disregard the constitution in that process,
*  which you get as we have just seen, probably enough Americans behind you to do it,
*  then you have a whole different ballgame for the military. The military then is called on
*  domestically and otherwise, and most Americans don't understand the domestic missions that the
*  army in particular, but the military in general, has to defend that. They don't want to. They
*  think that's fractious. They think that's unconstitutional. They think that's something
*  that would cause more harm than good. I'm glad to say that there are still some people like that
*  left in my military. Well, Trump has an ideological void, of course, but we saw in his first term that
*  he filled it with these Christian nationalists or Christian fascists, Betsy DeVos, Mike Pence,
*  Bill Barr, and others. Certainly, it appears that they will fill that void again.
*  I want to talk about Ukraine. Let me add one other thing. This is not just Trump. Remember,
*  I served in the George W. Bush administration. I cannot tell you how many times I had to deal
*  with the White House personnel office over such things as this man can't go to Iraq. Why can't
*  he go to Iraq? Why can't he serve in Iraq? He's not a Christian. Talk about counterintuitive.
*  Let's talk about Ukraine. Trump has deviated from the establishment consensus on Ukraine.
*  I never understood. Perhaps you can unpack it for me, the whole Ukraine policy, other than as a kind
*  of proxy war to degrade the Russian military and isolate Putin. I was in East Germany when the
*  Berlin Wall came down as a reporter. I was there when the promises were made to Gorbachev not to
*  extend NATO beyond the borders of a unified Germany. Of course, as you know, the Soviet Union had to
*  acquiesce to the reunification of Germany, and that was the promise made. Then we kind of,
*  I'm not defending the invasion, obviously, of Ukraine, but we certainly baited the Russians
*  Putin. Let's talk about Ukraine. I don't see how any military strategist seriously could think
*  that in a war of attrition, the Ukrainians could dominate. But explain what's happening and then
*  how you see, if there is going to be a difference, how you see a difference in
*  a Trump administration's policy towards Ukraine and Russia.
*  Let me say first, I was there too. I was special assistant to Chairman Powell. The
*  change that took place with the advent of Bill Clinton was absolutely disastrous.
*  I attribute to William Jefferson Clinton a lot of the problems we're living with today,
*  including the major violation of that promise not to expand NATO. That's a longer story,
*  better not for another time. I think what we're looking at in Ukraine vis-à-vis Trump or Trump
*  vis-à-vis Ukraine is his, and I think Doug McGregor, for example, is right about this.
*  I just watched him on Judge Napolitano's show. It's his disdain for war. I think it's genuine.
*  I don't think he likes war. I don't think he likes starting wars. I don't think he would be
*  a president who he'll go off and kill someone like the Iranian IRGC member or other people whom he's
*  told are terrorists or whatever. But I don't think he wants war, quay war. And so he's willing to
*  shut down Ukraine. Now, there's another reason too. I think he detests NATO for different reasons
*  than I. I don't like NATO much either. I think it's well beyond its sell-by date.
*  And he sees NATO as being, and he's right in this, as big an aider and a better Brussels is
*  of the war in Ukraine as Washington is, led by that perfidious Albian London.
*  And so he wants to shut that down. And I think his ultimate goal is to not abandon NATO per force,
*  but he wants to get the United States out of its relationship with NATO, which is, he thinks,
*  we pay for everything. We do all the heavy lifting. They do very little. Come back to the
*  United States, as it were, and say, you've got our nuclear umbrella, but everything else you do,
*  because we're not with you anymore. And of course, save the money that that saves too. I think that's
*  part of his, I think it was part of his first term and he just didn't get to do it the way he
*  wanted to do it. So those, I think, are the major reasons that he will be positive with regard to
*  Ukraine, because you're right, Ukraine is a disaster right now. And most apparently for Ukraine,
*  they're dying by the dozens every day now and they have no people left. They're having difficulty.
*  They're having to impress young people, bring them into the military to get them to fight. And
*  they're lucky if they don't desert within the first week, because either going over to the Russians
*  or running away wherever they can go. It's a disaster. And we've got, we don't have generals
*  in the Pentagon saying this. Now we have Lloyd Austin. He's right there with Joe Biden, but we
*  don't have generals in the Pentagon, in my view anyway, who are expressing these kinds of views
*  that generals on the outside are expressing, like David Petraeus and Barnes and other generals who
*  are saying, well, Russia's losing, they're lying through their teeth. They're lying through their
*  teeth. Either that or they're just stupid and incredibly dumb, really, not just stupid. So
*  I think Trump would shut that down. And I'm looking forward to that. I hope he does. I hope he shuts
*  it down forthwith. Well, they should have read the history of Germany's invasion of the Soviet
*  Union. Stalin would send out a million men who would either get captured or die. And then he'd
*  just send out another million. That was kind of the Putin strategy. And people don't realize that
*  the Wehrmacht, right after it invaded really, the first 14 months began to lose almost immediately.
*  Partly because of its repine as it moved along and made enemies of everyone in its path, even
*  Napoleon. Well, that's stupid. And partly because they overextended and partly because the rule of
*  thumb that Hitler thought would work, his food minister told him it would work, that all that
*  food coming from Ukraine and the steps of Russia would feed not only the Wehrmacht forces going
*  that way, but Germany too didn't come true. Yeah, that's because the Russians destroyed everything
*  in a scorched earth policy. We can do another show on World War II, which I have an obsession
*  with, but he also split his forces because of Stalingrad. Let's talk about the Middle East.
*  What will be the difference between a Biden administration and a Trump administration
*  vis-a-vis the genocide in Gaza, in Lebanon, the attacks in Lebanon, which I want you to talk about
*  because they're not going particularly well for Israel, and then this knife's edge we're sitting
*  on between Israel and Iran? I could get very complicated and complex here and try to describe
*  what I think is going on over there. And I've made as much of an effort as probably anyone in this
*  country to keep up with it. But let me just say right now what I'm concerned about with Trump
*  coming in. I'm concerned about something happening between the time that this is all consolidated,
*  which won't be long apparently, and the inauguration and what the Biden administration does.
*  Let me interrupt you, Larry. What do you mean by consolidated?
*  Well, there's going to be some court cases and other things, I'm sure, but it's going to be
*  pretty quick, I think, because the margin of victory is so great. It may look razor thin,
*  but it's pretty great from what I've seen, popular vote and electoral college. So all those things
*  that the election task force, I was a member of, for example, were worried about with a razor thin
*  margin aren't going to happen. So we're going to get satisfied in the votes to the electoral college
*  and the process complete pretty quickly, I think. I don't think the Democrats will be
*  like the Republicans would be had it been the other way around. And I'm a Republican,
*  so I can get away with saying that. I'm worried about what's going to happen because I think
*  Bibi is still intent, and Bahrain-Yorub-Ghalat was indicative of this par excellence, he's still
*  intent on going after Iran, but he's intent on the United States going with him. And the force
*  deployments that we've made, the force deployments we're making right now, the number of troops we're
*  sending actually to Israel right now, indicates to me that we are cognizant of this fact. We might
*  not be yet ready to go along with it, but we are cognizant of it to the point where we're putting
*  the forces in place that we think will be necessary. I think we're wrong. I think we're
*  going to get our rear ends handed to us if we do what Netanyahu wants to do with regard to Iran,
*  which is full-bore war. We're going to find out how weak we are when we do it. If Iraq and
*  Afghanistan weren't sufficient, this will certainly seal the deal. But I'm worried about this interim
*  period and what the Biden administration might actually do in this interim period, not just to
*  do what Bibi wants them to do and what I think Joe Biden is inclined to do, but to mess Trump up.
*  What better way than the inauguration takes place while we're involved in a huge war in the Middle
*  East? And it would be a huge war if we go at it big time the way Bibi wants. And we discover
*  immediately that we can't do what we think we're going to do in a short period of time.
*  It's the old bugaboo again. Air power, air power, air power. Air power is not going to defeat Iran.
*  It's not going to stop their nuclear program. It's not going to defeat them. So you wind up
*  with a choice. You either invade or you stop. And that's not much of a choice, very bad choice.
*  My understanding is the Pentagon was always reticent. They did not want,
*  they blocked, there was a huge push in the interim between Bush and Obama to go to war with Iran.
*  And I understand you know more about it than I do. My understanding is the Pentagon just said,
*  absolutely not. They are saying that now. But you wonder how long that resistance can hold up if the
*  president of the United States is intent on, and this is the one place where Trump really worries
*  me, doing everything in his power for Israel. And Trump has made it quite clear that that's
*  his policy. That's his belief. And I think he's being honest about it. Of course there's the
*  AIPAC business and the money involved and Trump is, if anything, Trump is a transactional I want the
*  money man. But I think he's committed to it in a way that Miriam Adelson for example indicates
*  in the amount of money that she has. This is his largest donor, I think $100 million.
*  Well, what would be the difference then between a Trump administration vis-a-vis Israel
*  and a Biden administration? It can't get any worse for the Palestinians in Gaza.
*  What would be the difference? I agree. Although there was, I think,
*  and perhaps this is applicable on the other side too, but there was some political space opening
*  up for Harris. I think she was made aware, vividly aware, of how much the Gaza policy, if you will,
*  with regard to the Biden administration had harmed them. I would say it probably lost them almost
*  a quarter of the progressives that would have voted for him otherwise, particularly in some
*  of the battleground states, key states. And that political space opening up might have changed
*  policy with her somewhat. I'm not saying it would be a bolt-fast, but I am saying it might
*  have been a more mellow policy with regard to Israel and a harder policy on Netanyahu,
*  and a complicit policy. And we could do this if we wanted to to get him out of there.
*  We have the power to get him out of there if we wanted to use it. He's his own worst enemy in that
*  regard. But we're not. We're not doing that. We're leaving him in there, partly because we know that
*  those around him who might replace him would be just as bad as he, but with maybe a little bit
*  better record and a little bit better outlook on things, especially getting the hostages back.
*  And we've got some hostages that are left alive there too. So that political space would have given
*  her room, I think, to change policy somewhat, to mellow our policy a little bit. I don't think
*  Trump will do that. I think Trump is in for a penny and for a pound for Israel. And that's
*  dangerous. I just was looking this morning at the meeting between the Saudi national security
*  adviser, Blinken, and Jake Sullivan, and others, and very indicative of what's happening right now.
*  The Saudis were very forceful about not making a deal until there was a Palestinian state deal
*  that looked like it might have some viability, politically, if not in reality.
*  Now they are here and he just inked the deal, so to speak, making a bilateral relationship
*  go. Israel's not even in it. A security relationship. And this adds to the one we just did with the UAE.
*  We just did with Bahrain. All of them are different deals, but they all amount to almost
*  non-NATO major ally status. We just did one with Qatar, where Al-Yudhid is the biggest
*  Air Force base in the world. And it looks as if the GCC, the Gulf Cooperation Council,
*  is sort of being wedged aside and we're doing all these bilateral treaties, if you will,
*  with these countries. They don't have the force of treaties, but they're executive agreements for
*  defense cooperation and so forth. And so that means Mohammed bin Salman is now playing the
*  typical Saudi game of, I like Russia, I like China, but the United States is my old haven,
*  and I need the United States. So I'm going to make a bilateral deal with them. If that's happening,
*  they're worried about Iran. Even though they're talking more with Tehran than they've done in the
*  past, as are all the states, they're worried. They're worried about what might happen. They're
*  worried about what Iran might do if Israel doesn't attack Iran's oil facilities, because Iran will
*  wipe out all the oil facilities it can in the Gulf region. 20% of the world's oil supply won't make
*  any difference that we're 22 million barrels a day now if they do that, because the price of oil will
*  go to $300 a barrel. Insurers want to insure and shippers want to ship. They will have a real
*  problem. And the Saudis know that. That's their nest egg. That's their future. They're not going to
*  play with that in jeopardy. So they're back with the United States now. This is a very strange
*  meeting in my view, because the words were not there to support it, and then suddenly he's here
*  doing this. I'm worried. I'm worried that we might be walking into a war that we cannot walk
*  away from because of Netanyahu. But the Saudis, Qatar, they've all made it very clear that the
*  U.S. is not allowed to use these bases if there are strikes against Iran.
*  Well, the Prime Minister in Baghdad did too, but we went ahead and let the Israelis overfly Iraq.
*  And I'm told that the King of Jordan said no, then we did it anyway. And rather than look like a fool,
*  he said he had grudgingly given permission. So we don't seem to care about what they think. And if
*  it comes down to it, as this visit has just testified to, I think, if it comes down to it
*  and they have to choose, they're going to do what we want to do.
*  I want to talk about what a war with Iran would look like. The Iranian Air Force, as I understand,
*  is pretty decrepit, not very effective, outdated fighters, many going all the way back to the Shah.
*  I don't know what their air defenses are like. Certainly it would start out as an aerial
*  bombing campaign. Would it look like the bombing campaign that we carried out
*  under the Clinton administration against Iraq during the sanctions? What's it going to look like?
*  It's not going to look anything like that. In fact, it's going to look quite different,
*  and it's principally because of China, but more so Russia. I think the Israelis in this last attempt,
*  they're lying about it now, and I have that from very good sources. They're lying about it,
*  they're propagandizing it. They didn't do any damage at all to speak up to Iran. And the reason
*  they didn't was because they ran into a buzzsaw of Russian-provided air defense systems. They
*  didn't know what to do. They didn't know how to read the radars. They didn't know how to
*  jam the radars. Their suppression of enemy air defense, SEAD, did not work. They took a few out
*  but it didn't work enough to where the pilots thought they could go any further. So they launched
*  all their missiles, as I think was the plan originally for the first echelon after the SEAD
*  got through from outside Iran. They were deterred from going inside, and they would be deterred
*  again. And there's every reason to believe that there might be some S-400s as well as S-300s on
*  the ground. And the S-400, sorry Lockheed Martin, sorry Raytheon, consumed by Lockheed Martin,
*  is the best air defense system in the world. That's another thing that's happening right now
*  that's disturbing our defense contractors. Chinese and Russian equipment is outdoing in Ukraine and
*  in the Middle East American equipment, which is three or four times as expensive. One of the
*  reasons India is back with Russia again for its armaments and such, despite what our protests are.
*  So we're looking at a situation where we will think that aerial will be all we'll have to do,
*  that is to say bombing. Israel's going to think that. Israel really can't do anything other than
*  bomb Iran, ballistic missiles and bombing, air launch cruise missiles and such as that.
*  It's not going to do it. It's not going to work. It's simply not going to work. There'll be some
*  damage done. There'll be some toll in Tehran and elsewhere in the outlying territories where the
*  nuclear facilities are and such. But it's not going to work. So what do you do then?
*  I've wargamed this. I wargamed it with the lieutenant general of the Marine Corps who
*  took great censure from his own buddies in the Pentagon. He was retired at the time,
*  but he used to be my boss when I was down at Quantico at the War College.
*  And he said we would lose. He ran the war game two times just to prove that the computers were not
*  wrong. I think he's right. I think one of the things the Iranians will do is take out a U.S.
*  aircraft carrier that's 5,000 U.S. souls on the bottom of the sea or in the water.
*  And incidentally, we now have so few escorts for our CVs, our aircraft carriers, that let's say
*  there are 2,000 sailors in the water. We couldn't rescue them all because we don't have birth
*  space on the escort ships. Interesting development there. We can't even man some of our ships
*  because we're so short in terms of recruiting. I think it would be a disaster. And what do we
*  do when we get into a disaster like that? It's America. We don't back away. We don't retrench.
*  We don't check our six and look around and say maybe we made an error. We double down. That's
*  what we'll do. And then it will be a full-fledged war. And if you like Iraq and you like Afghanistan,
*  Iran will top $10 trillion, take 10 years to pacify if it's even moderately pacified,
*  and cost a fortune and blood and treasure. You're talking about ground forces going in?
*  That's the only way you rid the country of a nuclear power.
*  That's true. But where do they go in from? Iraq?
*  Well, you'd have to sit down and do what we did in the Pacific. I actually had the war plan for
*  taking on the Soviets in Iran. We were very worried about them looking for a warm water port around
*  Chabahar or Bandar Abbas. A typical Russian Empire thing to do. Go back and check the history of the
*  Russian Empire. We thought that was the case. So out in the Pacific, the force provider for all of
*  this, we were war planning for fighting the Russians, the Soviets inside Iran in the Zagros
*  Mountains and elsewhere. I know that terrain really well. It's not Iraq. Very different country.
*  Great strategic depth. 53% Persian. Great homogeneity amongst that 53%. A lot of problems
*  around the periphery, but basically a homogeneous population. 10 years, $10 trillion. And you still
*  haven't solved what you wanted to solve, which was to defeat the nation any more than you did.
*  I'm just curious, where would the ground troops go in from? I have a hard time believing the Iraqi
*  government, which is allied with Iran and Shia. We are illegal, illegal under international law
*  and under our own domestic law. We are illegally present in Syria right now. We're there protecting
*  oil going to Israel. Which Trump said got him in a lot of trouble, but it was an honest statement.
*  Yeah. And we would go through Syria without batting an eye.
*  Let's talk about how it might start. When we were doing the war game out in the Pacific,
*  our major invasion was amphibious. That'd be a little difficult today. We had a lot of amphibious
*  bottoms then. The ones we have today are broken, as the Kappendon of the Marine Corps.
*  And we don't have many. How would it start? So there would be an Iranian strike on Israel with
*  significant Israeli casualties. What do you see as the trigger? The debate in Tehran is heated
*  right now, I'm told. This is about 48 hours old, but Doug McGrayer sort of confirmed it this morning.
*  The debate is between the different groups of security personnel in Tehran,
*  the IRGC, the Guardian Council, the Ayatollah, the new president, and so forth. Do we continue
*  with our previous plan? And the previous plan was we're going to smack them and we're going to smack
*  them really hard. Israel is seeing nothing like what's coming. Much the way they're seeing
*  real casualties, significant casualties in Lebanon right now.
*  The debate is to whether to go ahead and do that or not, because they don't want, the new president
*  in particular doesn't want war with the United States. They've got enough problems, they don't
*  want war with the United States. I don't know how that debate's going to fall out, but if they decide,
*  and Netanyahu wants them to decide this, I'm quite confident of that, to go back a whole hog
*  at Israel and do some really significant damage that his propaganda machine cannot hide, which he
*  has done a lot of up to this point. Like for example, hiding the casualties in Lebanon. The
*  casualties are enormous in Lebanon right now. For the IDF, they're enormous, enormous.
*  Have you heard a figure? I have not. Have you heard a number? I've heard 4,000.
*  Here's the kicker. Modern armies do not show loss or win by KIA, battle, tactical, operational,
*  whatever. They show it by WIA, because they have such sophisticated battlefield surgery and such
*  sophisticated hospitals. Look at our casualties in Afghanistan. What you have is high rates of WIA.
*  The WIA is over 4,000. That's missing arms, missing legs, whatever. When you're looking at
*  a modern army fighting on interior lines, and Israel is very interior lines, no evacuation route
*  hardly at all, you look at the WIA, not the KIA. The WIA and Lebanon are screamingly high right now,
*  particularly for the IDF. I think you'll see them leaving. Very shortly you'll see them leaving,
*  or moving. They haven't moved very far. No, not at all. In terms of interior lines,
*  they haven't gone very far into Lebanon. What they're doing is precisely what they do
*  almost every time they encounter this kind of resistance, though they've never encountered
*  this kind of resistance. They bomb the hell out of the cities and the infrastructure. They kill
*  Lebanese. They even bomb time. Yeah, they got driven out in 82. Of course, that's the invasion
*  that created Hezbollah. I remember Sy Hirsch telling me a little while ago that the reason
*  that Netanyahu wants the United States to engage Iran is because he needs the U.S. to take out
*  Iran's air defense systems, which seems to be in agreement with what you said. Would that be
*  correct? I think so, but I think we are going to get a rude surprise too when we lose F-35s,
*  extended range F-15s, F-16s, and other flights that will come out of Al-Yadid and off carriers,
*  F-18s and such. We're going to lose a lot too. The war games said 30% attrition.
*  Wow. Is Israel's motive the same as pushing us to invade Iraq, which is Iran is a powerful
*  center within the region that it wants to essentially cripple the way it crippled Iraq?
*  Is that the motive behind the Israeli push for a war with Iran?
*  I think that's the major motive behind it. They see Iran as the last impediment to their hegemony
*  in the region. Let's talk about Israel from a military perspective because you know so much
*  more about this than I do. How do you look at Israel in the Middle East from a strategic
*  point of view as a U.S. ally? As a total liability, a strategic liability of the first order.
*  Right now, this moment right now, I would say Ukraine notwithstanding,
*  they're the greatest strategic liability we have.
*  You get a lot of no- Explain why.
*  Why? Because there's no positivity to it. Everything is us. Nothing is them.
*  I'd listen to- We took out a lot of those missiles
*  coming in from Iran. We did. We depleted our supplies to the point now where I'm not
*  sure even if we decided we were going to do a major aerial attack on Iran,
*  we wouldn't run out of munitions very shortly. Combine-
*  And the genocide. I think we supply 68% at this point of munitions to sustain the genocide in
*  Gaza. Is that correct? At least that much. If you look at the entire
*  panoply of things we've given Israel, I'd say Gideon Glevy at Haaretz is right when he says,
*  you share 50-50 responsibility for every death in Gaza and for that matter in Lebanon too.
*  How do you see it playing out in Gaza? I've actually been in the Middle East quite a bit
*  in the last year and Egypt twice. I spent much of the summer in Jordan, was in Qatar,
*  was in the West Bank. Everything I can glean, Israel of course wants to push them into the
*  Sinai and the Egyptian military, I was told by Egyptian journalists in Cairo, has just been
*  adamant, has told Sisi that there's no way a Palestinian is- In fact, according to them,
*  if Israel attempts to push the Palestinians into the Sinai and Sisi accepts them, he's finished.
*  That's what they said. But how do you see it playing out? We know what Israel's intent is,
*  which is of course depopulating, annexing northern Gaza. They're largely towards that goal of creating
*  a humanitarian crisis in the South, but eventually ethnic cleansing, these genocidal tactics are now
*  increasingly being used in the West Bank. How do you see it going? The US must be completely aware
*  of what Israel's intent is, but where do you see that developing? There are two sets of thoughts,
*  I think, or beliefs, strategic goals in the US and it depends on what body of people you're
*  talking about. Are you talking about Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, and a host of others,
*  Lindsey Graham, or are you talking about saner people, I would say, on the other side of the
*  aisle, or even in the Republican party? They think that Israel is doing our job for us,
*  as Bibi Netanyahu has wanted to say, if Israel was not killing or ridding the region of these Arabs,
*  Palestinian or otherwise, and think about how MBS must think about this,
*  we'd have to be doing it. And so he's doing us a great favor. He's doing our dirty work for us.
*  He even has said that publicly. The other side says, no, Israel is our ally and our friend,
*  and we have to stand by them. No matter how heinous Bibi is, we'd like to get rid of Bibi.
*  We'd like to put a different picture on Israel, but he's there and he's in charge and he's doing
*  what he needs to do. And then there's the group that I belong to, I think, that says, this is
*  horrible what we're doing. And we all warned about this in the military. We've learned about this.
*  David Petraeus even testified to Congress one day and let it slip that Israel was a greater
*  liability than a strategic asset. And maybe we ought to think about rearranging the relationship.
*  After that got out, of course, he walked those remarks back, as David has wanted to do.
*  But the military understands how much a strategic liability Israel truly is,
*  especially down in the ranks where people have actually had a chance to look at it, to study it,
*  to look at the history and to understand what's happened and understand the real history of it,
*  which is often propagandized by the Israelis and the US for consumption by the public. But the
*  military understands that history. The military understands liberty, for example. They understand
*  that those sailors were machine-gunned. We should be explained. That was the ship that the Israelis
*  attacked and killed. What was it? 36 or something? I can't remember. 31 US sailors were killed. Yeah.
*  Yeah, and a bunch wounded. And I don't think there's any question, having looked at some of the
*  investigation and some of the obscuration of that investigation, there's any doubt in my mind that
*  Israel did it intentionally. That was the 73 war. Yeah. I don't know whether it was because
*  they thought we were picking up information that they were uploading an atomic weapon
*  or they thought we were sharing some of the information we were picking up with a very
*  sophisticated spy ship, which Liberty was, with Moscow in an attempt to bring pressure on Israel.
*  I don't know what the reason was because they wouldn't let the investigators get into the real
*  nitty-gritty. The president cut it off. But I do know that Israel knew what they were doing.
*  Israel had carried out a series of massacres of captured Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai. That was
*  one of the theories. And the ship obviously would have known about that. Yeah. Well, you
*  remember in the London Times, I think it was reported, and then when the London Times was a
*  good newspaper, and it was reported by the BBC on Panorama by the, I can't remember his name now.
*  I have a terrible short-term memory. I was just reading his piece last night where he's having
*  the conversation with Golda Meir. He sent her a dozen or two or three red roses every time before
*  he went to Israel. And she really appreciated that. So she'd give him the first interview
*  whenever he was there. This time she wouldn't give it to him. She said, I have to give it to
*  the Americans. I'm sorry. And he just sent her the roses and everything. Anyway, he did talk to her
*  on the telephone. And he reported this in that article in the London Times and on Panorama.
*  He asked her point blank, would you use the Samson option? I don't think he used that phrase. He said,
*  would you use a nuclear weapon if Israel's existence were in question without batting an eye?
*  She said, of course. And he said, you understand what that means? And she said, yes. Now, was that
*  for public consumption so that people would understand that Israel was serious about winning
*  this conflict? A conflict they started. The Egyptians didn't start the 73 war.
*  Yeah, I know. That's another myth they peddled. Yeah. But I do think that Netanyahu, if his back
*  was to the wall and he were forced to do so, the big question, of course, that was being asked
*  was, even if you knew you would be taking the world into a nuclear holocaust, would you still do it?
*  Yes. I mean, how much damage do you think Iran can inflict on Israel? Israel is a small country. I
*  think it has a population of six million. What does Iran have? 90 million? I mean, I can't remember.
*  It's big. You're talking about between the river and the sea, about 14 million Israeli citizens,
*  seven million plus are Palestinian and seven million, not quite as much, are Jews.
*  Very small, not as small as Gaza, no bigger than the Greater London,
*  are smaller than Greater London. Gaza is where they're dropping all that ordinance. Just
*  putting the military template on it and saying how many casualties have been that ordinance,
*  that concrete, that rebar, those streets, those buildings, the template puts down on the terrain
*  and says, with great accuracy, how many casualties? It's 200,000. Guarantee it's not 40 or 50,000.
*  The template says it's well north of 100,000. We'll not know because you won't find some of
*  these people. They're buried so deeply under rubble. If Israel were to really be attacked
*  by the full weight of Iran, it would be a nightmare for Israel. It's becoming that way
*  just with Hezbollah. You're never going to get those Israelis to go back to their homes.
*  They're going to evacuate Israel eventually. I was told the other day by a friend in Tel Aviv
*  that already by his count, a million Jewish Israelis have departed.
*  Will they be back? Since October 7th, yeah, that's numbers they've hidden, but I've heard 500,000,
*  but certainly a significant number have just left the country. These are often the best educated.
*  They tend to be the secular part of society.
*  Putin was exercising his prudence and strategic verve by offering any of the
*  Russians who had immigrated to Israel, come back, we need you. You're our brain trust.
*  One of the things that just to talk about the Israel-U.S. relationship is that Pollard,
*  who gave Israel all sorts of intelligence information, he gave them information on
*  CIA and Russian assets, which allowed the Soviets to roll it all up. But he gave it to Israel,
*  and then Israel was giving it to the Soviet Union in exchange for the release of Jewish
*  citizens of the Soviet Union, but it obliterated the intelligence operation of the U.S. in the
*  Soviet Union. I'm told I learned this 24 hours ago. Pollard is now instrumental in and very
*  important to Bibi's propaganda effort with regard to Gaza and Lebanon. A traitor, and we let him go.
*  And Bill Clinton did almost as much damage as Trump in that regard with Pollard. Bill Clinton
*  pardoned Mark Rich as his last ignominious act in office. I think it was David Rothkoff or someone
*  said that was the most ignominious use of the pardon power by the president in the history of
*  the country. I think they were right. Mark Rich was a criminal.
*  You should explain who he was. Mark Rich really ran a huge company that sold, amongst other
*  products, discounted price oil to Israel and was responsible in large measure for Israel's
*  economic success under the finance minister named Bibi Netanyahu. And then later, as he became
*  prime minister, interrupted only by his fellow mate, Arik Sharon. Mark Rich made sure that
*  Saddam Hussein's oil in the UN oil for food program was stolen and shipped to Israel.
*  He also made sure that the pipeline in Syria, the one we were just talking about, was pumping to
*  Israel. And he made sure that eventually the pipeline out of Kirkuk, out of northern Iraq,
*  which has always had a problem with Baghdad, was shipping to Israel. So one of the reasons Israel's
*  neo- what do you call their system of capitalism? It's not quite what ours is, but they have more
*  billionaires per capita than we do. He made that happen with that discounted oil, that discounted
*  oil. And now look at what Netanyahu has done. He had inked an agreement with Lebanon for the richest
*  gas field in the Mediterranean thus far. That's abrogated. It's all belonging to Israel now.
*  There was a deal that Gaza had the second richest gas field in the Mediterranean for its own.
*  That's gone. He's got that too. 30 years of the future needs of Israeli energy are contained in
*  those two gas fields. He's got them both. Yeah, they're off the coast of Lebanon and Israel.
*  That's an important point that's often missed in terms of the occupation of northern Gaza,
*  because they need the coastline. Let's just close by talking about the institutions themselves,
*  the CIA, the Pentagon, which I mean, I'll characterize it, but you can correct me if I'm
*  wrong. These institutions appear hostile to a Trump presidency, especially the intelligence
*  community. How much can they damage, constrain, control Trump?
*  That's an excellent question. First of all, the intent has to be there and it has to be at some of
*  the higher levels in order to do that. I'm not sure it's going to be particularly because he can
*  take care of those levels if he wants to. But if it is there at the second echelon, so to speak,
*  or the second and third echelons, it can be disturbing of anything that he wants to do,
*  as it could any president. It can falsify intelligence. It can lead the president astray
*  with regard to serious national security issues. Right now, one of the most serious issues Trump's
*  going to face, I think, I'm no economist, but I know a lot of economists. They're telling me the
*  bond market right now is what we should be looking at, not the stock market. In fact, the stock market
*  is euphoric and for the rich. The bond market is saying Trump is going to have one of the worst
*  economic situations by midterm in our history. Our aggregate debt is also saying that. CBO released
*  a report saying it's $50.2 trillion in a decade, decade and a half. The interest payments on that
*  debt are already the defense budget equivalent, almost a trillion dollars. This year, almost a
*  trillion dollars. By the end of that period, the CBO looked at about 10 to 12 years and they think
*  they're being optimistic, it's going to be $2 trillion. It's going to be the equivalent of Social
*  Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense budget combined. We cannot sustain that under
*  anybody's rules of gerrymongering the financial system in the world. We just can't stand that.
*  And when the American people understand some of this intuitively and the crisis of confidence
*  comes with that understanding, and many are saying it's going to happen on Trump's watch,
*  he's going to have a real problem and he's going to have to retrench majorly. I don't know what
*  they're going to do. I don't know what we're going to do as a country when this comes to bear with
*  full force. All right. Well, that was Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson. I want to thank Diego,
*  Sofia, Thomas, and Max who produced the show. You can find me at chrishedges.substack.com.
