# The Secret History of Neoliberalism (w George Monbiot)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=see5c5Sgi14)
*  Neoliberalism inverts traditional social, cultural, and religious values. The market
*  is God. All will be sacrificed before the idol, Malik. This callousness has seen hundreds
*  of millions in the industrialized world who have been disenfranchised succumb to diseases
*  of despair, including suicide, addictions, gambling, self-harm, morbid obesity, sexual
*  sadism and a retreat into Christianized fascism, the subject of my book, America the Farewell
*  Tour. It has eviscerated the moral authority and traditional rule of government, reducing
*  government to a stripped down system of internal control and national defense.
*  Joining me to discuss the ideology of neoliberalism is George Monbiot, who along with Peter Hutchinson
*  wrote the Invisible Doctrine, the Secret History of Neoliberalism.
*  So let's begin with the book, which as I said before we went on the air, I mean you're a
*  journalist so you can write. And this idea of neoliberalism's anonymity, I found, I mean
*  I think you're right, it's accepted as sort of, you know, part of the natural order without
*  being questioned anymore. You write at the beginning of the book, to handle the greatly
*  increased scope and scale of transactions, the colonial nations established new financial
*  systems that would eventually come to dominate their economies, instruments of extraction
*  whose use has intensified and continues today with ever increasing sophistication assisted
*  by offshore banking networks. I want to ask to what extent neoliberalism is sort of the
*  next stage of colonialism.
*  Thank you Chris and thank you for that excellent introduction, which I thought beautifully
*  encapsulated the problems of neoliberalism. So I think in our view, Peter and I, we see
*  capitalism as a sort of foundational product of colonialism and we see neoliberalism as
*  the means by which capitalism seeks to solve its biggest problem, which is democracy. So
*  capitalism emerged as a form of colonial expropriation on the back of colonial looting.
*  I mean it's amazing, we have all these discussions about capitalism and most people in those
*  discussions don't seem to know what it is. We date it back, following the brilliant work
*  of the geographer Jason Moore, to about 1450 on the island of Madeira, which we see as
*  the first place in which Karl Polanyi's three pillars of capitalism, the commodified labour,
*  the commodified land and commodified money, all came together simultaneously and they
*  came together to create this extremely effective and virulent new colonial frontier, which
*  burnt through resources, burnt through human labour with unprecedented speed, created a
*  great deal of profit and then ecological collapse followed by abandonment. And that then became
*  the model which was followed. The Portuguese moved from Madeira to São Tomé, did exactly
*  the same there, coast to Brazil, worked their way up through the ecosystems of coastal Brazil,
*  trashing them one after another, destroying huge numbers of lives through slavery, through
*  murder, moved into the Caribbean, started doing something very similar there, whereupon
*  they'd been joined by other European nations doing the same thing. This thing called capitalism,
*  is often mistaken for commerce, which is just buying and selling things. And sure, there
*  are elements of commerce in capitalism, but it is absolutely not the same thing. Commerce
*  goes back thousands of years, capitalism goes back hundreds of years. And it is an extremely
*  coercive, destructive, exploitative mode of economic organisation. And then about 150
*  it runs into a problem, which is that larger numbers of adults got the vote. And when adults
*  get the vote, they have the temerity to say, actually, we don't want to just be commodified
*  labour anymore, we'd like to have some labour rights. We want to be able to organise our own
*  labour, we want to get a bigger share of the value that we create. We want outrageous things
*  like the weekend. And oh, and by the way, we quite like nice homes as well. And we don't
*  want our air to be polluted and our rivers to be poisoned. We'd like to eat better food,
*  whatever it might be, all these demands are inimical to capitalism. So ever since adults
*  began to get the vote in large numbers, people sought to solve that problem. And one means of
*  solving it is fascism. And fascism can be a highly effective means of solving the problem of
*  democracy. But then when fascism collapsed in Europe in 1945, they had to find another means,
*  and that means was neoliberalism. And neoliberalism turns out to be a highly effective way of solving
*  the problem of democracy. Well, let me ask about unions, because, you know, certainly within the
*  United States, but then also the union movement in the UK and in France were extremely important
*  in pushing back against the more rapacious characteristics that you just talked about in
*  capitalism. Yeah, so, so an absolutely fundamental idea in neoliberalism is that unions are against
*  the natural order. You spoke very well in your introduction about the way in which neoliberalism
*  tries to describe itself as a kind of natural law, like gravity or evolution. It's just something
*  that is there, not something that was invented by people. It's not a human made system. It's
*  just the way that we are bound to interact with each other. But of course, it's nothing of the
*  kind. I mean, what neoliberalism involves is the stripping away of all impediments to capital,
*  of the means by which the rich can make themselves even richer, however they wish to do so,
*  and at whatever cost to human beings and the living world. And of course, one of the main
*  impediments to capital is unions, because what unions want is for the workers to get a larger
*  share of the value which they produce, rather than seeing themselves completely exploited,
*  and their production seized by someone else. And so, from the very outset, with the work of
*  Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises in 1944, their respective books, The Road to Serfdom and
*  Bureaucracy, we saw the start of the attack, the concerted attack on trade unions. And within three
*  years, by 1947, with the formation of the Mont Pelerin Society, we saw the development of what's
*  been described as a neoliberal international, an international network of organisations supported
*  by some of the richest people in the world. Extremely powerful bosses and the corporations
*  they ran, pouring money into this. And one of their primary aims was to crush collective bargaining
*  and trade union organisation. And over the years, especially when their favoured politicians
*  came to power by fair means or foul, Auguste Pinochet, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan,
*  trade unions were duly crushed. Let's go back to Hayek and these figures. David Harvey, in his book,
*  Brief History of Neoliberalism, argues that the ruling elites understood, and these were
*  figures like Hayek were considered by many economists, certainly Keynesians, to be
*  third-rate economists. They didn't take them that seriously. Harvey argues that the ruling
*  business elites understood the deficits that were inherent within the economic policies,
*  but embraced it because it essentially justified or gave an ideological cover to this neoliberal
*  project. Do you agree? Yes. And it's very interesting to see the way that in turn Hayek then
*  went on to embrace his new sponsors. Because that book, The Road to Serfdom, I mean, you can see
*  it's obvious flaws. I mean, it's one gigantic slippery slope fallacy. It's effectively saying,
*  you know, if there's any move towards protecting populations as a whole, towards the redistribution
*  of wealth, towards the creation of robust public services and an economic safety net, that will
*  inevitably lead to totalitarianism. You'll end up with Stalin. You'll end up with Hitler. I mean,
*  it's just logical fallacies the whole way through. It's a philosophical nonsense, but they were very
*  happy to embrace it because it served them. But then what was really interesting was the way that
*  process happened in reverse, where Hayek then embraced the demands of his super-rich sponsors.
*  By the time he came to write The Constitution of Liberty, his book published in 1960, his doctrine
*  had really gone from a flawed, if honest, discourse on economics and politics to an
*  absolute confidence trick. It was just a scam. I mean, The Constitution of Liberty is completely
*  mad. I mean, it's a totally crazy book. You cannot read it without worrying for the guy's mental
*  state. But actually, what's happened is not that Hayek had lost it, is that he was telling these
*  very rich people exactly what they wanted to hear. And what he was saying was, it doesn't matter how
*  you made your wealth, because you are rich, you are a fantastic guy. You are a brilliant person.
*  And the people who have become rich, whether they inherited it, whether they stole it, however they
*  acquired that money, they are the scouts whom the rest of society should follow. Because wherever
*  they go, that is going to be a fantastic route to take. And we must go down that path, whatever it
*  may be. And he dropped his opposition to things like monopolies. He overtly said, we've just got
*  to exploit and destroy the natural world, extract as much money as we can from it, and then reinvest
*  it elsewhere. And it doesn't matter what damage we do. I mean, crazy proposition after crazy
*  proposition, but this was what was being fed back to him by his sponsors. And so the further
*  development of the doctrine was in direct response to the demands of that oligarchic class.
*  And embraced by figures like Margaret Thatcher.
*  Yes. I mean, one of the many anonymities of neoliberalism, because the neoliberals themselves,
*  they coined the term. That had been their word since the very beginning when they started to
*  discuss it in 1938, at the Walter Lippmann colloquium in Paris. They used that term into
*  the 1950s and then quietly began to drop it. And they didn't give any term with which to replace
*  it. They just said, well, this is the way things are. This is a natural law. It doesn't have to
*  have a name. And so we started calling it things like futurism and Reaganism, or we called it
*  monetism, or we called it supply side economics. We didn't have a name for it. And because
*  we were unable to identify its source, we were unable to combat it. And the story goes, well,
*  this is, you know, Thatcher came up with these ideas. No, absolutely not. I mean, there's a
*  fantastic story, which is told by members of what was then her shadow cabinet at the time.
*  And whether it's completely true or not, but, you know, we know that it's true in spirit at
*  the very least. But the story, first having cabinet members told is that soon after she became
*  leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, which was then the opposition in the UK, it was out
*  of power, Labour was in power. The shadow cabinet, which means the sort of group of people who want
*  to become ministers if they take power, were having a meeting about what is the true nature
*  of conservatism in our time. And they were all a bit pathetic, these characters, you know, she was
*  a very dominant, dominating character. And she came in late, picked up what they were talking about
*  and said, this is what we believe. And out of her handbag, she takes this tattered, bog-eared book,
*  almost unrecognizable and slams it down on the table. And that book was the Constitution of
*  Liberty. Let's talk about how, and it's interesting, by the way, 1947, because that was the Taft-Hartley
*  Act in the United States, which was the most devastating assault against organized labour until,
*  you know, you could argue NAFTA. So they coalesce, the global elites, the wealthy coalesce around
*  this ideology, which, you're right, essentially very swiftly becomes unnamed. And you write about
*  how the rich backers hired policy analysts, economists, academics, legal experts, and public
*  relations specialists to create a series of think tanks that would refine and promote the doctrine.
*  These institutions, many of which still operate today, tended to disguise their purposes with
*  grand and respectable names such as the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the American
*  Enterprise Institute, the Institute of Economic Affairs, the Center for Policy Studies, and the
*  Adam Smith Institute. I think these think tanks were important, as you point out, but also they
*  very swiftly took over, at least in the United States, economic departments as well. Yes,
*  indeed in the UK as well. Not just economic departments, but also the media. I mean,
*  you cannot have a discussion about anything which touches on economic life on either side of the
*  Atlantic without one of these rather sinister people being brought on to talk about it.
*  And in the UK, at any rate, they're never asked, who funds you? On whose behalf are you lobbying?
*  Because they are effectively lobby groups. The term think tank disguises a whole lot. I mean,
*  it's one of these many terms which is designed not to enlighten, but to disguise. And it gives
*  the impression that these are independent people who sit around and think about things.
*  They really don't. I mean, Hayek himself said that they should be dealers in secondhand ideas.
*  So basically, people like Hayek and von Mises and Friedman and others would develop the fundamental
*  ideas. And then what the so-called think tanks or junk tanks, as I prefer to call them, did was to
*  turn these often outrageous proposals into what sounded like common sense, to sort of make them
*  sound like things which were good for everyone, that they would be in our benefit rather than
*  being as they are. So devastating to society, to workers, to citizens in general,
*  and to sell them to the public. That's what these junk tanks exist to do. But also, of course,
*  they're whispering into the ears of politicians. Sometimes they're shouting, like Project 2025 or
*  the Heritage Foundation. But often they're doing so quietly and subtly. In the UK,
*  our most disastrous Prime Minister ever, Liz Truss, who lasted a grand total of 49 days before
*  she was effectively forced by her own failures to leave office, she was entirely a creature of the
*  junk tanks. Her team was taken from the junk tanks. All her ideas, none of them were her ideas,
*  they were all fed to her by these junk tanks, the Institute of Economic Affairs, the Centre
*  for Policy Studies, Adam Smith Institute, Taxpayers Alliance, and others like them. And she just
*  became their mouthpiece. She became their mannequin. And we saw the result, which was economic
*  collapse in remarkably short order. Although, of course, neoliberalism runs like an electric
*  current through every, at this point, in the United States and, I mean, now you could stomer
*  as well, I mean, in the UK. Obama, Biden, none of these people are challenging neoliberal policy.
*  Hillary Clinton. I want to go back to the point you made about language, because it's important
*  in Chapter 6. And, of course, what they peddle is this idea of freedom. And, you know, the free
*  market, they equate the free market with freedom itself. They've been very effective at doing this.
*  And you write freedom from trade unions and collective bargaining means freedom for bosses
*  to suppress wages. Freedom from regulation means the freedom to exploit and endanger workers,
*  to poison rivers, to adulterate food, to design exotic financial instruments, to charge exorbitant
*  rates of interest. It leads to train wrecks, both literally and figuratively, from the recent string
*  of toxic spill derailments in the American Midwest to the financial meltdowns and bank bailouts.
*  We now seem to have expected as an inevitable fact of economic life, freedom from taxation,
*  which by definition involves the redistribution of wealth, throttles, a crucial mechanism to help
*  lift the poor out of poverty, the freedom that neoliberals celebrate, which sounds so beguiling
*  when expressed in general terms, turns out to be freedom for the pike, not for the minnows.
*  Now, that's a very important point because, and we'll go back to the media, which speaks,
*  as we both come out of it, in soundbites and cliches and doesn't get to the point that you
*  just made in the book. So let's talk about their co-opting of language, which they have been
*  frighteningly successful at to mask the reality of what they're carrying out.
*  And then let's talk about the role of the media as an amplifier of this.
*  Yes. Yes. Thank you very much for raising this, Chris. So it's very striking how they have taken
*  values which we all support. We support the idea of freedom and so we should.
*  The freedoms we possess are freedoms which were very hard fought by our ancestors. Much blood was
*  spilt in order to ensure our freedom to speak, our freedom to vote, our freedom to organize,
*  our freedom from highly oppressive institutions and government practice.
*  And every freedom we have is something that people have died for and we tend to forget.
*  Even the weekend is a freedom that was very hard won. And the new liberals come in and without
*  being very careful not to specify exactly what they mean by freedom, picture and co-op this word
*  to make it sound as if the things that our ancestors secured and that we all benefit from
*  is what they're offering. Whereas actually they are intending the exact opposite. They are taking
*  those freedoms from us. In fact, it's very clear from a lot of neoliberal writing that they are
*  deeply opposed to the concept of democracy itself. This is what happened when Friedrich
*  Laich visited Pinochet's Chile and he said, I would rather have a political system which has
*  this economic freedom, which meant basically the freedom of the capitalist class to do whatever
*  the hell they wanted to people and anyone who got in the way was dropped out of a helicopter or
*  tortured to death in a basement. I'd rather have this economic freedom than what we call democracy
*  which doesn't have that element of liberalism. And again, liberalism and neoliberalism, these
*  are terms I've also stolen. There is nothing liberal in the social sense about neoliberalism.
*  It has taken away so many of our social liberties and it's this endless erosion
*  and misappropriation of language that alongside everything else we have to fight on a daily basis.
*  Let's talk about the consolidation of wealth, the funneling of wealth upwards,
*  which is the whole raison d'etre for the neoliberal project. Since 1989, America's super rich have
*  grown about $21 trillion richer, the poorest 50% by contrast have become $900 billion poorer. Why?
*  Because trade unions essential for securing higher wages were crushed. Tax rates for the very rich
*  were slashed. Regulations that big business viewed as constricting were loosened or eliminated and
*  perhaps most important because rents were allowed to soar. What is rent? The term has several
*  meanings that are readily confused. Let's talk about that because not only have they consolidated
*  wealth but they have accelerated exploitation, especially of the most vulnerable. I teach in a
*  prison so everything has been privatized in the prisons. These are the poorest families in the
*  country and their phone rates, their money transfer rates are exorbitant, far higher than you or I pay.
*  Let's talk about that with the consolidation of wealth and the consolidation of political power,
*  especially in the United States, which is at this point just a system of legalized bribery.
*  It comes with a turbocharging of what you call rent, or rentier in French. The economists will
*  use the French term often. Explain that. What neoliberalism claims to be is an entrepreneurial
*  society, but what in reality it creates is a rentier society because it has stripped away
*  the protections, the social protections, which prevent our gross exploitation by capital.
*  That gross exploitation in a monopolistic situation is effectively rent. Rent is the
*  unearned income you get from monopolizing an asset which people need for their survival or for their
*  well-being. A classic case you've just discussed of communications in prison. If you've got a
*  corporation sitting on that erecting a toll booth through which everyone must pass in order to
*  communicate, they can charge pretty well what they want for that. Everything above what could be seen
*  as a normal rate of profit, 5% or so on communications, everything above that is rent. It's just the money
*  that you can take because you are in a monopolistic position and there's no one to stop you taking it.
*  The same goes with privatized public services of all queens. In prisons, as one example,
*  here in the UK, our water has been entirely privatized and the companies which own our water
*  supply can charge exorbitant fees while investing as little as possible with the result that they
*  are instead now using our rivers as open sewers while still charging people through the nose for
*  the water that comes out of their faucets. We have no choice. We have to use the water. There's only
*  one supplier in each region of the UK so we have to go with that supplier so they can charge pretty
*  well what they want. There is a regulator which is supposed to limit that but the regulator, as
*  something happens with neoliberalism, has been completely captured by the industry. It is supposed
*  to regulate. That's another aspect of the neoliberal approach and everywhere we see
*  this tremendously ripped glass of oligarchs emerging out of the Romtier economy and using
*  their exclusive capture of assets, assets which the rest of us need, to ensure that we play way
*  over the odds to them in order to use those assets. That's mission accomplished for neoliberalism.
*  Those figures you cited for the transfer of wealth away from the poorer sections of society into the
*  hands of the richest people, that is exactly what neoliberalism exists to do.
*  And of course the NHS, the National Health Service, has been consciously underfunded
*  to the point now it's in crisis. Was it Thatcher who privatized your postal service?
*  So of course it doesn't work. I mean we have pressures to
*  privatize our postal service and you can talk a little bit about how these fundamental
*  institutions essentially collapse under the onslaught of neoliberalism because it's all
*  about profit. So they have set out to starve and destroy the National Health Service so that you can
*  end up with our horrendous for-profit health care system and within the industrial world,
*  of course in terms of indicators, we have arguably the worst or one of the worst health care systems
*  of all of the industrialized countries.
*  Yeah, yes, and this is exactly what the neoliberals over here envy and want to emulate.
*  They see this totally dysfunctional health system in the United States and say,
*  well that looks good. Why does it look good? Not good for our health, it's not good for the
*  people of this country, it's good for profit. Boy does it generate profit because again,
*  it's a tollbooth system. If you are ill, you need health care, you have no choice.
*  And if that health care has been captured by the private sector, you have to pay those fees to
*  pass through the tollgate in order to acquire that service and those fees will be far higher
*  than the value of the service itself. But because of course, you're weighing that up against the
*  value of your own life and your health, you will pay those fees if you possibly can, or your
*  insurers will pay those fees and we'll pay higher and higher insurance. Now, one thing the
*  conservatives have not been able to do, or Labour for that matter, is overtly to privatize the
*  National Health Service. That would literally inspire a revolution in this country. It is our
*  most treasured asset. It's a big part of our identity. I mean, the 2012 Olympics, the opening
*  ceremony was basically a peon to the UK National Health Service. We all love it. Thatcher ran into
*  enormous difficulties privatizing the water companies, the water industry, the railways,
*  the postal service, the rest of it. But even she balked at privatizing the National Health Service.
*  So what they do instead is to try to take it down piecemeal, death by a thousand cuts and subtly and
*  cleverly destroying services which are publicly funded until we are forced to go to the private
*  sector. And increasingly, a large number of operations are now being conducted by the private
*  sector because they've destroyed the capacity of the NHS to provide those operations by underfunding
*  it. Dentistry in this country is exactly where they want the whole system to go. NHS dentistry
*  has effectively collapsed in this country. It's almost impossible to get it now.
*  People cannot afford to have their teeth fixed. So they're making their own fillings and sticking
*  them in with super glue, overdosing on painkillers. This is one of the richest countries on Earth and
*  people are suffering massively because they cannot afford an absolutely fundamental aspect of health
*  care. Let's talk about the contradictory nature of neoliberalism because while it claims, as you write,
*  to promote free enterprise, you say it does two contradictory things at once. It valorizes and
*  fetishizes competitive enterprise while in reality rewarding and empowering the established wealth
*  that controls crucial assets such as land. And you see this. What it does is essentially
*  create monopolies, Silicon Valley, Amazon, and then these people, the last thing they want is
*  free enterprise. They want total control and they get it.
*  Two very indicative trends we've seen during the neoliberal era is one, the construction of
*  anti-bus laws so that we see mergers and acquisitions making companies bigger and bigger and bigger with
*  very dangerous consequences for society. As we saw in the financial crisis where banks that were too
*  big to fail actually failed, there'd be even worse if food companies go down the same route because
*  if they go down, well, you can't just create food out of quantitative easing.
*  There's enormous hazards in this. But at the same time, as they ripped down the anti-trust laws,
*  they raised massive intellectual property barriers. So in other words, they granted two
*  corporations huge and sweeping intellectual property rights, far, far greater than they had
*  before. Now, what's interesting about that is that it's completely against their whole claim to be
*  supporting free market economics, but neoliberalism has got nothing whatsoever to do with free market
*  economics. It's all about monopolization and culture and sweeping intellectual property rights
*  is all about monopolization. That's completely the opposite of freedom, even in the most basic
*  market freedom terms. And those two things in combination, and people often forget about
*  the way that intellectual property rights have changed, because those two things in combination
*  are really important. The shift in the IP regime has to a large extent driven the desire for new
*  mergers and acquisitions, because in taking over other companies, you take over their IP as well.
*  And then you can start to integrate these monopolistic empires, which ensure that you
*  can start building some very big and very lucrative toll booths. Let's talk about the
*  political effects. I know Tony Blair, as a young politician, was very heavily funded
*  by the wealthy and by the Zionists, which essentially allowed him to ignore the traditional
*  base of labor, which were the unions and the working class. But this is probably even worse
*  in the United States. But the corruption of the democratic process, I mean, to the point where
*  you have political philosophers in the United States like Sheldon Wolin arguing that the American
*  political system is what he calls inverted totalitarianism. But let's deal with that,
*  because it has had a very, it's deteriorated and destroyed many democratic institutions.
*  And then I want you to talk about what you do in the book about the relations, how it has affected
*  our relations with the rest of the world, neoliberalism.
*  So I think the first thing to say is that neoliberalism has permitted a kind of full
*  spectrum capitalism, which could be described as totalitarian capitalism, and that it penetrates
*  every aspect of our lives. Everything becomes monetized, everything becomes commoditized,
*  even our relations with each other. And I think there's a very strong link between the way in
*  which we have become monetized and self commoditized, and the way in which we have accepted this shift
*  in our identity from being citizens to being consumers, and the mental health crisis, which
*  is so salient in many rich nations today. I think we are all neoliberals now, to one extent or
*  another, and that has had really devastating impacts on our well-being. It has instrumentalized
*  our relationships. It has torn down so much of our social networks, our genuine social networks,
*  of our community life, of our trust in each other. It's made this mathematically impossible
*  promise that we can all be number one. Sorry, how is that possible? Sorry, no, only one person
*  can be number one, but we're told we can all be number one. And when it turns out we're not number
*  one, we get really angry, humiliated, frustrated. And then the Sareen voices of the far right are
*  calling to us and saying, there's a reason why you're not number one. It's those people.
*  It's the Muslims. It's the Jews. It's the immigrants. It's the asylum seekers. It's
*  the women. It's the Khans people. It's the Black people. Whoever it might be, they are stopping you
*  from achieving your natural destiny, which is to be number one. So all of these things
*  have major impacts on our intimate lives, as well as on our public lives, our political lives.
*  And of course, at the same time, the full spectrum nature of capitalism, as neoliberalism sweeps away
*  all the restrictions on capital, ensures that all parties, as you have said, become essentially
*  neoliberal. All the dominant parties within politics, Democrat, Republican, Labour, Conservative,
*  we're all neoliberals now. And that creates a generalized exploitative mindset. And so to
*  move on to your second question there about our relations with the rest of the world,
*  what has happened has been a recapitulation of colonialism. We have a new set of colonial
*  relations developing, broken primarily through the financial industry, the clever means by which
*  money is extracted from poorer nations and poured into richer, or not into the nations themselves,
*  but into institutions, exported in the richer nations, and then into the offshore domain,
*  where no one can touch it, no one can tax it, and then creating this new ruling glass of a
*  transnational, cyber-rich oligarchy, which becomes a kind of offshore state.
*  Well, you saw it with Syriza in Greece. So when a government rises to power that essentially
*  wants to challenge the neoliberal project, they strangle them financially and destroy them. And
*  in the end, Syriza became an appendage of the international banking system.
*  That's a very good talk.
*  You had a wonderful phrase. You quote William Davies, this is a professor at Goldsmiths College,
*  who calls about neoliberalism the disenchantment of politics by economics.
*  Oh, that was great. You also, this is you, you said neoliberalism is a political neutron bomb.
*  The outward structures of politics, such as elections and parliaments, remain standing,
*  but following the irritation of market forces, little political power remains to inhabit the
*  space between the facades. This is Sheldon Wolland. I don't know if you've read his work,
*  Democracy Incorporated. Let's talk a little bit about what you touched on before,
*  which you write about in the book, what you call the spiritual void. And I think that is,
*  again, as you mentioned, directly related to these diseases of despair.
*  100,000 people in the United States die every year from opioid overdoses. You have
*  all of these pathologies, which Emile Durkheim said were a consequence in his book, Suicide,
*  of what he calls anemone, this disconnection from society, and then these self-destructive
*  behaviours predominate. So it is poison, neoliberalism is poison in almost every aspect,
*  but let's talk about that spiritual void. Yes. So it's a question of the meaning and the purpose
*  with which our lives are invested. And this is absolutely essential to our psychic well-being.
*  Unless you think you have a useful role in society, and unless you think you have
*  some purpose which transcends your everyday life and your everyday interactions and your
*  getting and earning and spending, your mind will fall in on itself. I think this is what we're
*  seeing on a massive scale. And this disenchantment of neoliberalism, it disenchants us with everything
*  which cannot be measured in dollars and cents. Even the natural world now, there's this attempt
*  to, we're going to save nature, we're going to save the world's living systems by putting a price
*  on them. This natural capital agenda we see now right across the world. And of course, it does
*  nothing to save living systems whatsoever. All it does is to create a new frontier for capital.
*  But in doing so, it tells us these systems are not innately valuable. Never mind the wonder,
*  never mind the joy, never mind the astonishment of living in this fantastic natural world.
*  They exist purely to service and purely to service in instrumental and monetary terms.
*  And if we go with that agenda, and some people do, they destroy that relationship as well,
*  because they've instrumentalised it. And that sucks the spiritual marrow out of us. It destroys
*  something. It's very easy to put your finger on. You can't say, this particular thing has been
*  taken away from me and I feel this particular loss, because it goes beyond something that can
*  easily be measured or even easily be described. But it's something which I think is absolutely
*  fundamental to our wellbeing, which is the meaning not just of our place in the world,
*  but the meaning which transcends that place that the world reflects back to us.
*  Let's talk about chaos. You write chaos as the profit multiplier for the disaster capitalism
*  on which the billionaires thrive. In essence, and you quoted before Steve Bannon about the
*  destruction of the administrative state, what they want is chaos, because chaos increases profit.
*  Talk about that. Yeah. So I see there being two primary forms of capital. There's what we call the
*  housebroken capital, the domesticated capital, which will make some sort of accommodation,
*  grudging accommodation with the semi-democratic state or the nominally democratic state.
*  And then there's warlord capital, which says, we just want to destroy everything and pick through
*  the ruins and take what we can. And so if you look at Brexit, for instance, here in the UK,
*  I see that as a civil war within capitalism between those two functions of capital,
*  the domesticated capital and the warlord capital. And some of the warlords were very clear about
*  their aim. So Ian Hargreaves, a billionaire who was one of the main funders of the Brexit movement,
*  said, what Brexit will deliver is insecurity. And insecurity is fantastic because it creates
*  opportunity. Yeah, sure, absolutely. It creates opportunity for people like Ian Hargreaves,
*  but it destroys opportunity for other people. It destroys your secure job, your secure home,
*  your secure public services. It's the insecurity and the chaos on which such people thrive.
*  And this is why, when I feel we've seen this remarkable shift in the politicians that
*  capital supports. So a few years ago, almost universally, our politicians were really dull
*  and boring people. They were technocrats in suits and they were scarcely distinguishable from each
*  other. And this satirist I know here is complaining that they're almost impossible to satirize
*  anymore because they're all the same. They all look the same. They all sound the same.
*  And those were the people that capital had chosen because capitalism was at the time dominated by
*  the domestic, by the domesticated wing, which wanted safety. It wanted security. It was
*  primarily driven by corporate power and these big blue chip corporations. They have their five year
*  plans. They want a stable political environment. They want security. They want the government to
*  insulate them from risk. They don't want too much democracy either. Of course, they don't.
*  They want trade unions crushed. They want regulations reduced. But what happened was
*  that as a result of that and as a result of neoliberalism's attrition of public protection
*  and regulations, out of the corporate sphere, we saw this new onigarchic class emerging where
*  the owners and bosses were able to award themselves a larger and larger share of profit and become
*  extremely powerful in their own right. And some of those became the warlord capitalists who then
*  wanted the exact opposite of what the domesticated, the housebroken capitalists wanted. They wanted to
*  tear it all down. And so we then saw the emergence supported by those capitalists of what we call
*  the killer clowns, people like Donald Trump, people like Jair Bolsonaro, people like Boris Johnson,
*  people like Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu and people like Orban and Erdogan and Duterte.
*  All over the world, this very similar class of characters, these flamboyant, charismatic and
*  utterly chaotic people who surround the foundations of the state, who destroy stability, who rope down
*  security. Why? Because these are the people chosen by what has now become the dominant strand
*  of capitalism, warlord capitalism, to represent them. And so we can see that as a kind of mirror
*  of the way that under neoliberalism, the nature of capitalism has shifted to become something even
*  more rapacious than it was before. And they peddle, as you write, these conspiracy fictions
*  that tell people in effect that they don't have to do anything. They rob us of agency and that's
*  part of the attraction. If the problem is a remote and highly unlikely other rather than a system in
*  which we are deeply embedded, which cannot be changed without a democratic campaign of resistance
*  and reconstitution, you can wash your hands of it and get on with your life. And I often think of
*  figures like Trump as being more cult figures than political figures. But what they're playing to,
*  as you point out, is these conspiracy fictions which along with the idea that the deep state
*  or these nefarious forces are trying to destroy it, but there's also that sense of self-aggrandizement
*  and reassurance, you write, and freedom from civic responsibility. You see that at a Trump rally.
*  Yeah. So conspiracy fictions, I mean, people call them conspiracy theories, but actually
*  conspiracy theory is a theory about stuff going badly wrong. And we know that does happen. But
*  a conspiracy fiction is a story about a conspiracy which doesn't actually exist. That's what we
*  should call them. And Trump and Vance and many others peddle these conspiracy fictions precisely
*  for those reasons, because they say, I am your soul saviour. There's nothing you can do to sort
*  things out yourself. I will fight these vague forces out there which are destroying your life,
*  trusting me to do so. And they are fantastically disempowering. Those fictions, their whole purpose
*  is to disempower people. And that's why people like them. It's why they embrace them, because
*  actually a lot of people find the idea of involvement in political change, the idea of
*  political agency as being quite scary and frightening. I'm going to have to make a huge
*  effort. I'm going to have to talk to other people. I'm going to have to combine with others and
*  mobilise to create change. I don't want to do that. But here's this story telling me that actually
*  it's nothing to do with political structures. It's nothing to do with power. It's to do with
*  thoughtful people over there. We've just destroyed those people. That's problem solved. And so it
*  lets people off the hook. And a large number of people welcome that for the very reason that it
*  deprives them of political agency. Well, Hannah Arendt lists that as one of the chief attractions
*  of fascism, the surrender of moral and political authority. That was George Monbiot who with Peter
*  Hutchinson wrote Invisible Doctrine, The Secret History of Neoliberalism. I want to thank Thomas,
*  Sophia, Diego and Max who produced this program. You can see me or find me on chrisedges.substack.com.
