# How Paradise Lost Revolutionized the World (w/ Orlando Reade) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg)
*  There is perhaps no English poet. Christopher Hill writes in Milton and the English Revolution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=0.0s)]
*  as controversial as John Milton, the author of the epic poem Paradise Lost published in [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=15.3s)]
*  1667. Milton played a major role in the 17th century English Revolution that overthrew [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=21.1s)]
*  the monarchy. Indeed, it was said that Oliver Cromwell achieved power with his soldiers and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=27.26s)]
*  Milton's books. Milton inspired later radical poets William Blake, Percy Shelley, the anarchist [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=33.260000000000005s)]
*  Alexander Harrison. He was an inspiration to Thomas Jefferson, the French revolutionary [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=39.46s)]
*  Mirabeau and the Chartists and later still Virginia Woolf, CLR James, who believed that any great [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=45.86s)]
*  revolutionary had to be a great artist. Hannah Arendt and Malcolm X, who said that Milton and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=51.94s)]
*  Elijah Muhammad, who led the nation of Islam, were saying the same thing. Milton defended the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  execution of the King Charles I in 1649, something for which Samuel Johnson never forgave him. He [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=64.74s)]
*  was a passionate anti-clerical, embracing a host of Christian heresies. He was to his core a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=71.86s)]
*  revolutionary. He, like us, lived in a period that pitted two warring cultures. The ruling class, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=78.66s)]
*  as is ultra true for us, had abandoned traditional aims and values and wallowed in unchecked greed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=84.7s)]
*  and corruption. English society was gripped by despair and disillusionment. Milton wrote Paradise [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=90.7s)]
*  Lost, which is an account of human origins, to make a political argument. He was blind during [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  its creation, dictating lines that came to him at night. He had fallen from power with the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  restoration of the monarchy and he had been freed from prison and almost certain execution, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  only because of the intervention of the poet, Andru Marvell. His fight for liberty was lost, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=114.62s)]
*  his family was falling apart, his rebel in the poem is Satan, who seeks to overthrow God but finds [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=122.42s)]
*  himself cast into hell with his confederates and, as all readers of Paradise Lost have to admit, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=128.34s)]
*  it is the rebel who, if not the hero of the poem, is the most compelling figure, crying out to his [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=133.98s)]
*  banished angels, it is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven. Joining me to discuss Paradise [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=140.86s)]
*  Lost is Professor Orlando Reed, author of What in Me is Dark, the Revolutionary Afterlife of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=146.62s)]
*  Paradise Lost, and an assistant professor of English at Northeastern University, London. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=153.38s)]
*  Let's begin with a figure of Milton, and there is something I find very noble about. He is blind, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=159.78s)]
*  he's probably still living under the threat of assassination, he has been cast out of power, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=168.74s)]
*  he was a major figure in the Cromwellian Revolution, which everything he had fought [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=174.18s)]
*  for in his life has collapsed. And I want to talk about his, you know, what he tries to do with the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=183.46s)]
*  poem. We mentioned Christopher Hill's book, which I talked about in the introduction, who really argues [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=195.5s)]
*  quite strenuously that, although he was extremely erudite, of course, Milton, but it was more the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=201.86s)]
*  political experiences that he had endured that informed Satan and the contest with God. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=207.22000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. We can see Paradise Lost as a great work of art that, at the same time, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=216.02s)]
*  tries to rise above petty human controversies and is infused with Milton's world, with his life [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=227.78s)]
*  experiences and with the politics of the English Civil War and the feeling of defeat and of seeing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  the political project that he had devoted his life to come crashing down. So I think you're [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=244.38s)]
*  absolutely right there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=249.74s)]
*  And talk a little bit about that Civil War itself. An English society was torn apart. We should say [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=250.7s)]
*  that, although Milton, I think always, was a strong public defender of Cromwell, Cromwell himself [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=260.46s)]
*  became poisoned by power at the end and a pretty offensive or repugnant dictator. Just set the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=267.94s)]
*  scene, the political scene for us, and then we'll go into the poem. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=279.86s)]
*  Well, Milton had come up with the idea of writing Paradise Lost as a young man aged about 30 and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=284.1s)]
*  about 1640. And he seems to have known that it would be the great achievement of his life. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  And the thing that he was, you know, created to do, his poetic vocation was his highest purpose. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=297.06s)]
*  But when the Civil War broke out in 1642, he set poetry aside largely and didn't really write [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=304.74s)]
*  much beyond several short pieces for the next 20 years. It was clear from the start [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=310.58s)]
*  which side he would be on. He sided with Parliament against the King. To begin with, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=318.18s)]
*  this was a religious dispute. It was about the degree to which the King and the state [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=323.38s)]
*  would tell individual Protestants how to worship. But it developed into a political one. And Milton [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=327.94s)]
*  became, as you've already mentioned, one of the fiercest champions of democracy and opponents of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=334.02s)]
*  kings. After the King was executed in 1649 and a republic established in England, Milton was [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=340.9s)]
*  quickly offered a job. He served for the executive body called the Council of State. He was a member [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=348.26s)]
*  of that body and his task was to translate and write diplomatic correspondence. So he was really [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=356.26s)]
*  at the centre of or near the centre of power for a good 10 years as this English republic was born [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=363.06s)]
*  and as it founded and then later failed. So it's only around 1660 after the failure of the English [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=371.3s)]
*  Republic, after the death of Cromwell, the failure to establish a lasting democracy, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=379.62s)]
*  that Milton has the opportunity to return to his great work of literature. And it's after the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=384.82s)]
*  experience of being imprisoned and of being fined and of fearing for his life, he was released and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=392.26s)]
*  had to live a life of, I'd say, sort of public disgrace and enmity with the state, even though [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  he'd been permitted to go on living. It was in that condition that he wrote Paradise Lost. So they were, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  as he writes in Paradise Lost, they were dark days. He had fallen on dark days and it was [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=415.62s)]
*  in that state of darkness that he writes this gloriously dark poem which presents us with Satan [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=422.82s)]
*  who at the very beginning of the poem is himself recovering from a disastrous civil war in heaven. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=430.18s)]
*  Satan was an angel, led a rebellion against God, was defeated, cast out of heaven and falls down [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=437.7s)]
*  to hell. So at the beginning of Paradise Lost, the reader is presented with a failed revolutionary, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=446.1s)]
*  much like the poet himself and his other associates. So we must wonder whether Satan [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=452.02s)]
*  is a figure for Oliver Cromwell, whether the character of Satan contains some critiques that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=459.06s)]
*  Milton never articulated during his years working for Cromwell's government. At the same time, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=467.14s)]
*  the reader is presented with a figure of Satan that seems a lot like Milton himself, a failed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=473.3s)]
*  revolutionary recovering from a disastrous defeat and often articulating arguments against God, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=479.14s)]
*  who Satan calls a tyrant, that Milton himself had made against the English king. So the great [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=486.9s)]
*  mystery of Paradise Lost is trying to figure out why Milton gives us a Satan that seems so much [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=494.5s)]
*  like himself. Yeah, we'll go into that a little bit. I mean, the interesting thing is that in the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  end, Satan himself is not a very appealing figure like Cromwell. So one wonders to what extent [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=508.02s)]
*  it's not just a critique of monarchy, but it's also a critique of revolutionary activity. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=515.62s)]
*  And revolutionaries. Yes, it's often been read that way. And unsurprisingly, on the one hand, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=522.34s)]
*  Oliver Cromwell did become somewhat tyrannical. He started to dress more richly. He seemingly [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=529.94s)]
*  designated his eldest son his heir, which is a strange thing to do if you've spent your life [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=538.02s)]
*  fighting against hereditary rule. However, Milton seems to have genuinely believed Oliver Cromwell [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=545.06s)]
*  was the best man to ensure ongoing religious tolerance in England, tolerance for Protestants, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=551.62s)]
*  which is something that Milton... He wasn't too good to the Catholics. No, that's the limits of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=559.22s)]
*  tolerance in this period are... We could call them hypocrites, but they were so overt about it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=565.22s)]
*  However, sometimes Cromwell's statements about Jewish people and Muslims were openly tolerant. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=572.1800000000001s)]
*  He said it would be better that a heathen were tolerated than a true Christian persecuted. And [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=578.82s)]
*  I think he did walk that walk. To some extent, their passionate and violent enmity against [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=585.46s)]
*  Catholics was a political one because it was about being the subject of the Pope. But I don't [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=590.58s)]
*  want to defend the anti-Catholicism, which was pretty virulent at the best of times. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=596.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, and also, I mean, while Milton was a defender of liberty, he wasn't a defender of liberty for [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  Catholics. That's right. We always have to understand, at least in this period, that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=608.98s)]
*  claims about freedom are often claims about freedom for a particular group of people, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=614.42s)]
*  often freeborn male Protestant citizens. So the claims that would later resonate in later [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=619.54s)]
*  democratic revolutions were made in a more limited way in the 17th century. Nevertheless, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=628.42s)]
*  Milton's arguments about freedom did resonate and did resonate powerfully among Jefferson and so many [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=634.66s)]
*  others. Before we go into the poem, it was a time of radical ferment. You had the diggers, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=642.58s)]
*  the ranters, the early Quakers. And Milton was, I don't know if you would identify him with any one [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=649.14s)]
*  of those particular groups. But this English radicalism was fierce and strong and real. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=656.5s)]
*  The 1640s, after the downfall of the monarchy and the bishops, the end of censorship [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=666.5s)]
*  gave way to an extraordinary flourishing of radical literature in England for a good few [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=677.14s)]
*  years before Parliament swiftly reintroduced forms of censorship. And Milton was someone who [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=685.06s)]
*  passionately believed in the value of publishing heretical books. He passionately believed in the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  capacity to publish bad books in order that we can understand the good and the true. So he wasn't [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=698.26s)]
*  a leveler. The levelers believed in a far more radical transformation of society. Milton wasn't [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=709.22s)]
*  willing to go there. In that sense, he was more of the kind of bourgeois class with Oliver Cromwell, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=716.58s)]
*  who ended up taking control of the revolution. However, he did promote many wide-reaching [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=724.26s)]
*  reforms, social reforms, that today we could recognise as being radical and progressive. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=732.5s)]
*  Well, also theological heresies. He didn't believe in the Trinity. He believed [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=739.86s)]
*  that the soul died with the body. You can probably list a few more. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=746.66s)]
*  Although I think he considered himself a Christian. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=751.22s)]
*  Yes, although in some senses his heresies were so far reaching that many other people wouldn't [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=754.34s)]
*  believe he was a Christian. He wasn't a Trinitarian, one of the founding principles of [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=761.78s)]
*  Orthodox Christianity. He believed he was a Christian. He believed in Christ, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=767.7s)]
*  but he didn't attend church services, seemingly, after the Restoration and was certainly associated [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=774.26s)]
*  with radical Quakers around the time that he's writing Paradise Stars. People who believed in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  the inner light and were very sceptical about religious authority in any form. So his most [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=786.9000000000001s)]
*  radical, Milton, approaches something very anarchic indeed. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=796.26s)]
*  Hill writes that he reads Milton is carrying on a continuous dialogue with the extreme radicals, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=802.34s)]
*  and it became easier to see him rejecting with his intellect ideas which were familiar to him [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=811.22s)]
*  and which one half of his being accepted. Emsen, he's quoting, is right to suggest that Milton was [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=817.7s)]
*  in some sense aware of the terrible collapse that was always possible. He was not of the devil's [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=824.58s)]
*  party without knowing it. Part of him knew that part of him was. That struck me as an important [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=830.26s)]
*  observation in terms of the poem itself. Absolutely. I think to be a great poet is to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=837.7s)]
*  understand that one's sympathies and one's capacity to imagine are distributed among one's [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=843.94s)]
*  characters. And so Milton wouldn't have written such a good work of literature were he not able [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=849.7s)]
*  to spend so much time thinking with Satan, assuming Satan's perspective. And one of the very earliest [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=854.98s)]
*  readers of Paradise Lost noticed in a very disapproving way, I think, that it contained long [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=862.58s)]
*  blasphemies of devils. To read the first two books of this poem is to, first two of its 12 books, is [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=869.7s)]
*  to get very little other than what the devils themselves say. So it's no surprise that many [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=878.26s)]
*  readers have been shocked or seduced by what the devils say. So let's talk a little bit about the [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=884.98s)]
*  poem itself. I think its ultimate aim, it struggles to grasp the human condition, the nature of good [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=892.58s)]
*  and evil, the nature of rebellion. I read somewhere somebody wrote about Milton that it wasn't [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=903.3s)]
*  that he loved liberty so much, just that he hated authority. I don't know who wrote that. Maybe you [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=910.5s)]
*  did. I don't know. It wasn't. I like that. But let's talk a little bit about the, you know, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=915.54s)]
*  especially the beginning of the poem. I mean, it asks, you know, there's that, it begins, of course, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=926.66s)]
*  in hell and Satan is rallying his legions. There's been a ferocious fight against God, which is quite [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=935.54s)]
*  vicious, I mean, actually. And then the intervention of the Son of God. But maybe you can, you know, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=946.02s)]
*  set that up for us. Absolutely. So Satan wakes up, he soon sees his second in command, Beelzebub, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=952.58s)]
*  and they start talking about what they're going to do. Satan, from the very start, is insistent that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=959.94s)]
*  although they've lost the battle in heaven, that the war must continue. They magically are liberated [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=966.4200000000001s)]
*  from their chains. They were chained to the burning lake. Somehow they are liberated from them and they [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=974.1800000000001s)]
*  travel to dry land. And it's from there that Satan summons his followers. So he's led a third of the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=980.26s)]
*  angels in rebellion against God and they've all been cast out. Satan delivers this very grand [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=987.46s)]
*  speech where he says, awake, arise or be forever fallen. And his troops just having been stupefied [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=994.42s)]
*  and lying like him on the burning lake, suddenly they spring up and they start sort of marching [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1003.86s)]
*  towards him like a Leni Riefenstahl film of a Nazi rally. And Satan then says to them, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1010.42s)]
*  you know, we have to make this place our home, but also figure out what to do. They build this [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1017.94s)]
*  glorious palatial parliament building called pandemonium, a word that Milton coined, meaning [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1023.78s)]
*  place for all the devils. And in book two, so the second chapter effectively of the poem, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1031.62s)]
*  the devils debate what they're going to do, how they're going to pursue revenge against God. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1037.2199999999998s)]
*  And Satan presides over this debate on a huge ornate throne, which is not a very democratic [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1045.2199999999998s)]
*  thing to do, and in various other ways perverts the debate. Eventually the devils vote for his [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1051.86s)]
*  plan, which is to carry out a kind of guerrilla warfare against God, not by attempting total open [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1059.78s)]
*  war against God in heaven, but by traveling up to the newly created world and causing the new human [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1067.8600000000001s)]
*  beings, Adam and Eve, to disobey their creator and to pervert and spoil that creation. So that's- [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1075.7s)]
*  I just want to stop you there because Satan actually approaches Eve, and it reminded me, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1084.3400000000001s)]
*  and there may be other parts in the poem that I missed, but he seems to melt. I mean, there's, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1092.18s)]
*  it reminds me of the scene in Moby Dick where Ahab is talking to Pip, the cabin boy, and suddenly [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1098.8200000000002s)]
*  there's a tenderness on the part of Ahab that you don't see at any other time. And I kind of [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1106.3400000000001s)]
*  saw the same thing with Satan and Eve that I found really interesting before we go on. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1112.34s)]
*  Absolutely. That happens in one other moment in the poem, but in the moment you're describing [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1117.9399999999998s)]
*  where Satan sees Eve in the Garden of Eden and she's sort of, she's in a rose bush, she's tying [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1123.78s)]
*  the heads of roses to their stems, and it's just such a beautiful scene that Milton describes [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1130.98s)]
*  Satan as being stupidly good in that moment. And that's because Milton believed that the beautiful [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1141.06s)]
*  participated in moral goodness. So to perceive goodness, sorry, to perceive beauty for Milton [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1147.1399999999999s)]
*  was to become in that moment good, of course, very soon after Satan remembers his dastardly plan, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1154.02s)]
*  but in that moment he does melt and it's quite moving, I think. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1162.8999999999999s)]
*  Um, I mean, it raises the question of, you know, God who's omnipotent, why would God allow [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1167.7800000000002s)]
*  all of this to happen? But I don't know, maybe you have an answer to that. I don't. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1175.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, that is the question. That is the grand question of Paradise Lost. How can God allow [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1180.26s)]
*  evil and suffering and all of the bad things that happen as a result of the fall and Satan's [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1189.3000000000002s)]
*  ability to tempt Eve? That's the grand question and Paradise Lost is Milton's answer. And I think [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1196.98s)]
*  to summarise his answer very quickly, it is that ultimately the world that we live in, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1206.1s)]
*  this fallen, imperfect world full of suffering and pain and wars is still nonetheless worth living in [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1211.62s)]
*  and that we all on some level intuitively, or many people do, understand that it's worth [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1218.34s)]
*  living in. And so Milton's task in Paradise Lost is to remind us that the world, however imperfect, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1225.94s)]
*  is still something to want to live in and to be grateful for. But also, and Milton's Christian [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1232.5800000000002s)]
*  sort of conclusion is that it's worth living in also because we can get to heaven where everything [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1239.14s)]
*  will be perfect again. Well, there's two issues. One, of course, Adam chooses mortality to be with [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1244.98s)]
*  Eve. And then it seems in kind of the education that happens throughout the poem, there is this, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1253.46s)]
*  it's my reading of it, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to be that, you know, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1264.18s)]
*  paradise can be built internally within an evil environment. Absolutely. On the one hand, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1268.1000000000001s)]
*  at the beginning of the poem, Satan says the mind is its own place and can make a heaven of hell, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1275.7s)]
*  a hell of heaven. And that's not true for Satan because wherever he flies is hell. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1282.02s)]
*  But it is true for Adam and Eve when they're about to leave the Garden of Eden and enter the fallen [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1289.7s)]
*  world at the very end of the poem. The angel who's come down to prepare them says that they have a [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1294.98s)]
*  paradise within the happier far. So this internal paradise is going to be even happier than the, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1300.98s)]
*  frankly, somewhat vulnerable and anxiety inducing external paradise that they've been living in. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1307.54s)]
*  I do think that Milton believed that. Before we go into your book, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1313.46s)]
*  is there a kind of understanding or is Milton trying to impart an understanding [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1322.42s)]
*  that perhaps we change the world incrementally, that changes are small rather than these vast [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1327.38s)]
*  projects of social engineering that are embodied in incidents like revolution? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1334.74s)]
*  That's a really good question. I was just thinking earlier today how I believe this is a [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1342.34s)]
*  revolutionary poem, but it's somewhat absent of examples of fiery rhetoric, at least fiery [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1348.98s)]
*  rhetoric that is meant to get the reader pumped up. Milton wrote it at the end of his life where [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1356.98s)]
*  I think he was probably quite conscious of violence and of the downsides of violent [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1362.26s)]
*  radical change. He didn't in any way, I think, recount his views on democracy being the best, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1368.9799999999998s)]
*  most secure system of government, but he was perhaps more cautious about the kind of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1375.4599999999998s)]
*  violence that he was willing to subscribe to. So I think he was insistent that liberty was something [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1383.14s)]
*  to be fought for, as you say, through small acts, through humble acts. This is an epic poem, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1392.8200000000002s)]
*  but unlike the epic poems of classical antiquity, Homer's Iliad, Virgil's Aeneid, this is not an epic [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1398.8200000000002s)]
*  poem that spends much time celebrating the heroic deeds of men. It's not a macho poem, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1406.18s)]
*  it's a poem for which the most heroic acts are true to the New Testament, they're humble [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1414.3400000000001s)]
*  and often quiet acts of love, of forgiveness, and so on. So I think you're absolutely right there. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1421.8600000000001s)]
*  He writes the better fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom unsung, which sounds like him [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1429.78s)]
*  at that moment. But at the same time, there is a heroic triumph, but it's that of [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1437.8600000000001s)]
*  God and of God's Son in heaven. So the main warfare that happens in Paradise Lost is the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1447.06s)]
*  defeat of Satan by God's Son in heaven. At that point, Milton allows himself to, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1454.02s)]
*  you know, describe the full epic machinery destroying Satan's rebellion. But I think he [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1459.46s)]
*  was cautious about celebrating the grandiosity of men's projects to destroy each other. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1465.78s)]
*  He also writes, by small accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak, subverting [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1474.74s)]
*  worldly strong and worldly wise by simply meek. Powerful stuff. I went back to Princeton a couple [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1481.14s)]
*  of weeks ago to give a guest lecture in Paradise Lost class, and they were reading the passage [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1490.5800000000002s)]
*  in Book 6, in Chapter 6, about the war in heaven, and there was this line that felt to me so [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1499.3000000000002s)]
*  movingly relevant to today, or at least an idea, where God says, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1504.02s)]
*  War wearied hath performed what war can do. The idea being that the purpose of war is simply to [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1509.3s)]
*  exhaust everyone and to destroy everything until it's intolerable. And that seemed to me a statement [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1516.66s)]
*  of real, not cynicism so much as the absence of illusions about the possibility of just wars on [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1523.46s)]
*  earth. Well, the English Revolution was very bloody and very violent, and with the restoration [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1533.54s)]
*  of the monarchy, executions were very common. Absolutely. So the violence that Milton was [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1540.8999999999999s)]
*  perhaps recoiling from was, as you're suggesting, the very violent punishments of his former [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1547.94s)]
*  associates that were happening in London streets, very close to where he was living. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1554.02s)]
*  Before we go into your book, let's just talk about the end of the book, where Satan [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1558.26s)]
*  essentially tries to assume the posture of a deity, and what's the line, you know, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1569.94s)]
*  here's a hiss, everybody becomes a sneak, including Satan. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1579.94s)]
*  Right. Right, absolutely. So in a recent article for The Nation, I compared this to one of Elon [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1584.66s)]
*  Musk's sort of colonizing Mars projects, because Satan has proposed to go up to this new world [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1593.14s)]
*  to colonize it on behalf of his followers. And he goes up there, and he does what he said he would [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1600.8200000000002s)]
*  do. He convinces Adam and Eve to betray their creator. He comes back down, and his followers, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1606.98s)]
*  the devils, have prepared a kind of triumphal ceremony for him. He gives this great speech [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1613.3s)]
*  saying, this is what I've done for you. Get ready to take your place in this new world colony. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1622.02s)]
*  And he's met with a universal hiss. And that is, at once, a joke about how no orator ever wants [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1631.1399999999999s)]
*  to be hissed at by the crowd, but also that their punishment, that God has turned them all into [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1639.22s)]
*  snakes. Let's turn to your book. I mean, you open with Malcolm X meeting his brother. Malcolm's in [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1644.82s)]
*  prison. And he finds parallels between Milton and Elijah Muhammad. Explain how... I once asked [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1656.42s)]
*  James Cohn, who wrote a wonderful book called Martin, Malcolm in America, I said something about [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1673.22s)]
*  Martin Luther King being an intellectual. He said, no, the real intellectual was Malcolm. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1681.38s)]
*  Not that, of course, Martin Luther King wasn't brilliant, but the intellectual was Malcolm. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1687.14s)]
*  So talk about that moment, which you opened with. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1693.54s)]
*  Yes. Well, so Malcolm X was sent to prison when he was in his very early 20s for burglary. And [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1695.78s)]
*  he quite quickly, once inside, decides to take this opportunity to get an education. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1705.14s)]
*  He starts devouring books. He says, no university would ask its students to devour books, as I did [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1712.98s)]
*  then. He gives himself an extraordinary self-education. Then he converts. He converts [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1718.1s)]
*  to the Nation of Islam, this very unorthodox Muslim sect. And that only intensifies his desire for [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1724.8999999999999s)]
*  knowledge, but it also intensifies his scepticism about white writers, white history. And he starts [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1732.1799999999998s)]
*  to read the books, the literature that's available to him in the prison library [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1740.26s)]
*  in a suspicious way, trying to find out the hidden truths in them. So when he reads Shakespeare, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1747.78s)]
*  he says, well, I realized that Shakespeare's plays were written by King James I, who was the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1753.94s)]
*  same man who doctored the Bible translation. But when he reads Paradise Lost, I claim, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1759.94s)]
*  he does so in a way that is actually more attentive and in a way more illuminating than those other [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1767.8600000000001s)]
*  suspicious interpretations. He notices that Milton very frequently compares Satan to a figure of [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1773.7s)]
*  worldly authority. Often it's the King of Spain sending his ships to the New World to rape and [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1782.26s)]
*  pillage and colonize. Sometimes it's merchant ships sailing to foreign ports to trade spices [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1789.06s)]
*  and other luxury commodities. And I think Malcolm X understood that within those comparisons was the [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1797.3799999999999s)]
*  kernel of a radical critique whereby Milton was thinking about the satanic parts of his own world. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1805.86s)]
*  When he writes about this, he writes about it in his autobiography. It was 20 years [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1814.58s)]
*  after he'd encountered the poem in prison. So his memory of it is slightly hazy, but he remembers [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1819.06s)]
*  his conclusion, the one that you've already mentioned, that Milton and Mr. Elijah Muhammad [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1828.98s)]
*  were saying the same thing. That is that Paradise Lost is a critique of white supremacy and of [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1833.94s)]
*  European colonialism. And this has often been dismissed by Milton scholars as the zeal of a [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1839.8600000000001s)]
*  convert. But I think it's not only insightful about the poem, it also recognizes something in the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1846.18s)]
*  origin myth of the nation of Islam itself, which is fairly widely known. It's about this [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  black scientist called Yaqub. It's a kind of Frankenstein-esque myth, the idea being that [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1859.46s)]
*  black people were the original people. One day a black scientist called Yaqub decided to invent [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1865.78s)]
*  the white race and it was his creations that eventually took over. In one version of the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1870.58s)]
*  origin myth, Yaqub is in the capital of the original black people, which is Mecca, and they [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1877.3799999999999s)]
*  are then cast out. They have to go to this far-flying island, the island of Patmos. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1884.58s)]
*  They have to go to this far-flying island, the island of Patmos. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1889.46s)]
*  I noticed that in fact there were a lot of similarities between this version of the origin [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1895.06s)]
*  myth and Paradise Lost. So the young Malcolm X was in fact just making an illuminating insight [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1899.94s)]
*  in what we could call comparative mythology. He was recognizing the similarities there, but no other [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1907.46s)]
*  scholar or critic before me had looked so closely into Malcolm X's own intellectual life. As you say, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1914.42s)]
*  he was a genuine intellectual, but his readings I think have been often overlooked. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1921.46s)]
*  Well, I'm going to jump to the end of your book. When you and I have both taught, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1929.94s)]
*  I think you taught five years, I've taught since 2010 in the New Jersey prison system, and [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1934.1000000000001s)]
*  because of the particular social position that our students in prison are in, they see things we [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1940.1799999999998s)]
*  don't. I mean you can see that at the end of the book, even about Paradise Lost. You also will [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1948.26s)]
*  mention a great line you had in the book, which is so true. You're doing your doctorate at Princeton, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1956.26s)]
*  and you note that the people, the white men who built Princeton, also built the prisons, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1964.58s)]
*  and you're going back and forth between the two. Somewhat disillusioned, I would say, with Princeton [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1970.34s)]
*  University. It's a disillusioning experience to move between an elite university and a prison. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1975.4599999999998s)]
*  And for one reason in particular, I think, which is that neither group is more or less intelligent [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1984.98s)]
*  than the other. And so to teach both of these populations is to understand that some people [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=1993.86s)]
*  end up in prison, partly by virtue of where they were born, what group they were born into, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2001.3799999999999s)]
*  and others end up at universities experiencing all of the privileges of an elite social group. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2008.9s)]
*  And so in that sense, it can't help but relativize both institutions, both the prison on the one hand [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2018.02s)]
*  and the university on the other, and that I felt very strongly then, as I do now, that people in [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2025.22s)]
*  prison deserve the best possible education, and they certainly prove themselves to be worthy students. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2030.98s)]
*  Well, you're right about the intellectual capacity. The problem is privilege, as Shakespeare [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2041.22s)]
*  pointed out in King Lear, is a form of blindness. And the more privileged you are, the blinder you [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2046.18s)]
*  are. And when everything is stripped away and you have nothing, you can see. And there is, I found, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2051.22s)]
*  in the prison classrooms an understanding of how our society works, the nature of white privilege, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2060.82s)]
*  how interlocking institutions work to keep the poor poor. All of that is often lost on those people [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2067.46s)]
*  who have had the good fortune to end up, as you and I did, in places like Princeton or, in my case, Harvard. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2076.26s)]
*  Yeah, I did feel, after feeling quite disillusioned by Princeton, in my last year when I taught Paradise [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2083.38s)]
*  Lost at Princeton, I thought the students that I had were fantastic, and to some extent it redeemed [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2089.86s)]
*  the whole experience for me. But of course we want everyone to have the opportunity to have [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2098.34s)]
*  an excellent education. So in that sense, America, I felt, I came to feel, had been founded, to some [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2105.06s)]
*  extent, in the image of Milton's paradise on the one hand and Milton's hell on the other. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2113.06s)]
*  And of course we want to abolish such a bipolar way of understanding society. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2119.3799999999997s)]
*  The book is about how Milton has influenced a variety of people, including Thomas Jefferson, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2126.18s)]
*  but you mentioned briefly Thomas Paine, my hero. I did the Oxford Union debates on whether Snowden [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2131.2999999999997s)]
*  was a hero or a traitor. And I guess you studied at Cambridge, I don't know how Cambridge is, but [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2140.82s)]
*  Oxford won the prize for snobbery. It made Harvard look humble and contrite. And we all had to sign [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2149.38s)]
*  a big book that everybody who engaged in the Oxford Union debates had signed for how many [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2159.94s)]
*  hundreds of years. And I, in huge block letters, took an entire page to write, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2164.1s)]
*  never forget that your greatest political philosopher Thomas Paine never went to Oxford [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2171.14s)]
*  or Cambridge. But let's talk about Paine. So I'm just going to read this passage. One evening after [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2175.62s)]
*  that, I just love Paine's quip, one evening after that, Paine visited Adam's apartment to discuss [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2183.06s)]
*  their different visions of the American Republic. We should never forget that Paine was an [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2188.5s)]
*  abolitionist and a radical in a way that most of our quote unquote founding fathers were not. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2193.22s)]
*  Adams told Paine he didn't approve of his iconoclastic use of Bible quotations and common [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2200.1s)]
*  sense. He laughed and said he had taken his ideas in part from Milton. Paine had used Milton to put [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2206.8999999999996s)]
*  scripture at the service of revolution, which Eugene V. Debs did as well, by the way, grounded [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2214.1s)]
*  in Marx, but almost exclusively quoted the Bible. Right. Well, you have to speak in the vernacular [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2221.62s)]
*  if you want to convince people to agree with you, especially on questions of values, deeply held [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2228.66s)]
*  values. And so that's interesting. I didn't know that. I think of Paine in that moment as sort of [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2233.7799999999997s)]
*  admitting that to some extent he was cribbing from Milton, but also pointing out that Milton had made [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2242.3399999999997s)]
*  those arguments, that it wasn't so shocking that he had done so. John Adams also loved Milton, and [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2249.46s)]
*  so he should have known that in advance. But Adams was inclined to a slightly more kind of [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2255.3s)]
*  pomp and ceremony version of what a republic involved. So they were perhaps interested in [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2264.42s)]
*  different versions of Milton. On the one hand, the radical, low Protestant Quaker [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2270.9s)]
*  sympathizing Milton on Paine's part, whereas with Adams, the kind of grand, heroic, epic poet. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2276.1s)]
*  But I love that interaction. I found it in the founding fathers database, and it seemed that no [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2284.5s)]
*  one else had ever paid attention to it before. So that was a happy find for me. So you, this [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2292.02s)]
*  fascinating idea when you write about Jefferson, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2300.3399999999997s)]
*  regions, so you're quoting, he inserts these lines, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2308.74s)]
*  regions of sorrow, dull for shades, where peace and rest can rarely dwell. Hope never comes, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2317.38s)]
*  that comes to all, but torture without end still urges. These unattributed lines come from book one [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2323.14s)]
*  of Paradise Lost, and the dark ecology of Milton's poem gives words for the hell of slavery. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2328.18s)]
*  Equiano alludes to Milton three more times, but without ever mentioning him by name. Did Equiano [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2335.14s)]
*  see a connection between Caribbean slavery and Milton's fallen angels? Like them, African slaves [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2340.2599999999998s)]
*  have been exiled from their home and cast into a terrible dungeon. But Equiano surely would not [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2346.8999999999996s)]
*  have compared African slaves to devils. Thus, perhaps, is one reason Equiano doesn't mention [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2352.8199999999997s)]
*  the source of the lines. Whatever the intention, this ambiguous moment invites us to recognize [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2357.94s)]
*  something about Paradise Lost that many readers before and since have overlooked, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2363.14s)]
*  the fallen angels are slaves. I'm still sort of surprised that this hasn't received more attention. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2368.18s)]
*  So referring there to Oluwuda Equiano, the pioneering abolitionist, African born, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2376.7400000000002s)]
*  formerly enslaved man who wrote this very influential autobiography called The Interesting [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2385.38s)]
*  Narrative of Oluwuda Equiano, where he quotes Paradise Lost a number of times, each time [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2393.38s)]
*  comparing the condition of enslaved people in the Caribbean to slaves, which raises the question, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2400.34s)]
*  did he sympathize with Satan, as William Blake suggests we all should, and what he did, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2406.5s)]
*  in that passage I argue that it's unlikely that Equiano did. However, he does seem to have [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2415.7s)]
*  recognized something that is true of Milton's poem, which is that the fallen angels are slaves. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2420.8199999999997s)]
*  Beelzebub in the opening exchange with Satan says, maybe we've been cast down to hell because we're [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2426.5s)]
*  God's thralls, and thralls just means slaves. Maybe having lost the war in heaven we have by [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2433.06s)]
*  ancient rite of war slavery been turned into God's slaves, and maybe we're down here to do some [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2439.62s)]
*  terrible work like gold mining, or the kind of thing that the Spanish were forcing their slaves [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2445.8599999999997s)]
*  to do in the New World. So perhaps Beelzebub recognized something that's true of Paradise [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2453.22s)]
*  Lost, which is that the fallen angels are slaves, which would make the plot of Paradise Lost and [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2460.2599999999998s)]
*  Satan's quest to seek revenge on God a kind of slave uprising. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2466.7400000000002s)]
*  Milton didn't have great sympathies with enslaved people despite how much he'd written about [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2474.26s)]
*  liberty. Nevertheless, all of these contradictory energies are running through the poem. Someone [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2480.34s)]
*  who celebrates liberty cannot fail to condemn slavery, and it's for that reason that Paradise [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2485.14s)]
*  Lost has such a rich afterlife among abolitionists. Let's talk about William Blake. Am I correct that [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2492.34s)]
*  Blake saw the deity like Melville as malevolent? Would that be going too far for Blake? In general, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2500.42s)]
*  I think you're probably right. In the famous quotation about Milton, he says [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2508.5s)]
*  that Milton sided with the devil, he was of the devil's party without knowing it, and when he [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2515.86s)]
*  wrote of God, wrote in shackles, which is confusingly seemingly an image of itself that [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2522.1s)]
*  is redolent of slavery talking about shackles. I don't think I fully understand William Blake's [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2529.22s)]
*  highly paradoxical theology, but I think he was certainly thinking about whether God was not [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2535.62s)]
*  loving but malevolent. Absolutely. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2544.8199999999997s)]
*  You're right. As one forsaken by God condemned to an existence of toil and suffering without hope of [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2552.66s)]
*  redemption, Satan's condition has evoked sympathy in many modern readers because of its own. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2559.8599999999997s)]
*  And then you go on and write, you know, even his ruin is heroic. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2567.94s)]
*  That there is a, I'm not sure it's carried through to the end of the poem, but certainly at the [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2577.62s)]
*  beginning there is a nobility to Satan. Absolutely there is. Satan is ultimately a fallen angel [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2583.46s)]
*  and on that basis is heroic, his body has been created by God, he can't die, he's immortal, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2597.46s)]
*  and he is just like any of the other angels, however, he's beginning to rust and beginning [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2611.94s)]
*  to become corrupted to his core. So I think Milton wants us to understand Satan to be [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2618.58s)]
*  simultaneously angelic and increasingly degraded. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2625.54s)]
*  Let's talk about Virginia Woolf. I think you write in here that, well, let's start with [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2631.54s)]
*  Shelley's novel, which I didn't know, when Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2642.42s)]
*  which she gave an epigraph from Paradise Lost, but you say that Paradise Lost was a huge [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2651.7s)]
*  influence, which I didn't know at all. Absolutely. So Mary and Percy Shelley were [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2660.58s)]
*  reading Paradise Lost to each other individually a lot in the months leading up to [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2667.7s)]
*  the competition to write ghost stories that led Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2675.2999999999997s)]
*  So it's really just shot through with Miltonic language, it has that epigraph from Paradise [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2682.8199999999997s)]
*  Lost and most intriguingly, Frankenstein's monster actually reads Paradise Lost, the first [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2689.8599999999997s)]
*  monster that I'm aware of to read Paradise Lost and finds in Paradise Lost [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2697.78s)]
*  a mirror of its own condition. The monster is a very thoughtful and sensitive reader and is very [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2705.2200000000003s)]
*  moved by the description of the plight of Adam and Eve. You write about Virginia Woolf's relationship [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2711.2200000000003s)]
*  to Milton and you quote, I think you quote someone, I can't find it, that in her diaries [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2719.14s)]
*  or her notes are some of the best kind of critical analysis of Milton, but talk about [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2729.22s)]
*  the relationship between Woolf and Milton. Well, Woolf's father was Leslie Stephen, a kind of great [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2737.54s)]
*  Victorian man of letters who loved Milton as many Victorian men of his class did and would quote [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2745.94s)]
*  Milton ad nauseam. I think of him as mediating Virginia Woolf's relationship to Milton. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2753.62s)]
*  She was, she clearly understood from a very young age that Milton was someone to be admired, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2760.58s)]
*  but didn't necessarily enjoy his work and yet she prided herself on her ability to [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2766.66s)]
*  read the classics and understand them better than her brothers who had received the education that [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2775.54s)]
*  she was denied and prided herself on being the only person reading Paradise Lost in Sussex in [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2780.58s)]
*  1918. She writes that in her Bible, sorry not her Bible, in her diary, but then she finds out that [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2787.62s)]
*  one of her friends is also reading Paradise Lost and I think out of a spirit of competition [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2794.18s)]
*  she then decides to jot down her thoughts on Paradise Lost and it's an extraordinary [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2801.62s)]
*  series of sentences, I think a really wonderful analysis of Paradise Lost, also an extraordinary [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2808.58s)]
*  exercise in diary writing. She notes that Milton is the first of the masculinists, by which I [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2815.94s)]
*  take her to mean that Milton was reinventing a kind of patriarchal vision of Eden for the modern [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2821.94s)]
*  age, something and a patriarchal kind of heroic macho poetry that would be much imitated in the [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2828.9s)]
*  centuries to come, but she also says how smooth this poetry is, she recognizes its great aesthetic [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2836.1800000000003s)]
*  pleasure and then she says, and I think this is an extraordinary phrase, I can conceive that this [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2844.7400000000002s)]
*  is the essence of which all other poetry is the dilution and she wasn't wrong, Milton was so [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2850.1s)]
*  often imitated in the 18th and 19th centuries that Virginia Woolf's contemporaries T.S. Eliot [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2858.58s)]
*  and Ezra Pound felt they had to overthrow him in order to escape from Milton's influence. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2865.54s)]
*  Although I think you opened with a quote from, oh no, that's the Hill book, opens with a quote [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2873.7799999999997s)]
*  from T.S. Eliot, whose theological and political beliefs couldn't be further away from Milton, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2878.2599999999998s)]
*  but of course he's a great admirer. He was, he could only admit that when he became older and [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2886.42s)]
*  mellower I think, but his, and I write about this in the book, how much the modernists used a kind [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2895.78s)]
*  of anti-Milton rhetoric in order to articulate the novelty of their own work, whilst also writing [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2902.9s)]
*  poems that were often quoting Milton without admitting it. So it was a divided relationship [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2909.78s)]
*  but a very interesting one. CLR James, the great Trinidadian scholar, wrote Black Jacobins, which [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2919.1400000000003s)]
*  I taught in the prison. So he has some fascinating thoughts on Milton. Perhaps you can lay him out. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2931.22s)]
*  Yeah, how did he read Milton? What did he take away from Milton? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2950.66s)]
*  Well, like so many people, he first read Milton as a schoolboy and understood him to be someone who [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2955.46s)]
*  he, it was sort of compulsory, a compulsory admiration, but he also, like Virginia Woolf, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2960.7400000000002s)]
*  prided himself on being a great reader of the classics. He uses Milton amongst other people [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2966.5s)]
*  in books like the Black Jacobins for kind of throw away literary allusions to make jokes and to [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2973.94s)]
*  establish his own authority. But the work, the relationship to Milton becomes more interesting [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2980.9s)]
*  once CLR James becomes a really independent political thinker, a Trotskyite to begin with, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2987.86s)]
*  and then someone who established his own sort of tendency within the socialist movement. At that [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=2995.2200000000003s)]
*  point, he starts to think about Milton as being somewhat like a Stalinist, someone who had followed [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3005.78s)]
*  Cromwell just as CLR James' opponents within the socialist movement were remaining faithful to [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3011.94s)]
*  Stalin. But I think his most subtle and interesting account of Milton comes significantly later once [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3020.42s)]
*  James was no longer kind of active member of the socialist movement, but was an independent [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3031.46s)]
*  and international political thinker giving an interview to radicals in Montreal. And he says [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3037.94s)]
*  that he thinks that in Paradise Lost, Milton was offering a kind of [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3046.5s)]
*  submerged or subtle critique of Cromwell. And in that sense, I claim CLR James had turned Milton [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3053.14s)]
*  into himself, into a member of the anti-Stalinist left. But it's an interpretation that I think [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3062.3399999999997s)]
*  is both plausible, but also brilliant. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3069.54s)]
*  I want to end. We're going to skip the odious Jordan Peterson and his mangling of [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3073.7s)]
*  Milton along with just about everybody else, including Solzhenitsyn. I can't let Moby Dick [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3079.7799999999997s)]
*  go by. So we're talking about CLR James as this is you writing. He used Melville's, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3087.86s)]
*  Herman Melville's fiction, especially Moby Dick to identify a character in American politics, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3094.2599999999998s)]
*  a totalitarian type. In the 1950s, totalitarianism had become a fashionable, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3099.46s)]
*  term for liberals wanting to critique Nazism and Stalinism in the same breath. Hannah Arendt did [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3104.58s)]
*  so in her book, Origins of Totalitarianism. James used the term in a characteristically ingenious [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3110.34s)]
*  way. And Moby Dick, he says the totalitarian type is represented by Captain Ahab, who leads his crew [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3116.34s)]
*  on a suicidal mission to hunt a whale that tore off his leg in a previous encounter. Melville had [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3123.22s)]
*  recognized something, a special way in which America could become a totalitarian state, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3129.94s)]
*  the rise of a personality who in championing American values would lead America astray. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3135.94s)]
*  The final chapter gives an account of his detention, the spirit of immigrant. He was under [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3142.9s)]
*  the McLaren. He was thrown out of the country under the same act that they have used to go [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3147.86s)]
*  after the Columbia University. He was thrown out of the country under the same act that they [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3153.46s)]
*  have used to go after the Columbia University student. I had no idea. The same 1952 act, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3157.3s)]
*  yeah. It was written to keep out Jews, by the way. The spirit of immigration law is the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3164.26s)]
*  extermination of the alien as a malignant pest, while not as bad as the gulags or the concentration [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3169.54s)]
*  camps. This represents a form of totalitarianism latent in America. I mean, it just shows how [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3175.94s)]
*  incredibly prescient, especially given this moment, James was. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3181.54s)]
*  Absolutely. So it's a complicated passage that you read, but I think the thought is a [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3186.98s)]
*  fairly clear one, and that is that even though America is a democracy, that democracies have [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3194.82s)]
*  their own tendency to generate forms of totalitarianism. It's an obvious thought [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3202.82s)]
*  today because we've seen it happening in the last nine or 10 years in America. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3208.66s)]
*  When CLR James was writing about Moby Dick and writing about Paradise Lost, he'd seen it happening [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3216.2599999999998s)]
*  in America with McCarthyism. But I think James was describing a more fulfilled kind of [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3222.2599999999998s)]
*  totalitarianism, a more fulfilled kind of American totalitarianism that we're really seeing [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3228.8999999999996s)]
*  in earnest in its most fully fleshed out form under Trump. So it's striking that connection [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3236.9s)]
*  with the McCarran Act. And it just shows, I think goes to show that works of literature published [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3245.86s)]
*  50, 100, 350 years ago have an uncanny capacity to return and to speak to our concerns today. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3253.2200000000003s)]
*  Because they grapple with the same, I mean go all the way back to the Greeks, they're grappling with [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3263.7000000000003s)]
*  the same issues if they write with any depth and profundity that we are today. And in many ways, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3270.34s)]
*  I studied classics. The importance of classics was that, and Aristotle defended slavery, I'm not [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3277.7000000000003s)]
*  in any way or he thought it was a natural condition, but it gives you a kind of lens to then come back [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3283.46s)]
*  and look at your own society. And I think that's why reading these works are so important and why [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3289.7s)]
*  reading Paradise Lost is so important. Absolutely. It forces us to reckon with the things that change [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3295.14s)]
*  as well as the things that don't change. And unfortunately, I think one of the things that [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3302.3399999999997s)]
*  doesn't change is the psychology of the tyrant. Well, and the poison of power. Yeah. Thank you, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3306.2599999999998s)]
*  Orlando. Absolutely. Well, thank you. And I want to say thanks to Diego, Thomas, Max, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3317.3s)]
*  and Sophia who produced the show. You can find me at chrisedges.substack.com. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WqxMOfXYlg&t=3323.3s)]
