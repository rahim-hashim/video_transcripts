# The Secret Military History of the Internet (w/ Yasha Levine) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc)
*  Yasha Levine and his book Surveillance Valley, The Secret Military History of the Internet, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=0.0s)]
*  documents how the Internet, from its inception during the Vietnam War when its early prototypes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=15.44s)]
*  were designed to spy on guerrilla fighters and anti-war protesters, has always been designed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=21.12s)]
*  for mass surveillance, behavior tracking, and profiling. Its evolution spawned the massive [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=27.28s)]
*  private surveillance industry that lies behind tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=33.72s)]
*  which not only mine our private information for profit, but share it with the government. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=40.8s)]
*  The military intelligence agencies and Silicon Valley, he argues, have now become indistinguishable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=46.08s)]
*  We do online leaves a trail of data. Google pioneered this collection of our data for profit, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=53.44s)]
*  but it was soon copied by a host of other digital platforms including Facebook, Apple, eBay, Netflix, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=59.96s)]
*  Uber, Tinder, Foursquare, Twitter, or X, Instagram, Angry Birds, and Pandora. We are the most watched, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=67.28s)]
*  photographed, monitored, tracked, profiled, and surveilled population in human history. Nothing is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=74.12s)]
*  private. Our personal and business correspondence, financial documents and bank statements, arrest [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=81.4s)]
*  records, medical history, vacation photos, love letters, sexual habits, marital status, ethnicity, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=87.0s)]
*  age, gender, incomes, political positions, shopping receipts, locations, text messages, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=93.76s)]
*  school records, anything sent and received by email. This vast trove of personal data in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=99.92s)]
*  hands of corporations and security agencies such as the FBI and the NSA presages a terrifying dystopia, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=106.64s)]
*  for when the government watches you 24 hours a day, you cannot use the word liberty. This is the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=113.0s)]
*  relationship between a master and a slave. Joining me to discuss his book, Surveillance Valley, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=119.04s)]
*  The Secret History of the Internet, is the investigative journalist and founding editor of Exiled, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=124.92s)]
*  Yasha Levine. There were a lot of things I learned in this book that I didn't know. It's a great [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  history. And the first thing I didn't know is that this had its origins in the Vietnam War. So I want [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=137.76s)]
*  to talk about where we are now, but maybe you can give us a sense of the evolution of the internet [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  and how it was always tied to the surveillance state in the military. Yeah, thanks for having me [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  on. Well, look, I think a lot of people don't really realize that surveillance and influence, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=158.44s)]
*  these are features that didn't just come to the internet recently or even 10 years ago or even 20 [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=165.4s)]
*  years ago when this technology first started kind of gaining traction. These functions, these features [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=171.56s)]
*  of this technology were built into the technology. I mean, they were the reason why they were created. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=178.36s)]
*  To understand that, we have to go back to the 1960s and to the 1970s and really to a kind of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=183.72s)]
*  a new post-World War II world order where America was a global power. It wasn't the only power it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  was facing off against the Soviet Union. Communism was a perpetual threat to the foreign policy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=198.12s)]
*  establishment, to the business establishment of America. I mean, there was like the obsession, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=204.28s)]
*  of the Cold War obsession. But there was a problem in that a lot of the conflicts that America [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=208.04s)]
*  suddenly faced, especially after the Korean War, were not wars where big armies were facing off [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  against each other. These weren't like tank battles. It wasn't like troops marching in formation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=222.6s)]
*  or anything like that. These were smaller wars, basically wars of liberation, of third world [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  liberatory wars where local populations were essentially rising up against their colonial [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=233.56s)]
*  overlords. The U.S. was usually aligned with the colonial overlords of these countries or [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  backing them. These were puppet regimes in some cases that were directly backed by either the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=246.04s)]
*  old European colonial powers like France in the case of Vietnam or America itself in South America. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=250.84s)]
*  You have these populations, right? These are distributed populations all around the world. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=258.52s)]
*  They're fighting wars that are kind of specific to their location. A lot of the fighters aren't [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=262.76s)]
*  in uniform. They're actually part of the civilian population. They are the population. There was a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=267.4s)]
*  new kind of way of thinking about how to fight these wars. It was essentially a new doctrine, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=277.32s)]
*  a counterinsurgency doctrine that was emerging in the 1960s. It was the sense that you really [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=281.56s)]
*  can't fight these wars without understanding the population that we're dealing with. Why are [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=288.44s)]
*  they rebelling? Why are some people rebelling and other people are not? What can we do to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=293.0s)]
*  convince maybe in a soft way with aid or with other kind of economic programs to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=299.48s)]
*  tamp down dissent? If that doesn't work, what kind of more tougher measures can we take in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=307.24s)]
*  order to put down these uprisings? The internet came out of a very specific program that was [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=314.04s)]
*  initiated by a very new agency called ARPA, the Advanced Research Project Agency, which was [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=322.92s)]
*  actually ARPA started out as a kind of a pre-NASA agency that was then defunded and then reconfigured [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=329.48s)]
*  into a counterinsurgency agency under John F. Kennedy and under his administration. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=336.44s)]
*  And it was essentially let loose on the Vietnam conflict to figure out new technologies and new [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=342.12s)]
*  methods of trying to win this war in Vietnam. And so the agency did a lot of different things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=348.68s)]
*  For instance, developed drone technology to figure out how can we more effectively [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  surveil the jungles. It developed Agent Orange. How can we prevent the gorillas that are attacking [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=363.16s)]
*  French and American troops from using the jungle as cover for their kind of raids? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  And part of that was also developing new ways of studying the Vietnamese population, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=380.76s)]
*  its habits, its beliefs, its spiritual ideas to try to figure out how to pacify these people [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  using psychological techniques and things like that. And so ARPA funded all these [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=396.28s)]
*  anthropologists essentially to go out into the field and collect data. And [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  there was so much data coming into the Pentagon from that, that there really wasn't a way of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  keeping it in one place to make it useful. So that was one thing. So there was a need to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=417.64s)]
*  create data systems that could manage all this, what it was essentially surveillance data of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=425.08s)]
*  these populations, right? And to process it, to extract something useful out of it. At the same [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=428.84s)]
*  time, ARPA was involved in a kind of a surveillance system in a different way. It was trying to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  track the movements of Vietnamese fighters on the Ho Chi Minh trail. Again, they were using [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=441.79999999999995s)]
*  jungle cover to hide massive movements of troops, of supplies and things like that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=447.64s)]
*  So they were trying to develop basically like spy devices that could listen, that could be [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=452.84s)]
*  dropped from the air, that could listen to what was going on in the ground under the jungle cover, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=459.64s)]
*  that could even smell, that could even like smell human urine. If there were fighters peeing in the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=464.11999999999995s)]
*  jungle, it would detect the urine and send a signal to base and then that location would be bombed [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=471.88s)]
*  from air. So there are all these different surveillance things that was involved in, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=477.0s)]
*  that were very practical to fighting the Vietnam War. But at the same time, there were people in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=480.68s)]
*  America, in back of the United States that were thinking on a kind of a bigger scale, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  that were seeing, that saw America as its global power. And you really can't be a global power in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=489.56s)]
*  the modern age, overseeing all these different vast different conflicts without having some kind of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  bird's eye view of the entire globe, of knowing what's actually happening in the world. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=502.44s)]
*  What are people talking about? What kind of political movements are sort of brewing in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  the various different locations in which America has an interest? And so they started kind of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=513.88s)]
*  thinking about creating a, I don't know, like to use today's terms, like an operating system for [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=518.84s)]
*  the American empire, an information system that could collect all this data and that could provide [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  useful, meaningful information to the managers of the world. So it was like a kind of bureaucratic [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=532.68s)]
*  view of the American empire. And so these things essentially kind of merged together, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  these different streams merged together and they birthed the ARPANET and various programs that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  were associated with the ARPANET. The ARPANET was this network technology that could connect [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=552.4399999999999s)]
*  different kinds of computers together in one network, which information could be shared [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=558.84s)]
*  amongst them. That was one part of it. The other part of it was to actually create [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=562.92s)]
*  computers that normal people could use. So people don't really know, but the operating system that [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=567.56s)]
*  we use here, I have an Apple MacBook here, the graphical user interface, the mouse, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=572.36s)]
*  all these things, the menus, the dropdown menus, all these things were actually developed by the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=582.52s)]
*  military as part of the ARPANET program. So part of it was to create this network that could [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=587.56s)]
*  connect computers, but also to create a new type of computer that could be easily used by regular [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=596.3599999999999s)]
*  people, not engineers, because before this kind of graphical user interface that we're all used to, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=601.4s)]
*  computers were punch cards. You needed these technicians who would punch in data on these [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  punch cards. They'd feed it into these vast computers and then they'd produce some kind of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=612.5999999999999s)]
*  data. So they were more like complex calculators rather than machines that you could interact with, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=617.16s)]
*  that you could actually interface with in a natural way. And so that's the origin of it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=623.24s)]
*  The origin of the internet was about fighting insurgencies, about studying foreign populations, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  but also creating a platform that would allow America to run the world and to see the world, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=633.48s)]
*  to make it transparent. Well, let's talk about its domestic use, because it wasn't just used [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=641.0s)]
*  on fighters in Vietnam, it was used on anti-war activists in the United States. Yeah, I mean, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=646.12s)]
*  look, you know how it is. Anything that you deploy for use abroad, it immediately gets imported back [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  for domestic purposes, right? So almost immediately, this ARPANET technology was used to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=658.84s)]
*  ingest information about activists against the Vietnam War specifically. And what's interesting [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=667.08s)]
*  is because a lot of the research that was part of the ARPANET program that created the internet [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=675.48s)]
*  was done at universities, students actually knew quite a bit about these things, even in the late [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=681.96s)]
*  60s. Well, you talk in the book about, I think it was students at Harvard and MIT saw where this was [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  going and publicly protested. Yeah, I mean, look, it was interesting to me writing this book and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=695.88s)]
*  researching this book, because I went into the archives at MIT, at Harvard, and looked at various [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=702.2s)]
*  declassified documents. And what was amazing to me is that students from the Students for a [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  Democratic Society at Harvard and MIT had a more complex and sophisticated critique of [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=714.2s)]
*  internet technology or network technology than people did in the Obama era, right? Because I [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=723.1600000000001s)]
*  was writing this book at the tail end of the Obama era. And so people still viewed [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=729.72s)]
*  internet technology as a liberatory technology, as a democratic technology, that the internet would [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=735.4s)]
*  create this global democratic village. I mean, people still believed that back then. People don't [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=740.0400000000001s)]
*  believe it so much anymore. Maybe we can talk about that a little bit later why that is. But [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=744.28s)]
*  back then, not that long ago, people really did believe in the liberatory power of the internet. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=749.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, of course, the internet is owned by these massive corporations, some of the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=754.6s)]
*  wealthiest corporations on the planet. Of course, they work with the NSA, with the CIA, with the FBI. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=759.24s)]
*  I mean, the relationship has been intertwined from the very beginning. But people believed it, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=764.52s)]
*  right? People believed the kind of the marketing mythology of that these internet companies have [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=769.0s)]
*  pushed as part of their product. But in 1969 and 1968, when the first links were activated, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=774.12s)]
*  of the ARPANET links, the first nodes were starting to work together. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=783.1600000000001s)]
*  Already, students at these universities were protesting them. They were producing these very [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=788.36s)]
*  sophisticated pamphlets trying to educate other students and other people about the danger that [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=793.0s)]
*  these technologies pose. And they've said it outright. They said, look, these computer [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=798.6s)]
*  technologies, these network computer technologies that ARPANET is trying to create are tools of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=802.84s)]
*  surveillance. They're tools of political control. They're designed to basically pacify [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=809.56s)]
*  political movements abroad and are designed to pacify political movements at home. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=819.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, there was an incredible pamphlet that I discovered in the archives at MIT. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  And so because it was clear back then, I think, to people who were watching the emergence of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=829.88s)]
*  computer technology, that computers were linked with power because computers were controlled by [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=840.1999999999999s)]
*  major corporations. I mean, they were very expensive to purchase. They were very expensive [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=848.12s)]
*  to run and government agencies. So back then, people understood it wasn't an epiphany or [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=852.52s)]
*  anything like that. People understood that if you own a giant IBM computer, you're using it to crunch [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=860.04s)]
*  data. You're using it to crunch numbers. You're doing it to extend the power over the organization [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=865.0799999999999s)]
*  that's using it. It's an extension of their power. And that the only people who could afford to use [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=869.72s)]
*  these things were very powerful entities in American society. And so the linking between [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=874.92s)]
*  power and computers and control and influence was obvious too, I think, even in the mainstream, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=880.92s)]
*  in the American mainstream. I mean, you had like magazines like the Atlantic or something, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=887.24s)]
*  doing front page stories about how computers are agents of surveillance and control and things [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=893.0799999999999s)]
*  like that. So it was understood back then. And essentially, it has been forgotten. It was [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=902.04s)]
*  repressed this history or this understanding. And it was people who were propping and dyes to [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=907.56s)]
*  view computers in a totally different light, in a benign light, in a utopian light, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=912.8399999999999s)]
*  which was not the case in the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1970s. And even up into the 1980s, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=917.0799999999999s)]
*  people still viewed computers with skepticism. I think things started to change in the 1990s [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=923.7199999999999s)]
*  when things started to get commercialized. Well, you talk about that. And that was a very [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=928.92s)]
*  conscious effort to rebrand the internet. It wasn't an accident. But before we go on to the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=933.08s)]
*  commercialization of the internet, I just want you to talk about what it was these computer systems. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=941.08s)]
*  You talked a little bit about that in Vietnam, but let's talk about like the anti-war activists. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=948.0400000000001s)]
*  When I covered the war in El Salvador, they were using this system. And anecdotally, I heard that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=951.88s)]
*  they knew the names of every fighter in every single tiny guerrilla unit. They had charts [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=957.88s)]
*  and where they were from and this kind of stuff. But talk about the exercise of that knowledge and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=966.68s)]
*  power. I mean, look, there was a series of scandals in America during the Vietnam War era where it was [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=973.88s)]
*  clear. It was found out that the US Army was essentially running one of the most massive [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=982.12s)]
*  surveillance operations in the history of America. It's probably been eclipsed now with the internet [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=987.72s)]
*  because the internet just automatically collects so much data. But back then, to collect data, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=994.36s)]
*  you really needed to put people out in the field. And you needed to create files. People had to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=998.9200000000001s)]
*  really... Yeah, you need to have manpower to do this stuff. So they came up with... You probably [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1006.52s)]
*  remember this stuff. They posed this fake camera crews that would go and film, cover anti-war [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1012.28s)]
*  protests. And then they'd actually produce... So you write about this in the book. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1022.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But you also noted that they were sending all this back to... Where was [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1026.44s)]
*  it? The Pentagon or somewhere or the NSA? But as you said in the book, they could have just watched [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1031.4s)]
*  the evening news. Exactly. So essentially, the generals in the Pentagon had their own private [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1037.0800000000002s)]
*  TV network that was creating newsreels for them. But look, surveillance was happening. But I think [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1042.92s)]
*  there was a major escalation with this technology, with the ARPANET technology and the ability of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1050.1200000000001s)]
*  these new computers to ingest data and to make it accessible. That's the key, because you can have a [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1055.3200000000002s)]
*  lot of data. It's stored somewhere on paper or in these punch cards. And really, if you're trying to [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1061.08s)]
*  study some kind of political cell, let's say in Nicaragua or Ecuador, if you're trying to study [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1068.6799999999998s)]
*  those things, you really need to make it accessible to regular people who are staffing the Pentagon [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1075.0s)]
*  or the CIA. And so I think what was the major escalation with this technology is that you could [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1079.72s)]
*  take all that data that's being collected on, let's say it's anti-war protesters or political [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1085.32s)]
*  movements abroad, and you could ingest it and you could put them in essentially like an Excel kind [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1092.2s)]
*  of format, like a database where things could be collated, things could be related. You could create [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1100.52s)]
*  relational maps between various individuals, all these things. So suddenly, that data isn't just [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1108.12s)]
*  sitting somewhere and gathering mold in some basement, but it's actionable. So it's putting [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1113.72s)]
*  them at the fingertips of these bureaucrats wherever they are, whatever state security [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1118.5200000000002s)]
*  agency they're in. And so I think that was the escalation. And there were some scandals where, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1123.0s)]
*  yes, it was even covered on TV. It was a major scandal where there was even a whistleblower [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1128.44s)]
*  who notified the press that this new technology, this ARPANET technology was being used to digitize [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1137.64s)]
*  old surveillance data on anti-war protesters and make it accessible not just to the US Army, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1143.96s)]
*  which created, but share it with the FBI, with the CIA, with the NSA, and whoever, and even with [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1152.3600000000001s)]
*  the White House. So the ARPANET almost immediately began to be used to spy on Americans. I mean, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1157.48s)]
*  almost immediately. I can't remember the exact dates. I think it was 1972 or 1973. ARPANET came [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1166.68s)]
*  online in 1969. So just a few years after this experimental network came online, it was already [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1174.2s)]
*  being used to spy on Americans. Of course, the Pentagon denied it, said it didn't happen, that [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1182.44s)]
*  it was just an experimental thing and all this stuff. But the fact is that they did digitize [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1189.4s)]
*  surveillance data, illegally collected surveillance data, which the Pentagon was [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1195.16s)]
*  actually legally mandated to destroy. In fact, it didn't destroy it. It digitized it and used this [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1199.24s)]
*  network to share it with all the security state agencies. So from the very beginning, again, I [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1205.24s)]
*  think this is what's shocking to a lot of people who read my book is that this wasn't something that [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1211.48s)]
*  happened when Google emerged. This wasn't something that happened with Facebook. This wasn't something [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1217.16s)]
*  that happened with the NSA spying on us, as Edward Snowden revealed, tapping into all these [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1222.6s)]
*  internet giants. Surveillance was there at the origin of the technology. Surveillance [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1229.48s)]
*  was the reason why it was created. Just to give kind of an example, the first surveillance network [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1237.9599999999998s)]
*  technology was NORAD, essentially. So NORAD is this radar system that kind of watches the skies [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1247.48s)]
*  above the Northern Hemisphere or North America to watch for enemy bombers, specifically Soviet [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1254.92s)]
*  bombers, and to intercept them if they enter American airspace. That was sort of why it was [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1262.76s)]
*  created initially in response to the Soviet Union also developing the nuclear bomb. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1269.72s)]
*  So that is a kind of a surveillance network. So you're watching the sky, you're looking for [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1278.44s)]
*  people who cross the border or who are coming close in the sky or the planes that are coming [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1284.44s)]
*  close. And that is what sort of the managers of the American empire were hoping to recreate, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1288.6000000000001s)]
*  but on a societal level. It's an early warning system for political threats, essentially. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1295.08s)]
*  That's what kind of this ARPANET project came out of. That's the desire, that's the dream, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1302.52s)]
*  that was the wish, the Christmas wish of theirs, to create for societies what NORAD or air defense [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1306.6s)]
*  systems created for airspace. And so if you think of it like that, then kind of the internet makes a [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1315.56s)]
*  lot more sense because the internet has created that reality. We're talking right now on this [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1322.12s)]
*  computer, I have my phone here, it's always with me, it's tracking me wherever I go. It's a personal [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1328.12s)]
*  radar. It could be used to listen in on this conversation if it wasn't public. We're completely [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1332.4399999999998s)]
*  bugged. Everything like you said in your great introduction, everything that we do is surveilled. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1341.8s)]
*  Nothing is unwatched and things could be correlated. Even if things that you don't say, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1349.32s)]
*  things could be inferred from your actions. One of the things that even like let's say Google or [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1355.4799999999998s)]
*  Apple can even know that you had a one-night stand purely by the movement of your mobile phone. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1361.4799999999998s)]
*  It could infer a lot of things. It can refer who your friends are with, who you meet with. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1370.04s)]
*  It can map out your social networks very easily. We are fully transparent in that sense. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1374.6s)]
*  But that idea that Google and Apple and all these tech companies really brought into being with the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1381.56s)]
*  commercialization of the internet and the wide adoption of these technologies was there from [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1387.16s)]
*  the inception. Let's talk about that because that's a big moment. You commercialize the internet, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1392.36s)]
*  but you have to shake that perception that it's a tool of surveillance and that its roots lie in [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1398.68s)]
*  the military intelligence community. That was a really fascinating moment in the book where [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  in essence they rebrand the internet as part of the counterculture. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1416.04s)]
*  They rebrand the internet as part of the counterculture. I think that rebranding even [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1422.52s)]
*  began in the 70s really because there were actually people who were hippies who had long [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1426.04s)]
*  hair who listened to The Grateful Dead and stuff like that who were working as military contractors [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1433.1599999999999s)]
*  in places like UC Berkeley and a place like Stanford and a place like MIT who were reading [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1438.28s)]
*  Lord of the Rings or whatever, walking around smoking dope, but yet building the surveillance [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1442.76s)]
*  technology for the military. Even back then they didn't really see themselves as people who were [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1447.56s)]
*  doing a bad thing. They were just engineers who were creating a cool new technology. There was [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1453.96s)]
*  that aspect of it even within the military industrial complex because a lot of the work [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1460.92s)]
*  wasn't being done at the NSA or the US Army. People weren't wearing uniforms, the people who [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1466.92s)]
*  were creating the technology. They were engineering PhDs at universities. There was that aspect and so [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1471.08s)]
*  that aspect was essentially dialed up and expanded. I don't know if listeners know who Stewart [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1479.72s)]
*  Brand is. He was a really big figure really in the 70s and 80s and 90s and he was this pivotal [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1488.76s)]
*  figure who really helped almost like a doula or something. He helped birth this counterculture [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1495.4s)]
*  image of internet technology, bringing it, connecting counterculture of the 1960s and the [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1505.56s)]
*  1970s to the tech culture of the 1990s and beyond. A big sign of that is let's say Apple [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1511.6399999999999s)]
*  Computer. Apple's Computer's big ad campaign that it launched was all about fighting big brother. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1523.08s)]
*  It's kind of an iconic ad that people know about. Basically the way that Apple Computer was [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1530.28s)]
*  positioned was that by using this technology you could defeat big brother from 1984. There's [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1539.32s)]
*  another thing that I think helped create this utopian image of the internet was that right as [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1550.04s)]
*  this technology was commercialized and it was becoming cheap enough for people to buy, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1555.8s)]
*  America won the Cold War. Suddenly America was the global superpower. This American ideology, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1562.28s)]
*  American capitalism, this new kind of technocratic capitalism that began to be global in nature [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1571.0s)]
*  and there was nothing opposing it from any other side and it was victorious and it was dominant. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1582.28s)]
*  The internet technology was being pushed as this new operating system for a new utopian kind of [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1590.76s)]
*  democratic global system. That if you allow this technology to spread all around the world [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1598.92s)]
*  it'll create a global democracy, a global democratic village. It'll even make [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1606.0400000000002s)]
*  governments obsolete. We don't even need governments because people will decide things [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1612.8400000000001s)]
*  for themselves in this kind of anarchistic way. We'll just vote directly. We'll talk to each other. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1617.8000000000002s)]
*  I'll talk to someone in Bangladesh, in Russia, in China and we'll all be these perfect democratic [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  voters if we use these technologies. If we use these networks, if we use these computers like [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1630.76s)]
*  Apple computer or Windows or IBM or all these things, we use these technologies we will be [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1636.04s)]
*  able to create a global unified society. It's within reach. It's a really utopian idea. It's [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1641.08s)]
*  a beautiful idea I guess but what's unstated was that all these technologies are run by American [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1649.16s)]
*  corporations. Huge corporations that are not democratic, that have their own interests in [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1656.68s)]
*  mind and that these corporations are very much in bed with the American empire. They're [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1663.4s)]
*  completely intertwined with the NSA, with the Pentagon, with the CIA, with the FBI. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1669.0s)]
*  These relationships with some of these companies go back decades and decades and decades like with [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1676.76s)]
*  IBM for instance. IBM is essentially an extension of the American security state and had been from [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1683.08s)]
*  almost the very beginning. My uncle worked at Bletchley, breaking Enigma and then [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1689.6399999999999s)]
*  went straight to IBM because all the military technology, they built the first supercomputer [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1701.6399999999999s)]
*  at Bletchley. He went straight to IBM and they just commercialized everything. The military had [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1706.4399999999998s)]
*  done it at Bletchley. Totally, yeah. The computers that they built, let's say for the first air [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1711.72s)]
*  defense system, were these giant IBM computers. For the time, they were supercomputers that were [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1716.44s)]
*  housed in these giant, giant concrete bunkers that were nuclear proof. Yes, IBM was very much [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1724.6000000000001s)]
*  intertwined with the American security state. I just want to interject. They were also intertwined [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1730.76s)]
*  with the Nazi death camps, which you talk about at the end of the book. Yes, they were the Nazis. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1738.2s)]
*  They used the punch card tabulators to essentially find Jews and to more effectively exterminate them. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1745.16s)]
*  But also, IBM is intertwined with the Social Security Administration. IBM essentially ran [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1753.0s)]
*  the Social Security program. The welfare program, not the welfare but the pension program of America, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1762.28s)]
*  was all done on IBM computers. Really, IBM was like a privatized extension of the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1768.2s)]
*  New Deal and the post-World War II American state. I think the utopian rebranding depended on people [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1780.6000000000001s)]
*  being ignorant of actually what underlies the internet, what underlies this personal computer [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1788.2s)]
*  revolution, and what underlies it is American capitalism. Before we get into Tor, I definitely [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1795.32s)]
*  want to, because you write a lot about Tor, and I want to get into the fact that these [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1804.04s)]
*  tech billionaires now are essentially running rampant within the Trump administration. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1811.0s)]
*  But just talk a little bit about what you call the censorship arms race. This is the early 2000s, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1819.8s)]
*  because I thought that was a really important point. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1827.72s)]
*  Well, look, yeah. Because while on the one hand, the internet was being sold to [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1831.24s)]
*  American but also global consumers as this technology of utopianism and democracy, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1839.96s)]
*  America saw the internet as a tool of American foreign policy and American power abroad. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1846.2s)]
*  Because America developed this technology and as it was going outside of America and globalizing [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1855.32s)]
*  and being picked up in Europe, in Russia, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and in China as well, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1862.2s)]
*  America, the State Department, and CIA saw the internet as like a crowbar or something. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1870.0400000000002s)]
*  Essentially, if you could beam propaganda, you could use the internet to reach foreign [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1882.6000000000001s)]
*  populations in a way that you couldn't before. With China specifically, there began to be a [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1887.3200000000002s)]
*  conflict very, very, very, very early on in the 2000s about who gets to control your domestic [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1894.92s)]
*  internet space. China very quickly understood that the internet is a threat, that the internet is a [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1902.68s)]
*  tool of American power. If it didn't control its domestic internet space, it left itself open to [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1909.3200000000002s)]
*  foreign influence from America and to a kind of a destabilization, various destabilization programs [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1919.3200000000002s)]
*  to propaganda and things like that. So China began to essentially control what gets past its [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1924.52s)]
*  national firewall and to begin to erect this kind of defense against American, unfiltered American [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1931.6399999999999s)]
*  internet content. Primarily, a lot of these programs that are targeting the Chinese population [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1940.04s)]
*  were funded by the CIA or spin-offs from the CIA like Radio Free Asia and things like that. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1949.24s)]
*  So what that launched was America could not accept that. It could not accept that another [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1955.96s)]
*  country would say, look, we want to control what happens within our borders. We don't think that [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1962.76s)]
*  allowing CIA propaganda to just sort of target our population is good for us or is good for [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1970.04s)]
*  China. So we're going to have a kind of a censorship regime against the outside. So America could not [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1976.76s)]
*  abide that. To America, that was essentially like someone closing its markets to American corporations. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1983.8799999999999s)]
*  China would not allow Google or other American companies to operate freely in China. So [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1991.56s)]
*  the US began funding these kind of anti-censorship technologies. In the first iteration, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=1998.68s)]
*  the organization that was making these anti-censorship technologies, essentially [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2007.16s)]
*  tools that you could use to, that people in China could use, download to kind of go around the [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2010.84s)]
*  firewall. Initially, the main organization that was involved in that was Falun Gong, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2017.08s)]
*  which is this pretty crazy right-wing occult that's backed by the CIA that puts on all these [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2022.76s)]
*  sort of Chinese anti-communist ballets that you see posters for all over cities in America. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2030.12s)]
*  And this cult was creating these programs. But very quickly, it moved to a different organization. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2035.8s)]
*  And that organization was the Tor Project. That became kind of the major anti-censorship tool [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2041.4s)]
*  that America was promoting in China, but also in other countries like in Iran and then later in [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2046.6s)]
*  Russia. Okay, explain what Tor is. It became the lodestar for WikiLeaks and for, I don't know, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2051.56s)]
*  do you call them crypto-anarchists? These people who felt that they could evade surveillance through [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2061.8s)]
*  the dark web. I told you before the show, on Tor when I was communicating after the Snowden [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2068.2000000000003s)]
*  documents, which were housed in Berlin, there was communication between myself and them, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2076.28s)]
*  but they always insisted on doing it through Tor. Explain what Tor is. Explain what the dark web [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2080.2000000000003s)]
*  is. But as you also explain in the book, unless you are completely severed from Gmail and everything [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2086.6s)]
*  else, Tor, which I think by the end you make a very convincing case, was always a fiction in terms [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2097.16s)]
*  of what it actually was. But Tor becomes useless unless you completely sever yourself from all other [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2104.36s)]
*  normal internet activity. But just explain all that for people who don't understand [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2114.04s)]
*  what it is and how it works. I'll talk about first what Tor says it's going to do and then I'll talk [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2117.88s)]
*  about the history because I think it's very surprising about where the origins of Tor actually [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2124.04s)]
*  who created it and why it was created. So what Tor promises to do, you download, now it's like a [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2128.04s)]
*  special browser. It's essentially a different custom version of the Chrome browser. That [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2134.44s)]
*  Chrome browser has a special program in it that what it does is it kind of does the, what do you [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2141.32s)]
*  call it, like the three card Monte, you know, it's the where you comment on the street will try to [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2147.7200000000003s)]
*  play with you and you got to find where the little ball is underneath one of these cards. And so that's [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2153.8s)]
*  what Tor claims it can do with your internet traffic. It obscures, it shuffles it around, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2157.32s)]
*  right? Because, all right, well, if you just to, the internet is fully transparent in the sense that [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2163.88s)]
*  when I go to, let's say NewYorkTimes.com, right, I type into my browser NewYorkTimes.com, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2171.4s)]
*  that tells my internet service provider, hey, please request information from NewYorkTimes.com, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2177.1600000000003s)]
*  the servers that have that information. So my internet provider knows where I'm going, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2185.2400000000002s)]
*  what site I'm going to, what I'm requesting, right? And so who has ever watching my internet [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2191.16s)]
*  service provider, let's say it's the NSA or the CIA or the FBI or all three of them, know that, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2196.2799999999997s)]
*  hey, this guy is requesting information from NewYorkTimes.com, all right, or WikiLeaks.org, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2200.8399999999997s)]
*  right? And so it's transparent to anyone who's watching and to the company that provides the [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2206.2799999999997s)]
*  internet service. On the other end, right, my request is also transparent to the other internet [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2212.7599999999998s)]
*  service provider who is providing this information, right, that hosts NewYorkTimes servers or [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2218.44s)]
*  WikiLeaks servers, right? So NewYorkTimes knows, hey, there's a person from this IP address, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2224.76s)]
*  they're requesting this particular webpage, send it to them, right? So my internet activity is [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2230.92s)]
*  transparent to anyone who has access to data on the internet that the internet service provider [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2236.92s)]
*  has access to. And so what Tor claims it can do, and it does do it, is to obscure kind of the [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2243.24s)]
*  origin and the destination of your internet requests, right? So you request everything [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2253.3999999999996s)]
*  through Tor. So you request it through Tor and then Tor does this kind of shuffle with your traffic [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2261.7999999999997s)]
*  that no one really knows who you are, and so it sort of obfuscates your identity. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2267.3199999999997s)]
*  And it does do so. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2274.92s)]
*  You talk about how it became a big tool for drug dealers. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2275.4s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's another thing. Tor actually began to, you could host websites in like the Tor [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  cloud essentially, which was the dark web. So you don't actually ever leave Tor. So Tor is its own [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2285.72s)]
*  internal network essentially, and you never leave it, right? So if you request, let's say, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2291.88s)]
*  NewYorkTimes.com, it has to leave this Tor cloud because it has to go to the public [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2298.92s)]
*  website, internet, right? But your identity, your entry point and your exit point are essentially [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2303.88s)]
*  broken up. They're no longer connected. That's what Tor does. Or you could stay inside that [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2309.4s)]
*  and host a website inside that, and that was the dark web, and it became very useful for [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2313.4s)]
*  the pretty famous, yeah, the Silk Road, which is this big drug marketplace. The guy was caught, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2319.08s)]
*  you know, eventually, even though he used all these technologies. And he actually, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2324.04s)]
*  Trump just pardoned him and released him from prison. He was serving two concurrent [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2329.08s)]
*  life sentences in prison. Anyway, so that's what it claims to do. And it does do it on a technical, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2335.16s)]
*  textbook case. Yes, it does do it. The problem is that if you are using, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2342.28s)]
*  look, and if you're using Tor to hide some kind of petty crime, let's say, or you're hiding from [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2349.56s)]
*  the local police or something like that, yes, it works. But if you're using this technology to [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2355.56s)]
*  hide from the FBI or the NSA, it starts to fall apart. And it was targeted that it could do that. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2360.6s)]
*  It could provide protection from the most powerful intelligence agencies on the planet. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2368.12s)]
*  That's sort of it stated. You know, Tor itself did that, and the people who promoted Tor and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2373.3199999999997s)]
*  backed it claimed that it could do that. The problem breaks because if you are someone like [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2378.8399999999997s)]
*  the NSA, you are observing vast amounts. You're basically observing the entire internet in real [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2383.24s)]
*  time. And the problem with Tor is that you could actually time things. So if you're using Tor, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2389.08s)]
*  you could time things. The amount of time it takes to jump through Tor is actually predictable. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2393.8s)]
*  So you could say, oh, this guy's entering here now here, and then someone's coming out the other end [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2400.04s)]
*  a few milliseconds later. Well, we can correlate those together. So that was one way you could [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2405.6400000000003s)]
*  track people. Another way you could track people is that every computer and every browser has its [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2410.52s)]
*  own unique signature, which can also be tracked. And then there's just bugs that are going to be [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2414.6800000000003s)]
*  just bugs in the code that are not known to people that the NSA has discovered and that has [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2423.0s)]
*  kept to itself, essentially allowing it to unmask people that way. There are all sorts of different [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2428.28s)]
*  ways to circumvent this. But there is even a darker level to it, which I think makes it a [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2435.16s)]
*  lot more interesting. Tor itself, while it billed itself as this independent agency [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2440.84s)]
*  that was run by these anarcho crypto guys who hated the government, who had long hair, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2446.36s)]
*  who seemed to be against the NSA, who were helping WikiLeaks and all this stuff. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2453.32s)]
*  We're talking about Jacob Applebaum. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2457.88s)]
*  Jacob Applebaum and Roger Dingledine, who was also the head of Tor project back then. I don't [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2459.5600000000004s)]
*  think he's the head of it anymore. These guys were on the payroll of the US government, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2465.7200000000003s)]
*  and specifically nonprofits that were linked to the State Department and CIA spinoffs like the [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2470.76s)]
*  Broadcasting Board of Governors. It's called a different name now. It's called the US Agency [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2480.28s)]
*  for Global Media. They pick these names, man. You can't remember them. They're just gray, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2485.08s)]
*  generic names, and they keep changing them. But the Broadcasting Board of Governors back then [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2490.6s)]
*  was the umbrella agency that ran America's government propaganda news divisions. Everything [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2496.44s)]
*  from Radio Free Europe to Radio Free Asia and all these different language programs that were [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2503.4s)]
*  targeting the Middle East, that were targeting South America, that were targeting China, Vietnam, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2510.76s)]
*  Korea, Russia, Iran, blah, blah, blah. The entire American propaganda division, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2516.12s)]
*  the agency that was overseeing it, was also funding this supposedly [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2528.84s)]
*  anarcho crypto spunky outfit that was going to protect you from the NSA. Also, it had direct [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2533.16s)]
*  contracts with the Pentagon. The reason why the Pentagon was funding it, so all these different [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2542.04s)]
*  agencies that are funding TOR have different reasons why they were funding it. The reasons [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2549.1600000000003s)]
*  that the Pentagon was funding it was because I think it was being used by the US military [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2553.32s)]
*  actively. The origins of the TOR project were actually in the US Navy, in the US Naval Laboratory. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2558.36s)]
*  The US Navy is actually historically linked with surveillance and espionage. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2567.56s)]
*  I don't want to get into the details, but historically the US Navy was actually [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2574.76s)]
*  the driver of surveillance technologies and encryption technologies and interception [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2578.12s)]
*  technologies basically to intercept signals intelligence that was coming from ships [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2583.08s)]
*  out in the ocean and hiding its own signals intelligence from other countries. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2588.04s)]
*  The US Naval Laboratory developed the TOR project or the technology that underpinned the TOR project [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2595.64s)]
*  to hide spies as they use the internet. The problem with the internet is that it doesn't matter if [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2603.16s)]
*  I'm using the internet or if a CIA agent is using the internet or an FBI agent is using the internet. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2609.8799999999997s)]
*  We're all transparent to the ISPs that provide the service. If I'm a CIA agent and I want to [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2615.48s)]
*  infiltrate an animal rights forum or something like that, or I'm an FBI agent and I want to [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2626.84s)]
*  infiltrate an animal rights forum, I don't want the administrator of the forum to see that [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2632.84s)]
*  the IP address of the user that I created on that forum to be linked with an FBI office somewhere. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2639.72s)]
*  I want to be able to hide that. For an FBI agent to use the internet but to hide themselves in [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2650.84s)]
*  plain sight, they have to use TOR or they have to use something like TOR. It was developed [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2656.44s)]
*  specifically to hide spies online, American spies online. That was the purpose of the TOR project. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2660.92s)]
*  The problem with this kind of technology is that you can also see that if someone uses TOR, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2668.1200000000003s)]
*  because if you actually start tracing the IP information, you see that this user popped out [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2674.2000000000003s)]
*  of a TOR node or TOR cloud. In order for this American spies to use TOR, they have to open [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2679.7200000000003s)]
*  TOR to as wide an audience as possible, to as wide a user base as possible. Everyone from [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2689.1600000000003s)]
*  criminals to drug dealers to drug users to political activists like Julian Assange [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2697.3199999999997s)]
*  to soccer moms who are just paranoid about the government watching them or whatever. You want [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2706.8399999999997s)]
*  everyone to use it. That way the spies can hide in the crowd. It's like in the old Cold War [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2712.2s)]
*  movies or something. You do the handoff in a crowded train station or whatever. You go to a [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2718.2s)]
*  crowded square to do the handoff where things can't be traced as easily. TOR was created to [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2725.32s)]
*  hide spies and then it was essentially handed off to this strange non-profit that was essentially [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2730.6800000000003s)]
*  run by these nobodies. People who were involved with helping code peripherally this technology, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2739.8s)]
*  but there were nobodies. Suddenly it rebranded itself from a tool to hide spies into a tool that [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2748.04s)]
*  will help hide you from spies. It did almost like a 180. It's a very interesting story. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2759.32s)]
*  I don't know where else we can go from that or if this is enough because I don't want to [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2766.2799999999997s)]
*  get too much into the details. Just quickly because I want to talk about what's happening [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2769.96s)]
*  right now in the Trump administration. You argue in the book that TOR just ultimately doesn't work. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2773.16s)]
*  It can work. I'd say it can. It works on very low level cases if you're hiding from [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2781.64s)]
*  just local cops or something like that. Like petty crime. Let's talk about what's happening now [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2787.8799999999997s)]
*  because the Silicon Valley is now essentially come to power with the Trump administration. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2794.76s)]
*  Let's not forget they were all good liberals and Democrats until they weren't. What are they doing? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2805.0s)]
*  Talk a little bit about the AI projects. I think people don't quite understand [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2811.2400000000002s)]
*  what's happening before our eyes. Yeah. It's been interesting for me to watch this [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2819.8s)]
*  because when I was reading this book, in essence, all the tech companies that were [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2824.36s)]
*  active at the time, Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter, they really did not want to admit [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2830.84s)]
*  that they are part of the American empire. That they are completely embedded with the American [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2843.1600000000003s)]
*  state and especially with its foreign policy apparatus. They really wanted to maintain that [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2848.76s)]
*  fiction that no, no, no, no, no, we're just companies and we're operating on a global scale. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2855.2400000000002s)]
*  All right, yes, there's these contracts, but they really would not answer questions about these [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2861.0800000000004s)]
*  things. They would not answer about the relationships or the active contracts that they had with the [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2865.0s)]
*  department of state. Speaking specifically- And Israel, let's not forget. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2869.0800000000004s)]
*  Israel, yes. Israel was the quiet demon in the corner of the room. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2872.68s)]
*  Israel is an extension of the American empire, so it made sense that these tech companies and [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2884.36s)]
*  Israel are entwined. In fact, Israel is such a big hub for computer technology that Google and all [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2888.52s)]
*  these different companies would actually buy startups that were created by people who came [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2896.84s)]
*  out of Israeli intelligence and all this stuff. So there was the squeamishness about admitting that [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2901.16s)]
*  Facebook was essentially an extension of American power, that Google was a privatized extension of [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2908.3599999999997s)]
*  American power. Things have changed now, quite dramatically, I'd say. I'd say these companies [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2914.52s)]
*  are no longer squeamish about these things. They're out front about it. I mean, they're [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2921.08s)]
*  much more willing to talk openly about their patriotism, about how much they want America [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2927.16s)]
*  to succeed, and they are American companies, and they're willing to take American security [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2933.72s)]
*  seriously and all these things. I think it had to do with, first of all, the maturation of these [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2937.8799999999997s)]
*  companies. These are pretty young companies. This whole sector really became big. I mean, look, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2944.68s)]
*  it's no more than 20 years old, really, the economic power that these companies have. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2953.32s)]
*  And the change in American politics and the collapse of this utopian technological [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2960.44s)]
*  mythology, because I think it started to really turn during the first Trump administration, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2969.64s)]
*  and even in the run-up to the Trump administration. When I first saw sort of liberals, really, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2975.7200000000003s)]
*  and the Democrat parties start talking negatively about the internet is when they started pushing [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2981.0s)]
*  this idea that the internet is responsible for Trump's victory, for why Trump is so popular. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2985.72s)]
*  And not just the internet, but the fact that Russia and foreign powers are manipulating the [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2991.4s)]
*  American people into voting for Trump. And so suddenly, it really turned on a dime. Hillary [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=2996.84s)]
*  Clinton, as the head of the Department of State under Obama, spearheaded her whole main policy as [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3003.64s)]
*  the person in charge of the Department of State was the policy of internet freedom. So she said [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3013.4s)]
*  that, no, no, countries cannot control their domestic internet space. They have to let America [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3020.2s)]
*  in. They have to let American companies in. And if they don't let American companies in, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3026.04s)]
*  they're totalitarian, they're anti-democratic, they're thugs, they're against freedom, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3030.28s)]
*  they're against liberty, they're against everything that's holy to us as democratic people. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3034.76s)]
*  That was her whole thing that she was pushing in that position. And then, of course, when she lost, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3040.28s)]
*  she began to demonize the internet as this agent of chaos, as a dangerous technology. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3045.96s)]
*  Because suddenly, whether it was real or not, she believed that the internet was used to subvert [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3053.64s)]
*  American democracy. I mean, I don't subscribe to that theory, but that's what she believed. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3063.16s)]
*  So the internet started to be this agent of danger suddenly. And so American society itself began to [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3067.88s)]
*  view American elites, really began to view the internet in a negative light. They no longer [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3075.64s)]
*  believed in their own mythology. And so I think it started to really turn then. And because the [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3082.2s)]
*  foreign policy establishment and just the elites began to turn inward much more and began to be, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3090.2s)]
*  I don't know, the idea that America would fully control the world in this kind of global, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3097.72s)]
*  neoliberal American utopia began to crumble and collapse. And so the mythology started to change. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3103.64s)]
*  And so the American companies started talking a different way. Now, that's a little bit different [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3110.12s)]
*  from part of your question about what these tech guys are doing with Trump and with AI. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3114.68s)]
*  And I mean, I don't know, it's kind of a complicated question, I guess, because I think, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3122.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know how you would look at it, but my sense of it is that it's a full maturation of [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3129.96s)]
*  this industry. It's kind of coming to its own in a way that it hadn't really been before. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3134.52s)]
*  That it's now taking a kind of a leading role in shaping policies at the highest levels of [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3142.7599999999998s)]
*  American power. These companies are not ashamed to be public about their intentions. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3149.08s)]
*  And that they have so much. So it's a maturation, I think, because they're so intertwined with, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3156.6s)]
*  specifically the Trump administration, they really think that they have the money and they can [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3166.7599999999998s)]
*  influence the government to do things how they want them to be done, to install policies that [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3172.04s)]
*  they want. So they're not like secondary actors anymore, they're primary actors. And you can see [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3178.44s)]
*  it with the crypto stuff now, where Trump has announced that they're going to be a strategic [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3182.92s)]
*  reserve of Bitcoin and all these other cryptocurrencies. I mean, these are the [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3187.88s)]
*  express demands of the people who, in large part, funded his campaign. And so they are in power now. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3191.32s)]
*  And so they are kind of bringing their ideology in a much more direct way to Washington. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3196.28s)]
*  Just in the last two minutes, what is it they want? What do they want to create that they don't have? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3204.04s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. I mean, I think they have everything they want. I mean, I think they [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3208.52s)]
*  want, I'll tell you what they want. They want the crypto guys just want crypto to be fully [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3211.8s)]
*  basically deregulated and to be mainstreamed and to be made an official part of the American state, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3223.4s)]
*  almost like a secondary currency or something. And they also want access to government contracts. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3232.44s)]
*  They want to be fully embraced by the American state. I mean, they already have been, but they [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3242.36s)]
*  are much more open about it. I mean, I think they want power and they want a seat at the table. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3247.8s)]
*  And they don't want to be regulated. I mean, I think there are different factions. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3251.6400000000003s)]
*  If we're talking about Elon Musk, I think he wants government contracts. He doesn't want to [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3258.2000000000003s)]
*  be investigated for potential Wall Street fraud and all these things. But they just want a seat [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3266.36s)]
*  at the table like every other major industry like Wall Street or things like that. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3271.7200000000003s)]
*  But Elon Musk is talking about the everything app. I mean, they want to cut out banks. They want [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3275.32s)]
*  they want direct, I don't want to use the word relationships, but they want [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3281.96s)]
*  to directly control everything that you do. Yeah, they want to be the main monopolists. They want [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3289.08s)]
*  to be the middleman that funnel your life, the middleman for your entire life. And they are [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3294.7599999999998s)]
*  already that. I mean, this is what I mean is that they already have pretty much everything they want. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3302.6s)]
*  I mean, they're integrated. I mean, if you take Elon Musk, he's a military contractor. He runs [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3307.24s)]
*  one of the most important propaganda or one of the most media platforms, controls it and can [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3313.7999999999997s)]
*  silence whoever he wants or boost whoever he wants on his media platform. He's part of the [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3320.68s)]
*  surveillance state in a massive way. I mean, he's fully integrated with both the kind of the [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3327.16s)]
*  media ecosystem of the American state, but also the security state apparatus. I mean, he is like [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3332.2799999999997s)]
*  has runs a privatized NASA. He puts up spy satellites in the air. He provides spy satellite [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3340.2799999999997s)]
*  technology to the entire military establishment. So he's already fully integrated. I guess they [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3345.4s)]
*  just want more power. And I think they want control. I mean, like to take a really like to [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3351.16s)]
*  have a seat at the table in a way that I think, you know, Wall Street used to have, right, to be [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3355.0s)]
*  the drivers of policy rather than people who kind of lobby at the edges of things, you know, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3360.76s)]
*  That's what Yannis Fairflock is called techno fascism. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3366.84s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. They want to be the guys in charge and they, but they already are in charge. I mean, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3371.32s)]
*  that's kind of thing to me. I mean, there's just hubris, I guess, in a way because they are in [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3375.16s)]
*  charge, but they just want more and you can just see it. I mean, I think Elon Musk [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3381.0s)]
*  is such a distillation of their kind of insanity. It's like you have everything you possibly want, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3384.76s)]
*  but you actually just want more. You want more attention. You want more money. You want more [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3391.32s)]
*  control and you want to be like, I don't know. Yeah. You want to be the king of America and he [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3394.92s)]
*  can't be directly, I guess, because he can't be elected, but he's got the second best position [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3403.2400000000002s)]
*  now. So it is, we live in their world. I mean, this is to close. I think it is important to think [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3409.16s)]
*  about the origins of internet technology because if you do look at the dreams that some people had [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3417.3999999999996s)]
*  that were involved with this stuff, we do live in their world now because the world that they [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3423.64s)]
*  envisioned was a world of technocrats managing the planet and overseeing a world where [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3429.08s)]
*  people's desires are transparent, political movements are transparent, people's obviously [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3442.04s)]
*  buying habits are transparent. Basically, that the soul of human society writ large is sort of [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3447.88s)]
*  turned inside out and can be looked at. And we exist in that. It's extinguishing freedom. I mean, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3457.32s)]
*  let's be clear. That's the end of freedom. That was Yasha Levine on his book, Surveillance Valley, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3464.28s)]
*  The Secret Military History of the Internet. I want to thank Thomas, Diego Max, and Sophia, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1US6sxgKrc&t=3472.6800000000003s)]
