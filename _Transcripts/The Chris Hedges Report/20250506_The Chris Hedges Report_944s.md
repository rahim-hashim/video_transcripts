# Chris Hedges: Trumpland
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE)
*  Trumpland. The corporate coup d'etat and collapse of American democracy began long before Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's simply snuffing out what remains. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=8.0s)]
*  Written by Chris Hedges for the Chris Hedges Report, chrishedges.substack.com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=11.0s)]
*  Narrated by Eunice Wang. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=17.0s)]
*  The Christian fascists and oligarchs gleefully handing Donald Trump his sharpie and executive orders [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=20.0s)]
*  are not making war on the deep state, the radical left, or to protect us from anti-Semites. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=27.0s)]
*  They're making war on verifiable fact, the rule of law and the transparency and accountability [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=33.0s)]
*  that is only possible with a free press, the right to dissent, a vibrant culture and a separation of powers, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=40.0s)]
*  including an independent judiciary. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=46.0s)]
*  All of these pillars of an open society, as I detail in my book, Death of the Liberal Class, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=49.0s)]
*  were degraded long before Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=55.0s)]
*  The press, including public broadcasting, academia, the Democratic Party, a corporatized and banal culture, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=57.0s)]
*  a judiciary that serves a billionaire class, and a congress bought by lobbyists, have been disemboweled. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=64.0s)]
*  They're easily picked off. Few want to rise up to defend them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=71.0s)]
*  They sold us out. Let them die. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=75.0s)]
*  The loss of the liberal class creates a power vacuum filled by speculators, war profiteers, gangsters, and killers, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=79.0s)]
*  often led by charismatic demagogues, I wrote in Death of the Liberal Class in 2010. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=88.0s)]
*  It opens the door to totalitarian movements that rise to prominence by ridiculing and taunting the liberal class [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=94.0s)]
*  and the values it claims to champion. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=102.0s)]
*  The promises of these totalitarian movements are fantastic and unrealistic, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=104.0s)]
*  but their critiques of the liberal class are grounded in truth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=109.0s)]
*  Fascism is birthed by a bankrock liberalism that has surrendered its traditional role in a capitalist democracy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=114.0s)]
*  It no longer ameliorates the worst excesses of the ruling class and the empire by instituting incremental and piecemeal reforms. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=122.0s)]
*  It scolds and moralizes the disenfranchised workers it betrayed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=131.0s)]
*  Media outlets prioritize access to the powerful more than truth. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=136.0s)]
*  They amplified lies and propaganda to propel us into a war on Iraq. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=141.0s)]
*  They lionized Wall Street and assured us it was prudent to entrust our life savings to a financial system run by speculators and thieves. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=146.0s)]
*  Life savings were gutted. They fed us the lies of Russiagate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=156.0s)]
*  They slavishly catered to the Israel lobby, distorting coverage of the genocide and university protests to demonize Palestinians, Muslims, and student protesters. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=160.0s)]
*  They danced to the tune of their corporate advertisers and sponsors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=171.0s)]
*  They render whole sections of the population, whose misery, poverty, and grievances should be the principal focus of journalism, invisible. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=175.0s)]
*  Universities have transformed into corporations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=185.0s)]
*  Senior administrators, who often have a Master of Business Administration, MBA degree, with little or no experience in higher education, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=188.0s)]
*  along with sports coaches, who have the potential to earn the university money, are highly compensated with salaries in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=197.0s)]
*  with prized coaches and college presidents earning in the millions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=206.0s)]
*  A little more than 10% of faculty positions are now tenure-track. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=211.0s)]
*  Nearly 45% are contingent part-time employees or adjuncts. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=216.0s)]
*  One in five are full-time, non-tenure-track positions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=222.0s)]
*  Universities, by radically reducing tenure-track and adequately paid positions, have become extensions of the gig economy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=226.0s)]
*  Adjunct professors and graduate workers are often forced to apply for Medicaid, take second jobs teaching at other colleges, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=235.0s)]
*  driving for Uber or Lyft, working as cashiers, delivering food for Grubhub or DoorDash, walking dogs, house-sitting, waiting on tables, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=242.0s)]
*  bartending, and living four or six to an apartment or camping out on a friend's sofa. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=251.0s)]
*  A poorly paid faculty that lacks job security doesn't raise issues that challenge the dominant narrative, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=259.0s)]
*  whether about social inequality, predatory corporations, the crimes of empire, Israeli genocide, or our state of permanent war. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=265.0s)]
*  If they do, they're dismissed. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=275.0s)]
*  Senior university administrators, meanwhile, are awarded bonuses for reducing expenses by raising tuition and fees, cutting staff, and suppressing wages. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=278.0s)]
*  This instability assures wealthy donors that the neoliberal ideology that is ravaging the country, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=289.0s)]
*  along with enabling the genocide in Gaza, will not be questioned by academics fearful of losing their positions. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=296.0s)]
*  The rich and the powerful are lauded. The working poor, including those employed by the university, are forgotten. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=303.0s)]
*  As Irving Howe pointed out in his 1954 essay, This Age of Conformity, the idea of the intellectual vocation, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=312.0s)]
*  the idea of a life dedicated to values that cannot possibly be realized by a commercial civilization, has gradually lost its allure. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=321.0s)]
*  And it is this, rather than the abandonment of a particular program, which constitutes our route. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=331.0s)]
*  The belief that capitalism is the unassailable engine of human progress, Howe writes, is trumpeted through every medium of communication, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=338.0s)]
*  official propaganda, institutional advertising, and scholarly writings of people who, until a few years ago, were its major opponents. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=348.0s)]
*  The truly powerless people are those intellectuals, the new realists, who attach themselves to the seats of power, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=358.0s)]
*  where they surrender their freedom of expression without gaining any significance as political figures, Howe noted. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=367.0s)]
*  For it is crucial to the history of the American intellectuals in the past few decades, as well as to the relationship between wealth and intellect, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=374.0s)]
*  that whenever they become absorbed into the accredited institutions of society, they not only lose their traditional rebelliousness, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=384.0s)]
*  but to one extent or another, they cease to function as intellectuals. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=393.0s)]
*  The two ruling parties sold the con of neoliberalism to deindustrialize the country, impose punishing austerity, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=399.0s)]
*  eradicate the freedoms to organize, and gut regulations to protect the public from exploitation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=408.0s)]
*  They empowered corporations to pillage and consolidate their wealth and power, giving rise to monopoly capitalism, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=414.0s)]
*  and some of the greatest levels of income inequality and wealth inequality in American history. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=422.0s)]
*  The banks, communications, oil, weapons, agricultural and food industries guarantee profits by fixing prices, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=428.0s)]
*  skirting or even abolishing financial, health, and environmental protections, and abusing their workers. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=438.0s)]
*  This assault on New Deal regulations, soon to be entirely obliterated under Trump, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=445.0s)]
*  disenfranchised the working class that, in desperation, voted in a demagogue to save them. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=451.0s)]
*  As funding for the arts dried up, artists, like public broadcasting, which was designed to give a voice to those not tethered to corporate interests, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=459.0s)]
*  were left searching for grants and corporate sponsors. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=467.0s)]
*  The result was a withering away of artistic and journalistic integrity. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=471.0s)]
*  Friedrich Nietzsche in Beyond Good and Evil holds that only a few people have the fortitude to look into what he calls the molten pit of human reality. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=477.0s)]
*  Most studiously ignore the pit. Artists and philosophers, for Nietzsche, are consumed, however, by an insatiable curiosity, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=489.0s)]
*  a quest for truth and desire for meaning. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=498.0s)]
*  They venture down into the bowels of the molten pit. They get as close as they can before the flames and heat drive them back. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=501.0s)]
*  This intellectual and moral honesty, Nietzsche wrote, comes with a cost. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=510.0s)]
*  Those singed by the fire of reality become burnt children, he wrote, eternal orphans. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=515.0s)]
*  Culture in a functioning democracy is radical and transformative. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=523.0s)]
*  It expresses what lies deep within us. It gives words to our reality. It makes us feel as well as see. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=529.0s)]
*  It allows us to empathize with those who are different or oppressed. It reveals what is happening around us. It honors mystery. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=536.0s)]
*  The precise role of the artist, then, is to illuminate that darkness, blaze roads through the vast forest, James Baldwin wrote, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=545.0s)]
*  so that we will not, in all our doing, lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=554.0s)]
*  The war on independent intellectual inquiry, art and culture, is done to prevent us from looking into the pit, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=563.0s)]
*  from making the world a more human dwelling place. The burnt people have been silenced or marginalized. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=570.0s)]
*  Some 16,000 books were banned in schools and libraries before Trump took office, bans that are accelerating as more books are purged. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=578.0s)]
*  Culture in authoritarian states celebrates an idealized past that never existed and a present that is self-delusional. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=587.0s)]
*  Mass culture feeds the human thirst for illusion, excitement, happiness and hope. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=597.0s)]
*  It peddles a blind patriotism and the myth of eternal material progress. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=603.0s)]
*  It urges us to build images of celebrities or ourselves to worship, especially on social media. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=608.0s)]
*  The result has been a cultural decay whose apotheosis will be Trump's Garden of Heroes [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=615.0s)]
*  and the lavish Christmas pageant being planned this winter at the Kennedy Center in Washington. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=621.0s)]
*  Politicians from the two ruling parties are funded by the dark money provided by billionaires and corporations. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=626.0s)]
*  These politicians, in our system of legalized bribery, do the bidding of their owners in Congress. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=633.0s)]
*  The political philosopher Sheldon Wolin called this form of government inverted totalitarianism. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=640.0s)]
*  Inverted totalitarianism retains the institutions, symbols, iconography and language of the old capitalist democracy, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=646.0s)]
*  but internally corporations have seized all the levers of power to accrue ever greater profits and political control. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=655.0s)]
*  It uses the international legal system to plunder resources in the developing world, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=663.0s)]
*  including the overthrow of governments that challenge corporate dominance. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=669.0s)]
*  It prioritizes profit over justice. It weakens labor laws and eviscerates workers' protections and rights. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=673.0s)]
*  The dynamiting by the Trump administration of these decayed and corrupt institutions [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=682.0s)]
*  will mark the end of the American experiment and the shift from inverted totalitarianism to dictatorship. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=687.0s)]
*  It will usher in a corporate dystopia, which will resemble, albeit in a much crueler form, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=695.0s)]
*  China's totalitarian capitalism, with its pervasive state surveillance, draconian censorship, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=701.0s)]
*  unelected and unaccountable ruling class, and the crushing of popular movements, including labor unions. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=708.0s)]
*  We will descend into the world of magical thinking, that is the hallmark of all despotisms, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=715.0s)]
*  one where the language we use to describe ourselves and our society bears no relationship to reality. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=721.0s)]
*  It is imperative to the authoritarian project that all independent institutions, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=728.0s)]
*  no matter how weakened or decayed, be neutered. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=733.0s)]
*  Trump, Axios reports, has been lashing out at fake polls, showing his sinking approval ratings, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=737.0s)]
*  and calling for the news outlets that publish them to be investigated for election fraud. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=745.0s)]
*  This is the sentiment of all dictators. Ban inconvenient facts. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=751.0s)]
*  Once these institutions are silenced or captured, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=756.0s)]
*  the cracks in the old edifice that allowed a muted dissent will be sealed. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=759.0s)]
*  Fear will be the glue of social cohesion. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=764.0s)]
*  Tepid criticism will be criminalized. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=768.0s)]
*  Internal security, immigration enforcement, and the military will be lavishly funded, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=771.0s)]
*  creating Trump's own version of an unaccountable deep state, while social programs will be defunded or shuttered. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=776.0s)]
*  Central to this project will be the great leader cult, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=784.0s)]
*  the abject servility towards the great leader was on display at Trump's celebration of his first 100 days with his cabinet, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=788.0s)]
*  all of whom had navy blue and red baseball caps in front of them, bearing the message, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=796.0s)]
*  Gulf of America. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=801.0s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a typical display of sycophancy at the meeting, gushed, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=803.0s)]
*  Mr. President, your first 100 days has far exceeded that of any other presidency in this country. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=809.0s)]
*  Ever. Ever. I've never seen anything like it. Thank you. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=816.0s)]
*  Trump will get his birthday military parade, his two 100-foot-high flagpoles on the White House lawns, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=821.0s)]
*  and perhaps, if the proposed bills in Congress pass, his face carved on Mount Rushmore, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=829.0s)]
*  alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=835.0s)]
*  He will see his birthday become a federal holiday, his face on new $250 bills, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=841.0s)]
*  and Washington's Dulles International Airport renamed Donald J. Trump International Airport. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=847.0s)]
*  He will build his National Garden of American Heroes. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=854.0s)]
*  And of course, he will get the overturning of the 22nd Amendment to allow him to serve a third term. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=857.0s)]

*  Children will be taught to love America, the Sven Gali-like Stephen Miller intoned. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=867.0s)]
*  Children will be taught to be patriots. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=873.0s)]
*  Children will be taught civic values for schools that want federal taxpayer funding. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=875.0s)]

*  we're going to make sure these funds are not being used to promote communist ideology. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os0XuV5F9qE&t=885.0s)]
