The Israel lobby wields some of the most influence over American politics than any lobbying group in Washington. As Ilan Pappé, the Israeli historian, professor and author, and host Chris Hedges detail in this latest episode of The Chris Hedges Report, the lobby’s rise to power consisted of diverging ideological factions uniting in pursuit of their shared interests in controlling the land of historic Palestine. The history and manifestation of this systemic corruption of the Zionist lobby, hyper-dependent on coercion and total control, is thoroughly described in Pappé’s new book, Lobbying for Zionism on Both Sides of the Atlantic.

# Ilan Pappé The Rise and Coming Fall of the Israel Lobby  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m6S1iXlsqw)
*  The Israel's lobby buying off of nearly every senior politician in the United States facilitated
*  by our system of legalized bribery is not an anti-Semitic trope, it is a fact.
*  The lobby's campaign of vicious character assassination, smearing and blacklisting against
*  those who defend Palestinian rights, including the Israeli historian Elon Pappi and university
*  students, many of them Jewish, in organizations such as Students for Justice in Palestine
*  is not an anti-Semitic trope, it is a fact.
*  The passage of Israeli-backed legislation requiring workers and contractors under the
*  threat of dismissal to sign a pro-Israel oath and promise not to support the boycott, divestment
*  and sanctions movement is not an anti-Semitic trope, it is a fact.
*  The shameless cheerleading by most members of Congress of the Israeli Prime Minister
*  Benjamin Netanyahu when he addressed Congress in the midst of the Gaza genocide is not an
*  anti-Semitic trope, it is a fact.
*  The US refusal, including in the United Nations and other international bodies, to criticize
*  Israel's apartheid state and routine violation of international law is not an anti-Semitic
*  trope, it is a fact.
*  The well-funded campaigns by the Israel lobby, which works closely with Israel's Ministry
*  of Strategic Affairs, to discredit any American politician or academic who even slightly deviates
*  from Israeli policy, is not an anti-Semitic trope, it is a fact.
*  The massive interference in our internal affairs by Israel and the lobby, far exceeding that
*  of any other country, including Russia or China, is not an anti-Semitic trope, it is
*  a fact.
*  Israel's lackeys in the political class, along with bankrupt courtiers in the US press, are
*  making a serious mistake, however, in refusing to acknowledge the outsized, transparent and
*  often illegal meddling by Israel in the American political system and Israel's brutal oppression
*  of the Palestinians.
*  It is too obvious and too egregious to hide.
*  The longer the ruling elites ignore this reality and censor and target those such as Representative
*  Ilhan Omar or Jamal Bowman, who lost his congressional seat after seeing the Israel lobby pour money
*  into the race to defeat him, the more it gives credence to the racist, bigots, conspiracy
*  theorists and white hate groups, many rooted in the Christian right, who are the real anti-Semites.
*  Israel and its lobby, rather than protecting Israel and Jews, are steadily nullifying their
*  moral and ultimately political force.
*  Criticism of Israel and the ideology of Zionism is not anti-Semitic.
*  Criticism of Israel's influence and control over US foreign policy and of Israeli efforts
*  to silence those who champion Palestinian rights is not anti-Semitic.
*  Criticism of the genocide in Gaza and the occupation of Palestine is not anti-Semitic.
*  The more Israel and the Israel lobby abuse the charge of anti-Semitism, a charge the
*  Israel lobby leveled against Jeremy Corbyn to defeat his bid to be Prime Minister and
*  Labour Party leader in the UK, the more they lose their effectiveness against the dangerous
*  anti-Semites.
*  But Israel and its lobby do not care if its political allies, including those in the Christian
*  right and the Trump White House, possess warped and racist attitudes about Jews.
*  The sole criterion of Israel and the Israel lobby in determining who to support and who
*  to demonize is identifying who backs the far-right agenda of the apartheid state of Israel and
*  who does not.
*  Genuine anti-Semitism is irrelevant.
*  For Israel, the world is divided along the fault lines of Palestinian rights.
*  Stand up for the Palestinians and you are an anti-Semite.
*  Cheer their marginalization, oppression and murder and you are a friend of Jews.
*  Have Jewish leaders forgotten their own history?
*  Anti-Semitism is wrong and dangerous, not only because it is bad for the Jews, but because
*  the dark forces of ethnic and religious hatred used by Israel and the lobby against its critics
*  are bad for everyone, including the Jews and the Palestinians.
*  Israel has opened this Pandora's box of evils at its own peril.
*  Joining me to discuss the history and reach of the Israel lobby in the US and the UK is
*  the Israeli historian Ilan Pape, Professor of History at the Institute of Arab and Islamic
*  Studies and Director of the European Center for Palestine Studies at the University of
*  Exeter in the UK, who has long been a target for Zionists.
*  His new book, Lobbying for Zionism on Both Sides of the Atlantic, explores how a century
*  of aggressive Zionist lobbying has impacted and deformed the Middle East as well as the
*  political landscape in the US and Britain.
*  So Ilan, in the beginning of your book, you write in the history of lobbying for Zionism,
*  you call it a history of prophets, very committed individuals like the Earl of Shaftesbury who
*  believed they were guided directly by God and who promulgated an idea that metamorphized
*  into a political crusade.
*  We've kind of come full circle, of course, with the settler movement.
*  You say before anything else, Zionism was a narrative.
*  Can you unpack that for us?
*  Yes, definitely.
*  I think in the history of all ideologies that do transform realities, in the end of the
*  day, you don't start with an institution.
*  Sometimes you start with ideas that are being conceived by individuals, but if they are
*  powerful enough and are networking properly with alliances, ideas which might seem very
*  abstract and theoretical are translated into reality on the ground.
*  Now these particular people I'm talking about in the early history, if you want, of lobbying
*  for Zionism were probably made of two kinds of kind of personalities.
*  You had the more religious ones who were very closely connected to evangelical Christianity,
*  to old evangelical Christianity, but one particular kind of stream within Christianity, you could
*  call it the restorationists, people who were very busy writing and thinking about the connection
*  between what they would call the return of the Jews to the Holy Land and the end of time.
*  The return of the Messiah, the resurrection of the dead and so on.
*  So this was one group of people who were devoting much of their life, their public life, sometimes
*  even their private life, to push forward something that they believed was a religious assignment.
*  Next to them were people who were a bit more cynical about it, and these were people, you
*  could call them imperialists, who saw the theological ideas as a good pretext for fulfilling
*  more secular political roles.
*  In the case of Palestine, these were people who were not very comfortable or did not support
*  policy throughout the 19th century to keep the Ottoman Empire intact, because people
*  in Britain were worried that once the empire collapses, there will be a total war in Europe
*  over the spoils of the empire, especially the provinces in Europe.
*  And they thought that it was good actually to hasten the fall of the empire, and they
*  wanted not only Palestine, but also Syria and Egypt, to expand the British Empire over
*  those areas in order to strengthen both the land and other kind of connections between
*  Britain and its South Asian colonies or interests.
*  So you have these people that probably at the time did not look very important, because
*  they did not have institutions behind them or organizations, but when we read them in
*  retrospect, we see how their ideas, once they had institutions behind them, become strategies,
*  programs, and then affect the life of people in a very significant way.
*  There were two aspects of this in the early years of Zionism that I found fascinating.
*  One is that it was a top-down movement, had very little popular support.
*  A lot of this, especially by the wealthy European Zionists, it was about moving people under
*  Russian occupation or in Eastern Europe from the shtetls, but not going themselves.
*  And the second was an absolute misreading of the power of, let's call it what they called
*  world Jewry.
*  Can you talk about those two aspects?
*  Yes, definitely.
*  There was, again here, I think a mixture of a genuine concern and a more cynical one.
*  I think some of the people, such as the one who is regarded as the founding father or
*  the main prophet of the Zionist movement on the Jewish side, Theodor Herzl, who I think
*  were genuinely moved by the plight of Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under the Russian
*  Empire, that as it became more and more nationalistic, that kind of Russian nationalism was also
*  more anti-Semitic than the previous kind of more czarist overall ideas of what Russia
*  was.
*  So I think there was a genuine wish to help the Russian Jews, but at the same time there
*  was a great worry that the kind of anti-Semitic policies of Russia, the more nationalist Russia,
*  would push these Jews into the West, into Germany, Britain, and even to the United States.
*  And by the time that these, I call them the Anglo-Jewish aristocrats and the non-Jewish
*  Anglo-Aristocrats, were kind of looking at the idea, this mixture of a genuine concern
*  for people who are under persecution on the one hand and a more cynical worry from waves
*  of immigration, when they were sort of thinking about these issues, already the first groups
*  of Jews have already arrived in London, especially from Romania and Russia.
*  And yes, we have to all remember that we are talking about Russia with the beginning of
*  also Bolshevik ideas and socialist ideas, so we didn't only see them as an economic
*  burden because most of them were very poor, but also people who were motivated by revolutionaries'
*  ideas that could undermine the political stability in Britain and later in the United States.
*  So you had this kind of a mixture of concern and cynical ideas, and I think that some of
*  the people who were involved in this, these aristocrats, especially I think second sons
*  and third sons who had more time to deal with this issue, even in a scholarly way if
*  you want to, fell in love with the idea that maybe the Jews were a nation to themselves,
*  which was both an anti-Semitic idea and a philisemitic idea, namely if the Jews are
*  a nation to themselves, they're not British, but if they are a nation to themselves, they
*  can still serve a very important role in history, especially if you are a religious, pious Christian.
*  Or Jew for that matter.
*  So you had this kind of mixture of imperialist impulses, anti-Semitic, philisemitic, I would
*  call it even Islamophobic when it came eventually to decide who would rule Palestine.
*  It was genuine care for people who were suffering from racist persecution, and it served different
*  purposes for different people.
*  But the most important thing is of course, and that's what you mentioned, and I think
*  that's very important, and I'm not sure how many people understand that, that the one
*  of the major, I'm not saying the only one, but as I say in the book, one of the major
*  motives for leaders of the Jewish community in Britain to support the idea of the Jews
*  going from Russia to Palestine was the fear that these Jews would come to London.
*  This is important because this is where they would connect with someone like Arthur Balfour,
*  who in 1905, 1906 were passing legislation in parliament to make sure that Jews would
*  not be able to enter Britain.
*  This went together between anti-Semite non-Jews and Jews who were, I would call them anti-Semite
*  to a certain extent, against Jews who were not like them for centuries part of the British
*  society.
*  So Palestine became this receptor for these people for good reasons and for more cynical
*  reasons.
*  This was supposed to be the place where the problem of Jews, if you really cared about
*  it, in Russia would be solved, where the problem of Jews that might come and undermine your
*  social and economic and political stability would be solved, and where Jews might even
*  contribute to the end of time if you were a restorationist evangelical Christian.
*  And there was a political divide because socialism was an ideology that much of the working class
*  embraced on the eve of World War I, both in Britain and the United States, but the hierarchy
*  or the leaders of the Zionist movement were very wary of socialism.
*  And I just want to throw in, because it's a fascinating point that you make in the book,
*  is that eventually the socialist, European socialist movements embrace the Zionist project
*  and the only people that call it out for the settler colonial project that it is are the
*  Marxist-Leninist.
*  Yes, it's quite incredible, isn't it?
*  It's like you worry that socialism would be brought by these Jewish immigrants into the
*  heart of Britain, but if these socialists want to try and play, if you want, with socialism
*  in Palestine, that's fine.
*  That's actually less dangerous.
*  And I think that's why you had these kind of aristocrats or the political elite of
*  Jews who really made it in Britain to the highest positions in government or in businesses,
*  who definitely if you would talk to them in principle about socialism, they would be very
*  much against it.
*  But if you would tell them that the Zionist settlers in Palestine are trying to create
*  socialist havens like a kibbutz or something similar to that before the kibbutz came into
*  being, they would have nothing against it.
*  And this is the whole game of Zionism.
*  It is a solution for a certain group of Jews that is developed by a certain group of Jews
*  who are not part of that project, but that project serves other interests that they have.
*  And of course, as I all the time mention every ten pages so that I don't forget it and that
*  the readers don't forget it, all this is about a country where already someone else lived
*  in it.
*  We should never forget it, that this whole game, whether it was an abstract intellectual
*  imagination or emotional imagination, when it becomes real political programs, all the
*  time in the background we should remember this is about a place where already someone
*  else lives as an organic society.
*  That seems to be a totally irrelevant fact to those who try to think of Palestine as
*  a solution from a theological point of view, imperialist point of view, or even a genuine
*  humanist point of view looking for a solution for people who suffer from anti-Semitic persecution.
*  And when it does come up, the Zionist argument and the argument of those who support Zionism
*  is that the indigenous population will be better off because of the Sadler Colonial
*  Project.
*  Yeah, absolutely. And I think that the other tactic is to kind of downplay the indigeneity
*  of the population by sort of referring to its nomadic nature, by its less of development,
*  so they can't really have the same aspiration for self-determination and nationalism as
*  the Jews. It's kind of a native that is not European and therefore their collective aspirations
*  do not have to play a very important role even if they are recognized. In some cases
*  they are not even recognized. But as I say in the book, some of the family members of
*  the same Jewish aristocrats who supported Zionism, one of the reasons they were against
*  Zionism, the main reason was that they worried that Jews would be blamed for having dual
*  nationality, dual loyalty. But some of them in their writings are also against it because
*  they are aware that this is not the land without people working for people without land and
*  they warned that actually Jews would be part of a project very early on, so to my great
*  surprise when I found it, that this would be at the expense of the people who live there.
*  And this was in the very beginning when they heard about Zionism and understood what this
*  ideology means for the people in Palestine itself.
*  Talk about the shift of power. So eventually you have figures like David Ben-Gurion who
*  lives in Palestine and is organizing, he himself is a socialist, the Seller Colonial Project
*  and power shifts away from these European aristocrats, these European Zionists into
*  the hands of figures like Ben-Gurion. That's a very important moment in the history of
*  the Zionist movement. Explain what happened.
*  Yeah, that is very important because I think there was, and I described what I thought
*  was a very important moment, a very important meeting in London in the headquarters of the
*  Zionist movement when they're actually all these members of the Anglo-Jewish elite are
*  being actually told by emissaries on behalf of David Ben-Gurion that they are not leaving
*  the Zionist movement. They will not determine what Zionism is or what the Jewish state would
*  be and their role is really to be a lobby, a propaganda machine for Zionism.
*  There was a very important moment because what Ben-Gurion understood, as I suppose some
*  of the leaders of the white settlers in America understood, that while you need the British
*  Empire to set a foothold in Palestine, there will be a moment when the interests of the
*  Empire and your own interests will clash. He didn't want these Anglo-Zionists who might
*  still be also loyal British citizens to interfere in the Zionist plan not only to colonize Palestine
*  and to de-Arabize it, but also to cede it from the British Empire and make it an independent
*  Jewish state. So this is the moment where they have to decide whether they're willing
*  to be advocates for a policy that is formulated by Jews that just 20, 30 years before that,
*  they had a very lofty attitude towards them as Eastern European Jews, uneducated and just
*  poor people who need a safe place to be in. But they're becoming their own, they're actually
*  becoming employed by these Jews who are now running the show in Palestine. Some of these
*  Anglo-Jewish members of the elite would distance themselves from Zionism because of that. They
*  would not become anti-Zionists, but they didn't want to serve as the part of this what I call
*  the pro-Zionist lobby in Britain.
*  I mean we'll talk about this later, but at the end of the book you really talk about
*  the Zionist lobby perpetuating itself at this point at the expense of Israel is the argument
*  that you make. But let's go back to what's happened in Palestine on the eve of World
*  War II. You write the catastrophe that befell the Palestinians in 1948, this is the Nakba
*  when 750,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed and the Jewish state was founded.
*  It's not because Britain decided sometime between 1950 and 1917 to take over Palestine,
*  but because it was persuaded to make Palestine Zionist. I think that's a very important point
*  because a superficial reading of history is often that because of the mandate Britain
*  controlled Palestine, seizing it in World War from the Ottoman Empire in World War I
*  up until 1948, but you argue that it was always about the Zionist project.
*  Absolutely. You have to remember that from a British strategic point of view before the
*  First World War, the parts of the Ottoman Empire which were important were parts that
*  had strategic value for the Empire like Iraq and Egypt because they were the connection
*  between the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula, or later on when oil is discovered
*  in the Arabian Peninsula or in Persia, in Iran that is, then these become very important
*  places. If you would have asked anyone who was kind of involved in strategizing for the
*  Empire, they would tell you that Palestine has very little strategic value. So yes, if
*  it was a Zionist state, it was not a state of its religiosity, but strategically speaking,
*  it was not that important for Britain. So I think that there was always a danger from
*  a Zionist perspective that unless you convince Britain that a Zionist state is good for the
*  British Imperial, set up that Britain would be willing, for instance, as it was at times,
*  making it a more international place because it is so holy to all three religions. But
*  I think that's the greatest success of the Zionist lobby of finding enough important
*  people among the policy makers in Britain to convince them that the British interest
*  was, would be best served not just by having Palestine, but making Palestine a Jewish state.
*  And I claim in the book that every now and then more reasonable, I would say, kind of
*  British policy makers were not totally convinced. And that's why the lobby was very intensively
*  working on it and needed very strong believers in Zionism. And it's very interesting to compare,
*  for instance, how they worked with David Lloyd, who was a liberal and Christian, and
*  how they worked with the emerging Labour Party. So to one side, they saw the idea of the kind
*  of end of time, the fulfillment of the end of time prophecy. If you, David Lloyd, would
*  support the idea of a Jewish state, and this would return the days of the Crusaders, bringing
*  back the Holy Land to Christianity. And to the Labour Party, they saw it as a paragon
*  of socialism. They were very clever, and I have to give it to them. And they really kind
*  of tailored the narrative of what the Jewish state is to the potential allies they needed.
*  First of all, in Britain, because Britain was most important until 1948 for the fate
*  in Palestine. And then afterwards, when they understood that the power shifted to America,
*  they did the same in the United States.
*  You're talking about David Lloyd George, the former Prime Minister, who ended up embracing
*  the Zionist project. And as you note in the book, he was also employed by the Zionists,
*  his law firm. So he had a financial interest in the perpetuation of Zionism. And it's also
*  interesting that although he was a socialist, his vision or view of Palestine and the Middle
*  East was really colored by the very Christian household in which he had grown up. And he
*  would use these kind of biblical terms to refer to what was happening in Palestine.
*  You know, the Balfour Declaration, it's well known. This is the commitment, very short,
*  the commitment on the part of the British government in the middle of World War II to
*  build a Zionist state and appeal to the kind of conspiracy theories that worldwide Jewry
*  and America and everyone could bring America into the war and the Germans might co-opt
*  worldwide Jewry. It was complete fantasy. But it should be noted because it colored
*  British policy. Let's talk about what was happening on the ground in Palestine.
*  On the first anniversary, this is from your book, of the Balfour Declaration, Palestinians
*  demonstrated in large numbers all over Palestine against it. From that moment onwards, a consolidated
*  Palestinian national movement led by a younger generation of urban professionals and intellectuals
*  alongside traditional heads of rural and urban clans commenced an anti-colonialist struggle
*  for nine years, 1920-1929. The activity consisted of petitions, participation in negotiations
*  with the British government while building a democratic political structure where parties
*  could elect the representatives to an annual national conference. The consensual position
*  was clear, total rejection of the Balfour Declaration and opposition to Jewish immigration
*  into Palestine, the Zionist purchase of land and colonization from the moment it began.
*  And I think this point is an important one because much of the argument by Zionists is
*  that the Palestinians had no national identity.
*  That's right. And I think, as I said before, this is one of the arguments that their supporters
*  used to say, you don't have to worry about the aspirations of the local people because
*  they don't have these national aspirations. Now, like anyone else in the area, the national
*  aspirations were not, there was no need to, at first there was no need to articulate them
*  in such an assertive way because if you look at Iraq, Jordan or Lebanon, it was clear that
*  yes, you had colonial or ex-colonial powers now having a mandate from the League of Nations
*  and eventually these countries would become nation states. And you could have expected
*  from a Palestinian point of view that the same thing would happen in Palestine. And
*  therefore, you don't have a very active, intensive need to articulate a Palestinian national
*  identity until the Baffel Declaration comes with the British occupation when the Palestinians
*  realize or their leaders and activists realize that it will not be a case like Iraq, Syria
*  or Lebanon where Iraqis would get Iraq and Lebanese would get Lebanon. No. Palestine
*  was promised to the Jewish national movement Zionism and that kind of turned and already
*  existing, I would say more dormant, more evolutionary Palestinian national movement and turned it
*  into a more revolutionary one. One that understood as the years go by during the mandate that
*  if it remains passive, Palestine would never be their homeland, let alone, they will never
*  be their nation state and maybe even not their homeland. And that's when they become to be
*  actively involved in trying to persuade Britain to retract from the Baffel Declaration and
*  actually be loyal to the principle that supposedly after the First World War the victorious allies
*  promised people who were under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, namely two
*  principles, the principle of self-determination and the principle of democracy, namely that
*  the majority would decide how self-determination would look like. And they said why don't you
*  apply it in Palestine? Let's apply the majoritarian idea in Palestine and the self-determination
*  for the native indigenous people of Palestine. And they were told by the British in your
*  case this is impossible because of the pledge the British Empire made to the Zionist movement.
*  Also because David Lloyd George greedily saw the expansion of empires a plus for Britain,
*  the irony, the socialist prime minister. We did finally have a revolt 1936, 1937. I think
*  the British have to deploy about 100,000 troops to crush it. It essentially made the 1948
*  effort to defy the armed Zionist movement that seized most of historic Palestine. But
*  it was timing. I mean that revolt which was crushed essentially weakened the Palestinians
*  to such an extent that by 1948 there was very little they could do to resist the
*  resistance. And we can talk about that mythic narrative of what is it, six Arab nations
*  attacking. And that's of course hyperbolic rhetoric given the reality of what happened
*  on the ground. But that resistance as you point out in your book was from the inception.
*  Originally it was nonviolent and then of course being cut off right and left and ignored it
*  erupted into violence.
*  Absolutely. I mean the history of anti-colonialist movements in very few cases you have pacifist
*  anti-colonialist movements. So yes, violence eventually is employed by those who rebel
*  against colonization and oppression. But this is a violence which is employed for existential
*  reasons in order to prevent being colonized. In the case of Palestine not just being colonized
*  but being ethnically cleansed from Palestine. So nobody says that they haven't eventually
*  used, didn't use an armed struggle. But what is for me so interesting and again this comes
*  to me as one of the achievements of the lobby that even years later when you narrate anti-colonialist
*  movements in Africa, Latin America and Asia, many years later people say no these were
*  noble movements of liberation whether they were more violent or less violent and they
*  were right to demand that the colonialist empires would leave the colonies and would
*  allow them to be independent. The great success of the lobby was that many years later this
*  natural justified impulse of people to revolt against and attempt to both colonize them
*  and then uproot them for years was still regarded as terrorism for the sake of terrorism. You
*  know something that comes out of a cultural, culture of violence and not out of the reality
*  of oppression and I would say that even today in Britain and the United States I can find
*  a lot of educated people who would still say well what the Palestinians are doing is really
*  terrorism and it goes back to that period because definitely in pro-Israeli narratives
*  in American and British academia the revolt we are talking about 1936 to 1939 and even
*  the Palestinians attempts to prevent the ethnic cleansing of 1948 are still narrated
*  as the early acts of terrorism motivated by anti-Semitism and by culture of violence rather
*  than a classical case of colonized people trying to prevent the colonization of their
*  homeland.
*  When the Zionist militias pre-1948 attempt to drive the British out they employ the tactic
*  of terrorism like all resistance movements like Hamas. The terrorism unfortunately, the
*  ANC, the FLN in Algeria that is in the tool bag unfortunately of anti-colonial resistance
*  forces but of course they put a bomb in a satchel or a suicide vest because they don't
*  have an air force. They don't have the tools of let's call it state or industrial terror.
*  But I do think the Zionist terrorism was much more like the one used by the French settlers
*  in Algeria when the French government decided to end French rule in Algeria. So this is
*  where the settlers feel that the empire according to them should do two things. It should of
*  course leave but it should help them to take over the country which the British didn't
*  do. Country by the way to history books that claim that Britain kind of in 48 helped the
*  Zionists to take over Palestine. No, their sin was being actually neutral and not doing
*  anything which was as bad as doing something. But this is really what is so fascinating
*  about it that again the narrative then becomes of the Jewish terrorists becoming the freedom
*  fighters of the future and the Palestinians still remain in the image in the west of continuing
*  being a terrorist rather than being transformed in the public eye as so many people were transformed
*  eventually like Mandela or the leaders of the FLM or Nakruma, people who were fighting against
*  the, not to mention Gandhi, people who were fighting against the British Empire and later
*  on were recognized as leaders of the independent decolonized world. Somehow and I think this
*  is the success of the lobby was not allowing the Palestinians to fall into that category
*  where you are being seen differently once there is a healthy moral objection to colonialism
*  when the world is being decolonized. I mean the only difference is that of course the
*  French settlers in Algeria were angry because de Gaulle and the French planned to leave whereas
*  the Zionists wanted the British to leave. So throughout this period and this has crippled
*  the Palestinians, you are right they had nothing equivalent to the Zionist lobby and their
*  leadership had no idea what a powerful enemy they were facing. I of course covered Arafat,
*  that was as true for the PLO as it was in the 1920s. Absolutely. It is quite incredible
*  and I think part of this naive belief that the leaders had that after all they were the
*  majority of the land, of the people in the country. They had promises from the international
*  community. The Arab world was around them and would certainly help them. All that led
*  to certain passivity compared to the very effective mechanism of the Zionist lobby.
*  But I think I can in retrospect unravel or unpack how powerful the Zionist lobby was.
*  I don't underestimate how difficult it would have been from Palestine to understand it.
*  70% of the Palestinians were living in rural Palestine in villages, world politics were
*  hardly of any interest to them. The idea that someone in London, in Washington was helping
*  other people, foreign people, to plan their uprooting, their displacement was very far
*  from their agenda. They could not even begin to think about it. It is very interesting
*  to compare the kind of negotiations which the Zionist leaders have with the British
*  Empire and later with the United Nations and the Palestinian leaders have with them. The
*  Palestinians are kind of keep repeating this idea that surely the principle of democracy
*  and self-determination is on their side as if there is no cynical game that could really
*  be more important than the pledges made to them by the international community. Whereas
*  the Zionists all the time assume that what matters is hardly any pledges or any international
*  decisions. Even the petition plan is very clear. Ben-Gurion tells the people in London,
*  forget about the petition plan. What was important is recognition of the Jewish state, but the
*  petition plan itself was not important because Israel's border would be determined by the
*  army and the alliances that it would have in the world and so on. It was a very different
*  take on the code of behavior in the region and in the international community that allowed
*  the Zionist movement to build a very strong alliance and the Palestinians were not able
*  to match it in any way.
*  Before we go on, there is an important point you make. The Christian lobby, the Christian
*  Zionist lobby, which of course is huge today within the Christian right, is a natural kind
*  of ally with the Zionists, perhaps at this point Israel's most important ally in terms
*  of popular support in the United States. You write an important pillar of this coalition
*  was the white settler colonial community in the U.S. I think that's extremely important
*  whose elite segments were now easily convinced of the religious basis of another settler
*  colonial project, this time in Palestine. From the beginning, what's called the Christian
*  Zionists or Christian fundamentalists, their interests and of course they deify our own
*  white settler colonial project, it's been a powerful force in shaping the creation of
*  modern Israel.
*  Absolutely. If you look at the discourse, the language, the images, the early European
*  settlers, some of them used when they arrived in what became the United States and Canada
*  later on, you can see how much the Bible was a source of inspiration by naming the new
*  settlements, places like Zion and on the names of biblical names and so on. Therefore, the
*  identification with a similar act by Jewish settlers came first of all from the idea that
*  you are actually creating two Zionists or two Jerusalems, one on the mountain and one
*  on the land if you want. Therefore, there was this identification of Judeo-Christian
*  kind of assignment to create a new Holy Land, one where the Holy Land was originally and
*  one in a new place. Also, it was very easy to associate the Palestinians with the natives
*  that the European settlers met in North America. That created this kind of ideological, I would
*  say even mental kind of associations between the two projects, the project of creating
*  the United States and the creation of Palestine. Then even if you go to higher resolutions,
*  you begin to see similarities in the way the frontier is discussed. The frontier where
*  you are meeting the savages or the non-civilized people and you fight in order to civilize
*  the next space where it's still, where still the natives are controlling. There's even
*  kind of similar, quite chilling for me in a way, appropriation of the indigenous people's
*  dress code, some of their folklore, food and even a kind of code of behavior and you appropriated
*  yourself in order actually to destroy the native people through such an appropriation
*  Norm Chomsky once commented cynically that at least unlike the Americans, the Israelis
*  have never called their lethal weapons in the names of native American tribes that they
*  have eliminated, like the Apache helicopter. But yes, these similarities in the narrative
*  that justifies the settler colonial project, the attitude towards the natives and the indigenous
*  people, the appropriation of the indigenous history and customs and eventually the most
*  important thing, the right to eliminate them and the justification for that elimination
*  are so similar despite the different ways in which they are being used.
*  So let's go to 1948 and let's focus on the importance of the lobby in the creation of
*  the state of Israel. We should note that at the time of the Balfour Declaration, was it
*  1917? Was that the Balfour, year of the Balfour? I can't remember. So, 1917. So 10% of the
*  population of Israel was born in the Balfour Declaration. So that's the year of the Balfour
*  Declaration. Historic Palestine is Jewish, half of them are settlers. Of course, the
*  genocide carried out by Germany, by the Nazis, and then those who survived that genocide,
*  the Jews who survived often were unable to return home, especially the places like Poland,
*  their houses were occupied, very similar to what happens, of course, after 1948 with the
*  Nakba. They have nowhere else to go and this, you know, to a certain extent, is a very important
*  kind of, in a dark way, thrills Zionists like David Ben-Gurion. And so you have the lobby,
*  in the name of the Holocaust, Norman Finkelstein wrote his book, of course, the Holocaust Industry
*  and the sort of appropriation of Jewish suffering. But that's an extremely important moment and
*  here the lobby is key. So let's talk about the lobby, what it did after 19, or with 1948.
*  Yeah. The lobby became very effective in several ways. First of all, those who operated
*  the lobby, mostly David Ben-Gurion, but all the people who helped him, were already identified,
*  I think back in 1942, that there is a shift of power as far as the Zionist interest is
*  concerned from London to Washington. And gradually they understand that they don't have to work
*  that hard in London anymore, but they have to work hard in Washington. Because that's
*  eventually where the more important decisions about the future of Palestine would be made.
*  And this is when they begin to Zionize, I call it in the book, the Anglo-American Jewish
*  community, which until then is not totally thrilled by Zionism in large numbers and its
*  more established institutions are not necessarily Zionist.
*  Let me just interrupt, Ilan. I mean, before the Holocaust, before World War I, Zionism,
*  especially in the United States, had very little support.
*  Exactly. Exactly. And even the Holocaust itself did not create necessarily among Jews in America
*  support for Zionism. It was, of course, a genuine concern for the Jews in the United
*  States who were genocided in Europe. But the lobby was working very hard and effectively
*  to connect the Holocaust or the fight against the possibility of another Holocaust with
*  American Jewish support for a Jewish state in Palestine.
*  Now the problem for the lobby was on several fronts. One, that not all the American Jewish
*  community was convinced that building a Jewish state in Palestine would either solve anti-Semitism
*  or was the right response to the Holocaust. Secondly, in those days, and I think some
*  of your viewers and listeners would find it difficult to accept, but in those days, American
*  policy towards places such as Palestine was still very much formulated by the State Department
*  rather than by the White House. And the State Department had people that later on, those
*  who liked them and those who disliked them, equally would call them the Arabists, namely
*  people who knew Arabic, who knew the Arab world. And these people identified more with
*  the Palestinians, one should say. And also saw the total American support for a Jewish
*  state in Palestine as undermining American interest in the region as a whole. So you
*  had also a much more neutral and professional, if you want, State Department that created
*  a problem to the Zionist lobby. In fact, to the point that even after the petition plan
*  was adopted, because the petition plan led to violence on the ground in Palestine immediately
*  after it was adopted in the end of November 1947, the State Department advised the president
*  for a while, Harry Truman accepted it, that maybe America should withdraw its support
*  for the petition and support one democratic state in Palestine, which for a few months
*  was the official American position until the lobby succeeded, pressuring Truman in an election
*  year to retract his support for the one state and go back to support the petition. So they
*  had, this is not America of today, this was a United States where politically, ideologically
*  you still had some forces at the policy making level that were still doubtful about the wisdom,
*  even the strategic wisdom, some of them even about the moral wisdom of supporting a Jewish
*  state at the expense of Palestine. And therefore it was very important for the lobby to work
*  hard. Another and final example is the vote in the United Nations that eventually decided
*  to recognize the right of the Jews to have a state in at least half of Palestine and
*  later also legalized the takeover of 80% of Palestine. Although most of the colonized
*  world was still not represented in the United Nations General Assembly, so despite the fact
*  that the United States has a lot of influence on the General Assembly at that time, even
*  then there were some member states who were not entirely convinced about the idea of a
*  Jewish state, especially those who were aware about the reality in Palestine. So the lobby
*  was working day and night to persuade the president to not to follow the advice of the
*  State Department. Secondly, to use American resources to pressure reluctant countries
*  to vote for a Jewish state and to make sure that the United States, despite moments of
*  unpleasantness, and I mentioned them in the book, where the United States thinks that
*  the Israeli policy is unacceptable, especially not allowing the refugees to return, despite
*  these moments, that the U.S. would maybe talk the talk but not walk the walk. They
*  can condemn but not do anything significant to change the course of history. This was
*  a volatile moment for the lobby, and this is before APAC. In fact, I think APAC eventually
*  is established in 1954 as a far more effective lobby, understanding that there were very
*  volatile from a lobby perspective. There were very volatile moments before 1954 when APAC
*  was established, and this is one of the conclusions from that period, that you need a far more
*  aggressive and far more effective lobby so that the bad period of not only Harry Truman
*  but specifically Dwight Eisenhower administration will not repeat itself.
*  And we just throw in 1956, the Israelis, the French and the British attempt to seize the
*  Suez Canal, Nasser, Gamal Abdel Nasser wants to nationalize the canal and its Eisenhower
*  intervenes and stops that. It was kind of the end of the British Empire. We should also
*  note that the Arabists, who you talk about, they were one of the first targets of the
*  Zionist lobby and they were purged from the State Department in the 1950s. Robert Kaplan
*  writes a book about it called The Arabists, and that's how you essentially since then
*  turn Israel-Palestine policy over to figures like Martin Indyk, Tony Blinken and others
*  who are really in essence committed Zionists and their perspective is completely distorted
*  throughout the Middle East by Zionism. Let's talk about 1954, APAC is founded. That really
*  is the creation, certainly in the United States. We can talk a little bit about Britain and
*  I do want to talk about Tony Blair, which I didn't know until I read your book. His
*  political fortunes were essentially underwritten by the Zionist lobby and allowed him, as you
*  point out in the book, to ignore the traditional base of labor, which were unions, which of
*  course Blair betrayed the working class of Britain and the union movement. But let's
*  talk about the lobby, the creation of the lobby and how it works. We just saw Prime
*  Minister Netanyahu address Congress, I think it was the fourth time. Congress was rapturous,
*  I mean this is a guy who's, there's a warrant for his arrest of course, as a war criminal,
*  he has ongoing genocide in Gaza. But Congress was always the key. Maybe the media was very
*  important but clearly within the US system, the Zionist lobby realized they had to own
*  Congress, which they do to this day. And if you oppose even tepidly the Zionist project,
*  Jamal Bowman and others, you are targeted and often pushed out of the political system.
*  So let's talk about the machinery of the lobby from 1954 onwards and how it works.
*  What is so interesting is actually they got the idea from a failed attempt back in 1900,
*  when the Zionist lobby began in Britain, when the first lobbyist in Britain decided to write
*  to every candidate for the national elections in Britain and telling them that they would
*  support them or the rivals if they support the Zionist project in Palestine. Now in the
*  British electoral system it didn't work that well because it's a constituencies kind of
*  parliamentary system. But this kind of method, which was not the only method as you say,
*  but it was definitely the principle method, was adopted by C. Cannon, a lobbyist, the
*  early lobbyist for Zionism who worked a little bit with the Israeli delegation in the United
*  Nations, in the trade unions, a guy from Cleveland originally from Canada, who really developed
*  this idea that you need to connect yourself to early career politicians at the regional
*  level, at the national level, even at the municipal level and follow their career from
*  the very beginning and offer help or threaten to withdraw help or give help to their rivals
*  in order to create a long life commitment to Israel. We're talking already about Israel,
*  not just Zionism. And it's incredible because I think what happened is that it worked. The
*  first fruits probably were already in the midterm elections in 1954, but definitely
*  through the campaigns that Nixon was trying to, I'm sorry, that Kennedy was using the
*  lobby against Nixon in the early 60s and so on. Sorry. The more they see it's working,
*  the more they invest in this kind of system. So it sounds simple, but it's not that easy
*  to do this, but they perfect the system as they go along. They perfected it. They perfected
*  it, if one can use this term to say this. And then there is something that is added,
*  but I think that only comes after 67. It's not enough to have this connection with the
*  candidates and you hope of course that some of them would be really influential people
*  in the end of the day. They're adding two more elements which are very effective, taking
*  a very active role in presidential elections, almost as I show in the book, sometimes offering
*  to do the more dirty work for the candidates in order to smear the other candidate. And
*  secondly, they begin to understand that they need a permanent presence on Capitol Hill
*  and as one of them said to me, you needed that to remind our allies should they forget
*  who we are, it's good for them to pass over the door. He gave it a credible kind of image.
*  He said it was important for them to go next to a door to see one of their colleagues being
*  reprimanded by someone from the lobby for not doing their job. It's a system that needs
*  to be maintained at the level of intimidation also, definitely in the 60s and the 70s. I
*  think later on it's just by inertia, they're not worried. They think that people know what
*  they should say or should not say without any need to exert direct pressure on them
*  and you just have to deal with those who do not understand the message.
*  And of course they're highly funded. You have these figures, modern figures like Haim Sabah
*  and others, we're talking about massive amounts of money and the American system is a system
*  of legalized bribery. And if you defy the lobby, and we can, let's talk a little bit
*  about Senator Fulbright, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he decides
*  to investigate APEC's financial affairs and you can lay out what happens.
*  Absolutely. His main worry there is not anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli. He's worried of any foreign
*  country that interferes through lobbying in American policy because he's very much devoted
*  to shaping American foreign policy according to what he thinks are moral values and so
*  on. So he investigates professionally the lobby and what he reveals more than anything
*  else that the lobby is using money that supposedly is being recruited for the less fortunate
*  sections of the Israeli society. The money goes to Israel but instead of being invested
*  in the poorer areas of Israel, some of it, not all of it, some of it goes back to finance
*  the lobby itself, which is a total violation of the American law. And he publishes through
*  Newsweek his findings and then he becomes the art enemy of the lobby. And the way to
*  destroy someone is of course to help your, is to go and help the rival in the next election
*  for, he was a senator for the Senate. And I bring a quote from his writing, which is
*  a quote from his rival in Arkansas who says, well, you know, the Zionists filled my coffers
*  with money. I had no problem, I had no issue with money, he said in my elections, and he
*  defeats Fulbright. But it's more than that. They kind of defame him, destroy his reputation
*  and in many ways destroy his political career for exposing the less legal, the less legal
*  aspects of their activity. And he's one of many to come of course who would suffer a
*  similar fate for daring to challenge the lobby.
*  Before we go into where we are today, because it's an important point you make in the book,
*  the lobby used the arms sales to Jordan, we're talking about the other Arab countries as
*  a pretext for demanding more arms for Israel. Even today this quid pro quo continues to
*  be plan B for the lobby. You either stop arms sales to the Arab world or you concede
*  but demand compensation for Israel. Even after the Abraham Accords, this was under Trump,
*  a set of peace agreements between Israel, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco were concluded
*  in 2020. Arms deals for Arab countries continue to be balanced by more aid to Israel, making
*  sure the arms race never ended.
*  This is very interesting. What the lobby found out, that the arms industry in the United
*  States does have vested interests in the Arab world. And they are sacred to them. Maybe
*  their Arab clients, despite their support for Israel, they don't want to lose their
*  Arab clients. And the more some of their Arab clients, and I'm talking about states, not
*  about persons, some of these clients become richer and richer because of oil and petrol
*  and fossil energy. They can buy a lot of weapons. And therefore the lobby finds out that even
*  if Israel demands that a certain kind of very important weapons, or the most updated weapons,
*  would not be sold to Arab neighboring countries, the counter lobby of the arms industry, the
*  arms industry is powerful enough to convince presidents not to do that, despite the demands
*  of the lobby. So what they do, they say, okay, if we can't prevent sales to Jordan, we can
*  demand selling more weapons and more modern weapons, kind of cutting edge weapons to Israel.
*  So the kind of, and I call it the mentality of the lobby, you need to feel that you are
*  winning. Sometimes, I was very surprised, sometimes these demands to increase the weapons
*  supply or the arms supplies to Israel are not even a request that comes from Israel.
*  It is what I call the power for the sake of power. If they cannot do that, they might,
*  in their own eyes, they're losing their grip on the Congress. They're not powerful enough.
*  So sometimes they ask for more weapons to Israel in order to show to themselves that
*  they're still a very powerful lobby because they did not succeed in the first round to
*  prevent the arms sales to Saudi Arabia or Jordan. This is incredible because the more,
*  the longevity of this lobby is also its weakness because it becomes an animal by itself. It's
*  not only serving the interests of Israel. It is a powerful mechanism that is living
*  for power, enjoys power, and sometimes even forgets what the power is needed for and wants
*  to maintain the power as its main priority.
*  I think you argue at the end of the book that, and let's put it in the context of the current
*  genocide, where I think that the mask, Israel's attempt, and that you write about these, investing
*  all sorts of money to change perception, control, academic studies, intimidate the media, that
*  mask has really dropped away with this live streamed genocide. I don't think it's coming
*  back. But you argue at the end of the book that in essence the lobby is counterproductive
*  to Israeli interests itself. So let's talk about, since October 7th, the role of the
*  lobby, what it's done, and I think it's kind of spinning its wheels in the mud. I don't
*  think that it's working.
*  No, it's not. It kind of decided to frame as its enemies young people, conscientious
*  sections of the American civil society, minority groups, people who maybe, you know, people
*  mainstream America may consider some of them naive, but very few people would regard them
*  as immoral or enemies of the state. And this is the main problem of the lobby now. Its
*  enemies are people that actually have a spirit that in the past Americans used to admire.
*  Secondly, some of them belong actually to the American elites, definitely the students.
*  And the whole discourse that is brought, that the lobby is trying to fight, is immoral discourse.
*  And yes, you can bomb immoral discourse to a certain extent. We saw it in the pressure
*  to, you know, on the presidents of universities or Jewish alumni withdrawing money from certain
*  universities. You can still use money and force, but you don't really kill a movement
*  of solidarity that has the same impulses that the anti-Vietnam movement had, that the civil
*  rights movement had. You cannot kill it with money and therefore you're right. They're
*  stuck in the mud because it's not a question of convincing the American Congress to give
*  more money to Israel or sell more arms. Yes, they can still do that, but they have never
*  had the right methods, and they will never have, I think, the right weapons if you want,
*  to fight against systemic changes in public opinion that are based on moral values or
*  knowing the reality or, as you say rightly, on the daily images of a genocide. There is
*  a limit in the 21st century how much you can do that. And they don't have the kit of tools
*  anymore to deal with it. And therefore I don't think they will be succeeding unless other
*  factors would not change public opinion in the direction that I think it is changing.
*  And of course they still have the chunk of, call it the Trump, maybe the Trump base in
*  America. They can still unite with them. There's no need to pressure these guys. But they understand
*  that they are losing a very important section of the American, the divided American society.
*  And they've lost the facade. I mean they may get support from Trump, but they've lost that
*  facade. And just to buttress that point you're right, the way AIPAC decided who Israel's
*  enemies were often had very little to do with the actual policies, which were frequently
*  to Israel's advantage, they decided simply based on how obedient an administration was
*  to the lobby. America's endorsement of the Oslo Accords was not a milestone on the road
*  to peace for AIPAC, but a testimony to its own failure to influence American policy.
*  You make that point throughout the book, that it no longer becomes whether it's good or
*  bad for Israel, but they have to constantly assert their hegemony within the American
*  political system.
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think on the way they lost some of their own people, especially
*  those who were more bipartisan in their view, people who were more democratic, all came
*  from the Democratic party into AIPAC. You know, even Martin Indyk, who just passed
*  away this year, eventually was more against the lobby. And we remember him being a pillar
*  of the lobby.
*  He worked for AIPAC, didn't he?
*  He worked for AIPAC, and then he became quite a strong critic of AIPAC later on. So they
*  are even losing some of their own, you know, stars, if you want, of the past because they
*  are going too far as a kind of a mafia kind of organization.
*  So let's talk about, just to close, where you think we're headed. And I just want to
*  be clear, I mean, you've been, you and I have both been targeted, but this is not a disinterested
*  discussion. We have both been targeted by AIPAC. I think you were denied. Where was
*  it? You were...
*  I was detained in Detroit for two and a half hours, yes.
*  I was detained in Newark for about two and a half hours too, even though I had a valid
*  American passport. But let's talk about where you think we're headed. I mean, I think you
*  and this book and Merchammer's book are very, very important for people who want to understand
*  how the machinery works. Where are we going?
*  I think in terms of the lobbying in America in particular, but also in Britain, in a way,
*  I think the lobby is losing its efficiency and efficacy, although it still has the power,
*  of course, to change policies. And I think its major problem in America, and I'm not
*  an expert in American politics, but I think its major problem in America is that although
*  it allied itself now totally with the Republican Party, the Republican Party itself has very
*  strong elements of isolationism that even led to a very different kind of more careful
*  policy towards military aid to the Ukraine, not only to Israel. I think the main problem
*  for AIPAC is that not only Israel is not considered any more a moral asset to a young American
*  generation. I think the more cynical parts of the United States may not think about it
*  anymore as a strategic asset or economic asset, given the way Israel is imploding from within
*  its inability to deal with its own kind of right-wing, the emergence of strong right-wing
*  elements that are usurping the government and the state. And therefore, I think we're
*  heading into a very volatile chapter in the history of modern Israel and Palestine where
*  Israel is going to be a very fierce, cruel, brutal force whose victims will be mainly
*  Palestinians, but not only Palestinians. And it would be very difficult for American administration
*  to consider it as a reliable ally or an easy ally to deal with, although they would still
*  be committed because of their own interests in the area. But I think because of that,
*  the lobby would find it far more difficult to find allies because they are not as strong
*  as they are to find allies beyond Christian Zionists, the most basic base of Trump. They're
*  losing the Jewish community. They're definitely losing the young Jewish community. So in the
*  long run, I do think that lobbying for Israel and Zionism 10 or 15 years from now, the way
*  Israel is developing, would be a far more difficult job to do even in an America that
*  may not go the progressive democratic way, even if it for a while will go towards the
*  direction of Trump or the Republicans and so on. It's not an asset anymore for the cynical
*  Americans, for the more conscientious Americans. I think that we are witnessing the last chapter
*  in the history of that lobby. But I'm an historian. When I say last chapter, unfortunately it
*  means few years, not one year or two.
*  And how do you see the genocide playing out? I don't have an answer to that question, and
*  you may not either. How do you see it? What is the denouement of, what are we, 10, 11
*  months now?
*  Well, I'm afraid to say that the next 10, 11 months are much of the same in the sense
*  that Israel has taken half of its army out of the Gaza Strip, and it's now allowing
*  a kind of a nutrition war between itself and what remains of the military force of the
*  Hamas. I don't think they have a strategy beyond that because they are not willing to
*  go along with the idea, at least Netanyahu is not willing to go along with the idea of
*  replacing the Hamas with another Palestinian government or an Arab Palestinian government.
*  And anyway, I don't see the potential partners for this anyway. It's a genocide on the low,
*  less intensified one than we have seen, but it's incremental, it continues. And I think
*  in the end, and I don't know if it's a year or two or three years from now, it would be
*  something that important regional and international actors would not tolerate. They're still tolerating
*  it, but would not tolerate. Now, not tolerating the genocide could be a regional war with
*  Iran and Lebanon, maybe other factors. Not tolerating could be something we're hearing
*  now from the labor government, maybe from the back benches and so on, and we should
*  pay attention to this, of even people in the global states, in the global north, thinking
*  that Israel needs to be treated differently. We definitely already heard it from the ICJ
*  and the ICC. I really believe that Israel as it stands now doesn't stand a chance of
*  surviving in the long run as a Jewish state. But again, I'm warning that this, before that
*  would happen, before there is a collapse or disintegration, there is a very dangerous
*  period of that state trying to do all it can without any inhibitions to maintain its power,
*  its survival. And I'm very worried for the short run, including a continuation of the
*  genocide, and not just in Gaza, also in the West Bank. But I really think that if I were
*  a young Palestinian, I would hopefully believe that I'm young enough, hopefully, to see
*  something else in the more distant future. And I really believe in it, not just, you
*  know, it's not a wishful thinking, it's not a word of an activist, really it's someone
*  who follows the history of Israel and Zionism. I'm 100% convinced we are at the midst of
*  the last chapter in this Zionist project in Palestine. The last chapters are violent,
*  they are decolonization kind of chapters. I'm worried, and at the same time, I'm more
*  hopeful for the long distance. Great. That was historian, Ilan Papi, on his book, Lobbying
*  for Zionism on both sides of the Atlantic. It's a tremendous work. I devoured it whole.
