# Chris and Eiren Caffall Discuss Moby Dick, Greed and Death
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss)
*  Okay, we have to bring up Moby Dick. Okay. The greatest American novel, greatest American [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=0.0s)]
*  novel. My favorite and I could I could tell that because Moby Dick comes up more than [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=16.0s)]
*  Self-indulgent, but I couldn't help it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=24.36s)]
*  But it's a CLR James says Moby Dick is about the collapse of a civilization. Yeah, absolutely [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=27.8s)]
*  And I think I mean I'm obsessed with Nathaniel Philbrick's terrific book. Why read Moby Dick? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=32.96s)]
*  I recommend Moby Dick to everybody I ever talked to and all my school. Okay, I [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=39.32s)]
*  interviewed him about [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=43.56s)]
*  I interviewed Philbrick about Moby Dick. I also did the a show on the hundredth anniversary of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=44.68s)]
*  Publication of Ulysses with the Joyce scholar at Trinity College Dublin. I'm sure both of those shows got about five years [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=51.92s)]
*  I'm gonna go back and find them. I didn't find them. I was looking at your old shows. I'm gonna go searching [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Such a hero of mine [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's I think it's a quintessence [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=67.56s)]
*  I mean [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=70.28s)]
*  it's funny because the next novel that I'm writing has got a lot of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=70.72s)]
*  themes around labor in it and I just keep thinking I'm still thinking about all of the lessons from that book in terms of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=73.44s)]
*  The way that we talk about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=79.88s)]
*  utopias failed utopias collapse race [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=81.88s)]
*  in politics of work [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  The destruction of the natural environment and it's it's a book that I was it's so funny [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=86.96s)]
*  I hadn't thought about this until I was doing the companion essays for these two books to come out [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  But I realized that one of the first things that happened to me after I was diagnosed with my kidney disease [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=96.56s)]
*  was that my friend who's a brilliant scholar of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=102.56s)]
*  indigenous history teaches at Bryn Mawr [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=106.6s)]
*  But then we were just you know college friends high school friends. She handed me Moby Dick [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=109.32s)]
*  I had never read it and it was the first thing I read after this catastrophic experience in my own life and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=113.32s)]
*  Probably is the reason I read nothing but disaster novels for fun [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=119.68s)]
*  Or disaster books mostly nonfiction for fun [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=124.48s)]
*  But that everything that I needed to understand in terms of the way that Americans [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=128.24s)]
*  respond to the collapse of a culture is baked into that book and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=132.28s)]
*  I'm I'm just in love with it still [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's all there [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Including a hub yeah driving us towards extinction [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=143.92s)]
*  Yeah, and they and certainly star book there's a consciousness that he's driving them towards extinction [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=147.54s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and yet they can't extract themselves from it. No [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=153.32s)]
*  No, and I think that that is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=158.32s)]
*  So much more resonant every day that we are all [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=161.32s)]
*  in that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=165.88s)]
*  in that same circumstance where there are people in power who are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=167.12s)]
*  Driving us towards things and our agency feels very small and we're all just sort of along for this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=170.64s)]
*  white-knuckle [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=176.04s)]
*  you know [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=177.56s)]
*  Nantucket sleigh ride kind of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=178.92s)]
*  Experience of being driven towards a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=182.44s)]
*  Conclusion that we that isn't inevitable [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=186.24s)]
*  But that we're all choosing because we're not pushing back against the maniacal power at the center of the story [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=188.8s)]
*  I think that's a fundamental issue in Moby Dick. Yep [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=195.92s)]
*  Yeah, and and why why don't we push back? Yeah. Yeah, why I mean, but I'm asking you why why you think I mean [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=200.12s)]
*  I think that I [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=207.12s)]
*  Think that it's I mean the only thing I can think of at the moment is just what we're experiencing right now in American culture [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=210.12s)]
*  Right. We're not pushing back because we're trying to work around it. We're hoping for the best outcome [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=215.88s)]
*  we're hoping that appeasement of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=222.04s)]
*  The mania will work to slow [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=224.64s)]
*  The collapse or that if it doesn't it'll only affect just those of us on the boat [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=228.64s)]
*  You know if we get the white whale will be okay, and then things can go back to normal [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  There's the real well, let's just get this one [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=238.6s)]
*  One catastrophe out of the way and then we'll be all right kind of attitude [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=242.28s)]
*  That's that's part of the way that all of the characters rotate around that mania at the center of the book [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think living in America right now really feels like that right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=252.24s)]
*  We're all sort of rotating around a mania that we just don't know how to get out [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=255.24s)]
*  of the way of right [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=261.0s)]
*  How to how to affect it we push back in small ways in our daily lives. We we understand the complexity of what's happening [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=263.52s)]
*  But do we we really understand parts of it, you know [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=272.76s)]
*  and I think that's what's so great about the book is that I feel like each of the characters holds a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=276.0s)]
*  Portion of the complexity of the story that's part of why I love it so much is that this it's this spiderweb [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=279.88s)]
*  thinking way of looking at American life and American people and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=286.84s)]
*  I think that that would probably be true now each of us is holding a small part of it [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=292.8s)]
*  but the larger picture is unfolding around us until [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we're we're in the sea looking at the sinking ship [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you embrace Melville's belief that the deity is malevolent? Oh, no, I [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=305.08s)]
*  Don't I don't I I I? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=311.28s)]
*  I was raised probably too much around utopian thinkers and also I I believe in the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=316.12s)]
*  Maybe it's only 51 percent instead of 50 percent of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  the energy and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=330.24s)]
*  Power of nature and human experience tending towards good and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=332.24s)]
*  I think of that as the divinity as well the divinity is [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=337.72s)]
*  Complex, but it's it's lightly weighted towards towards justice. I [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=341.24s)]
*  Don't know if you know Mark Edelman's book shielding the flame [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=348.56s)]
*  No, I don't it was one of the deputy commanders of the Warsaw ghetto uprising the only one who survived and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  He [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  He was interviewed by a journalist named Hannah crawl and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  he said he became a cardiologist after the war and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=365.68s)]
*  after his experience in the uprising he felt the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=370.92s)]
*  Like Melville that the deity was malevolent and shielding the flame [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  He said he became a doctor because he he would cup his hand to shield the flame [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=379.16s)]
*  Our life our life as long as he could before it was snuffed out [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=384.48s)]
*  The [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=391.16s)]
*  You write that about greed [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  You know having gone to some of these elite schools [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=402.6s)]
*  Where you know, they tout such superior education [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=406.88s)]
*  Once these people enter the power elite [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=411.72s)]
*  It's it is greed [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=414.72s)]
*  They never have enough [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  Greed like that didn't start out bad what alters [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=421.16s)]
*  Wanting is what's behind it greed and hope aren't opposites greed and hope are twins [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  Grabbing for the same thing one in fear and one in faith. Yeah, explain what you mean by that. I [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  think that there's a baseline desire for protection for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=436.76000000000005s)]
*  Resources for [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=443.04s)]
*  Enoughness that's part of the human experience [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think that it necessarily breaks [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=450.16s)]
*  towards the good [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=454.68s)]
*  every time [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  but I think it's more prone to breaking towards the good if people aren't afraid and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=458.16s)]
*  I feel like I write towards that all the time in that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=464.12s)]
*  part of writing stories about death is that I think that people are more prone to being [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=468.6s)]
*  Afraid of death and that this anti-death [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=476.76s)]
*  cult that we've built here in America this [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=480.76s)]
*  idea of immortality through money or through life extensions or through perpetual youth is [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=483.64s)]
*  Bound up with an inability to tell a story about death that doesn't terrify folks and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=490.56s)]
*  I [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=496.4s)]
*  Have been in proximity to it for so long [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=498.04s)]
*  And so intimate with it in my own family and in my own body that I don't have that same narrative [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=502.11999999999995s)]
*  baked in I've had to question it and think about it and to become comfortable talking and feeling through [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  death and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=514.92s)]
*  I think the more stories that we tell that help people move away from that fear the more that we're going to reduce [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=516.92s)]
*  That sense of greed for the self for the small family for the small corporation [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=525.76s)]
*  Right for the thing that isn't collective for the thing where you know, I'm terrified that I'm going to die [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  So I have to make sure that I have everything I personally need [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=536.88s)]
*  and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  If we can do that if we can if we can [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=542.5200000000001s)]
*  Have more narratives that help soothe that fear. I think we're more protected. We we move away from greed [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=545.36s)]
*  We move towards hope [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=552.36s)]
*  In a more consistent way again, it only needs to be 51% [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=555.08s)]
*  I'm not saying we could eradicate it, but I think that we need to be able to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  Create those stories for the people who are open to them [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=565.24s)]
*  Doesn't that proximity to death teach you what is precious? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely and for me and you know much to my detriment that's never been about anything material [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  It's mostly about time, you know, and it's about family and and the people that I love and it's about your son [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=578.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean that's from your book your memoir. Yep. Yep. It is, you know [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=584.8s)]
*  deciding to have a child when you're told that you have a chance of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=590.24s)]
*  Them inheriting your disease and the disease that you watched to kill your father [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvi-QW_vss&t=594.1999999999999s)]
