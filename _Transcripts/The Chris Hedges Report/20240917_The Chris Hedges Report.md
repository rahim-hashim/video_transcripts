# Will Trump Really Fight the Deep State? (w Jimmy Dore)
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqklH37SkcY)
*  Well, it's where we live, Jimmy. Your circle is Hollywood and mine is Princeton, New Jersey.
*  These are the people who profit from the system. They are the managerial class. They are the
*  1%. I think much of the country actually does see it. I teach in the prison system. Certainly
*  all of my students and their families, most of whom don't vote because it doesn't make any
*  difference whether it's Biden or Trump. We still run the largest carcel system in the world. It
*  doesn't make any difference if you're a Palestinian if it's Biden or Trump. You touched on, I think,
*  correctly, this yearning which is real, the sense of betrayal which is real, that is fueling Trump's
*  candidacy. Of course, you're right. Trump is everything you said he is. But he is speaking,
*  in his own distorted, disingenuous way, to real issues. I think one of the things that I found so
*  chilling about the DNC is that it wasn't a reality-based event. We always talk about
*  Trump and magical thinking, but the Democratic Party wins the prize for magical thinking.
*  They won't even accept responsibility. Not only will they not accept responsibility for what they
*  did, they won't even acknowledge the reality that is literally outside their door. Yeah.
*  That's a great way to put it. It was not a reality-based event. That's a perfect way to put it.
*  I'm the only sliver of hope that you can, that I try to find a sliver of hope, otherwise I'll just
*  be depressed all day. My sliver of hope is that Donald Trump always wants credit for deals,
*  like his big thing. He didn't start a war. He did ramp up the drone war and he did
*  assassinate Soleimani and he did move the embassy to Jerusalem. He did a lot of those types of
*  things, but he didn't start a war. I've asked a lot of people, why do you think that is? Why do
*  you think he resisted bombing in Syria and then when he did, he just bombed a place that was
*  inconsequential and why he put the pause on the arms to Ukraine. My theory, again, this is my
*  sliver of hope, is that he wants to be seen as the guy who solved problems and he got the deal done.
*  He is all about deals and I think he has a distaste for calling up Gold Star families and telling them
*  that their kid is dead. I think as I've heard him described that he's New York real estate evil,
*  he's not deep state neocon evil. I think he does have a distaste for that and I think that
*  just like he had the over the top rhetoric with Kim Jong-un, if you remember, and then he was able
*  to do a deal, it reminds me like when I was a kid, I remember them saying, because Nixon had spent
*  his whole career being a red baiting maniac, that he was the only one who could go to China. I
*  remember them all saying that, well, only Nixon could because if anybody else went, he'd be
*  and created friendly relations. He would immediately be labeled a red and a lefty and a
*  puppet. Hopefully that's Trump's strategy is that he's like he did with Kim Jong-un. He speaks so
*  over the top, creating space for him to create a deal. I found an audio recording of Donald Trump
*  when he thought, when he first approached the Israel-Palestine issue, he thought the problem
*  was going to be with the Palestinians not wanting a deal. He found out that it was the
*  Palestinians who did want a deal and it was Bibi. In fact, in the recording, I think I'm quoting
*  verbatim, he said, after about three minutes of talking, I said, Bibi, you don't want a deal,
*  do you? He said, so Trump kind of figured that out and they did push the Abraham Accords.
*  So that was, I think, his attempt to get a deal. Maybe he has this over the top rhetoric
*  so he can enforce some kind of a deal. Maybe he's got that rhetoric because he wanted to get the
*  100 million from Ailson's widow, which he got. Maybe that creates space. He didn't have the
*  space with Russia because he didn't talk tough against Russia because there was no reason for
*  him to. I hope I'm being clear on what I'm saying. I'm not saying that's the case.
*  I'm saying that's the only sliver of hope we have because Kamala Harris is 100% in bed with the
*  deep state and the military industrial complex in Wall Street and the billionaire class and the WEF
*  and the people who actually run things. Because she doesn't, just like Joe Biden isn't running
*  things, she's not running things. She's being told what to do. So that's my only, I mean,
*  you have to, the deep state is, they've been trying to get rid of Trump since he started,
*  right? That's what Russiagate was about. That was collusion of the FBI, CIA, and the Hillary
*  Clinton campaign and the media to discredit him and get rid of him. That's what January 6th was.
*  How many cops were in the crowd? How many were dressed as MAGA supporters inside the Capitol
*  before the riot even started? The FBI won't tell you. So that was another Psy-op, right?
*  I'm convinced a lot of those Black Lives Matter riots were inspired by the FBI to create chaos.
*  Chaos always favors the establishment. They wanted to get rid of Donald Trump. And then the CIA lied
*  for about the Hunter Biden laptop. And there was 50 of them on a letter. But they're not doing that
*  for Trump. So at some point, he is somehow a thorn in the side of the deep state and the military
*  industrial complex. And like I said, I think it's because he has the stupid idea that the president
*  is supposed to control the military and the intelligence community. And they are letting
*  him know he is not in control, that there is a group of people who are in control. It is the deep
*  state. It is not the president. And if you don't serve them, just like Chuck Schumer said to Rachel
*  Maddow right in camera, is that if you don't do what the deep state wants, they have six ways to
*  Sunday to mess with you. And that means what Chuck Schumer revealed when he said that to Rachel Maddow
*  was that the president doesn't control the CIA, that the CIA and the FBI and the NSA doesn't work
*  for the president. And if they don't work for the president, the question then is exactly who do they
*  work for? Well, Rachel Maddow is never going to ask that follow up question. She's never even going
*  to point that out. But that's the obvious takeaway from that conversation that she had with Chuck
*  Schumer, who at the time was the leading Democrat in the country. So that's the only sliver of hope
*  is that they're trying to kill him. So somebody's trying to kill him. And that's my, I know that
*  sounds like a weird way to bring you hope, but that's it. I think that's a fascinating truth.
*  And it's clear that the leaks on Russiagate were coming from the intelligence community. And then
*  all the former intelligence clapper and all these figures could not be on MSNBC or any other network
*  fast enough to accuse Trump of being a Russian asset. And it's anecdotal, so I don't want to
*  pretend that it's fact. But I did speak to somebody who is close to Trump and told me that Trump's
*  greatest fear is that the CIA will take him out. And I think that there is a great deal of truth
*  to this antagonism. That doesn't, I don't share your sliver of hope with Trump. I'm just completely
*  bleak. But that is a fascinating dynamic. Because of course, the CIA is like the military, it's
*  uncontrollable. There's a historian, Arnold Toneby, who writes about the death, the creed chronicles,
*  the death of empires. And he said the common characteristic is that they have a military
*  industrial intelligence complex that goes rogue, that can no longer be controlled. And that's
*  certainly where we are. We perpetuate war, disastrous war. I mean, I just was reading about
*  a review of McMaster's new book where he trashes Trump. This was in the New York Times. And they
*  talked about his distinguished career as if Iraq wasn't a debacle, as if Afghanistan wasn't a
*  complete catastrophe, as if Libya was. I mean, so these people are responsible for, I would argue,
*  what's happened in the last two decades in the Middle East is probably even more damaging to
*  the empire than Vietnam. It's probably the worst strategic decision in American history,
*  for as another worth another show. And yet, no one is held accountable. And in some ways,
*  I'm not a Trump supporter, but remember that Trump called out the Iraq War as a disaster.
*  I mean, on the debate stage in front of Jeb Bush, he said what no one else was willing to say,
*  by at least among the political class of either party. Yeah, not only that, he gave the game away
*  about how he said, I used to be a donor. I used to come in and give them money and they did what I
*  said. And so I think that's maybe another problem for the donor class in him. But he is also such a
*  political novice that he will say a truth. So if you listen to CNN, they'll tell you the reason why
*  the establishment and they all hate Donald Trump is because he went to Washington, DC, and he
*  started lying. If you think that the establishment hates a politician because he went to Washington,
*  DC and started lying, I've got a vaccine I'd like to sell you. The reason why they hate Donald Trump
*  is because he's such a political novice and they can't control him that he every once in a while
*  will tell a big truth the president's not supposed to tell. And the biggest one he told was when he
*  was asked point blank, why are you leaving troops in Syria? And he said, for the oil, the oil secured,
*  it's our oil, we're taking the oil. And you can't say that. So now the whole world saw the president
*  say, give away the point of our foreign policy for the last 50 or 60 years is to invade smaller,
*  weaker countries and steal their natural resources. He's supposed to say this is
*  because Assad's oppressing his people and we're trying to keep the secure liberty for them. That's
*  what he's supposed to say. And he didn't, he just gave the game away. He said the same thing about
*  Venezuela recently at a campaign rally. He said, you know, Venezuela was ready to fall. We could
*  have had all that oil. We could have had all that oil. And he just says it. And so those are the
*  things that he is, as Aaron Maté says, that he puts an ugly face on imperialism. And that makes
*  it tougher for them to do their imperialism, especially since they've demonized them as a
*  white supremacist and a racist. It makes it much harder for them, so much easier for the military
*  industrial complex to have a guy like Barack Obama or a black woman like Kamala Harris. And
*  this is why I said, it'll be, you know, at least when a Republican is a president and he does wars,
*  sometimes the Democrats will go and protest him, right? But if it's Barack Obama, he dropped more
*  bombs than George Bush. Nobody noticed. Nobody said anything. They gave him a peace prize, right?
*  And Kamala Harris is set to do the exact same thing. So in that regard, it's worse for if Kamala
*  Harris becomes president because the left goes to sleep when a Democrat is president, especially
*  if it's a president of color.
*  Yeah, Glenn Ford, we lost a couple years ago, used to edit the Black Agenda Report, said the Democrats
*  aren't the lesser evil, they're the more effective evil. Well, look at Bill Clinton. He was able to
*  do things that George Bush at first was not allowed to do. He couldn't pass NAFTA, and then Bill
*  Clinton comes in, gives the Blue Dog Democrats cover. They cut the legs out from beneath organized
*  labor forever since, for a generation at least. And then he goes on to gut welfare, expand the
*  police state, explode the prison population, deregulate Wall Street, which crashed the economy
*  within 10 years. And who did that hurt most? The Black and Brown people. And then, of course, he
*  had a private deal, as Thomas Frank taught us, to end Social Security and privatize it. But thank
*  God for Monica Lewinsky, that didn't happen.
