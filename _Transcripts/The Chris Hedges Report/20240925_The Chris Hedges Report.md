Oftentimes the idea of “wokeness” or “woke” ideology, whether calling it as such or acknowledging its existence, can be thought of as coinage of the right wing. Christian Parenti, professor at John Jay College, journalist and author, joins host Chris Hedges on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to make the case that what he and many others define as “woke” is actually a weapon used to further suppress marginalized people, prevent the awareness of class politics and class struggle and further divide the working class.

# Wokeness Kills Class Politics and Empowers Empire (w Christian Parenti)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTpeQ4V-YeY)
*  Woke ideology is pervasive in liberal institutions, especially universities, but does it further
*  or hamper the liberal values and inclusiveness it purports to advocate?
*  It seeks to transform society through what Christian Parente calls the moralizing, micro-politics
*  of politicized etiquette.
*  It is fixated on the politics of language and symbols, the sins of cultural appropriation
*  and misnaming, and calls for centering historically oppressed groups.
*  It advocates identity politics, prioritizing race, gender, indigeneity, sexual orientation,
*  physical disability, mental health, diagnoses, immigration status, and socioeconomic status
*  over political content.
*  Woke discourse, Parente writes, is imbued with a therapeutic mentality expressed in
*  a safety-obsessed incantations about harm, trauma, healing, care, and doing the work.
*  Personal struggles take precedence over political struggles, but as Parente argues, wokeness
*  is deeply anti-intellectual, endowed with a moralizing that draws a distinction between
*  the politically clean and unclean, friend and enemy, good and evil.
*  It demands the censoring and canceling of the politically incorrect along with books
*  and ideas.
*  Woke culture has displaced old-fashioned, universalist class politics, the fundamental
*  struggles over who produces wealth, how and for whom.
*  It not only divides the working class, but often serves the interests of the ruling class.
*  Joining me to discuss woke culture is Christian Parente, professor of economics at John Jay
*  College, University, and author of the recent article, The Cargo Cult of Woke.
*  Okay, let's begin with the title, Christian, The Cargo Cult of Woke, where participants
*  believe that social justice and perhaps even revolution can be achieved through the performance
*  of safety-oriented rituals of political etiquette.
*  So let's define it, what it is.
*  Well, I mean, your introduction helped kind of define it, but it's, you know, I see it
*  as having basically six key features.
*  It's this, as you said, this micro politics of etiquette.
*  I mean, it's, we're not going through all six of them.
*  Woke is the sub, the dominant subculture of the left now, and it is highly destructive.
*  If you critique it on the left, a lot of people deny its existence.
*  There's no such thing as woke-ness.
*  There's only, or woke culture or cancel culture, there's only accountability culture.
*  But indeed, wokeness is a real thing and it's a real problem for the left.
*  So in this article, which was for Catalyst, the journal associated with Jacobin Magazine,
*  a cousin, sister institution, maybe.
*  It's a review essay of several books that came out over the last year about wokeness.
*  Some of them from the left, some of them from the right, even far right, and some of them
*  sort of center.
*  And I go through their explanations and try and unpack them.
*  And there's actually a second half of this, which the article in its first draft was too
*  long and a lot of it was left on the cutting room floor, which I'm currently turning into
*  another article, which gets kind of deeper into the history of how the left arrived at
*  this. But the main problem with wokeness is that it effectively purports to offer
*  total transformation of society, even revolution.
*  But it is in reality, it comes at the expense of universalist class politics that seek
*  to redistribute wealth and seek to change how wealth is created, you know, and
*  seeks to grapple with the questions of how wealth is produced, you know, by whom and
*  for whom. Right. Those questions drop away.
*  And frequently, woke ideology purports to want to arrive at the same place.
*  Many proponents of woke will even claim to be socialists and Marxists.
*  But I argue that in reality, it doesn't add up to class politics.
*  And it really more often than not comes at the expense of good old universalist class
*  politics. And the great irony, one of the greatest ironies in all of this is that it
*  is, in fact, universalist class politics that delivers the most for whatever
*  hyper-variegated subgroup of the most oppressed there is.
*  That might sound snide, but I don't mean it that way.
*  So as I say in the article, if black trans people suffer disproportionately
*  from unemployment, lack of medical care, lack of adequate housing, et cetera, the
*  irony is that universal provision of those goods would disproportionately benefit
*  the most marginalized black trans people, for example.
*  Right. We see that logic at work in Social Security.
*  Everyone pays into Social Security, though the rich, of course, stop paying after
*  whatever it is like one hundred and seventy thousand dollars.
*  Maybe it's one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
*  So only that's the first hundred and fifty K you're taxed on.
*  But the point is, everybody pays into Social Security according to their ability.
*  And then everyone receives Social Security, both millionaires and elders who otherwise
*  would be homeless. And who benefits disproportionately from the Social Security
*  check? The poor, the poorest benefit disproportionately for the millionaires and
*  multimillionaires. Whatever Social Security pays them is doesn't doesn't have a
*  material impact on their life. It's not that important.
*  But the average working class senior, that check is transformative if they didn't
*  have that millions of them would be homeless.
*  So that I think that's an important thing to keep in mind when arguing for and
*  considering a return to or an amplification of a universalist class politics.
*  That it is, in fact, very good for all of the ultra oppressed groups who are that that
*  woke ideology purports to serve more efficiently and and foreground most.
*  And I think, in other words, the long story short is that woke doesn't deliver on its
*  own goals.
*  Well, it's even as you write as you write in the article, it's even pernicious in the
*  sense that it's become a bludgeon in the hands of the corporate state.
*  You call it authoritarian and profoundly anti intellectual.
*  You write others on the left privately bemoan wokeness and its safety obsession, but in
*  public remain quiet for fear of attack from woke online mobs.
*  I think this is especially true in universities.
*  At Princeton, for instance, that woke culture has banned the great black novelist
*  Richard Wright as a misogynist.
*  And so they don't teach him.
*  But let's talk about that authoritarianism and anti intellectualism.
*  Yes. I mean, I open the article with a recent example of the anti intellectual and
*  authoritarian nature of woke ideology.
*  The the American and Canadian Anthropological Association at their annual meeting canceled
*  unilaterally from the executive committee canceled a previously approved panel called
*  Let's Talk About Sex Baby, the Enduring Importance of Biological Sex to Anthropology.
*  And their explanation was that, well, this would be this would cause harm to trans and
*  LGBTQ members of the association.
*  I mean, that is that's kind of bonkers that that the anthropological association doesn't
*  want to have a panel discussing, contemplating, grappling with what role should biological
*  sex play in the discipline.
*  Right. And they didn't do it by some membership vote.
*  It was done last minute after scheduling the panel from the top down.
*  So I mean, that's an example of the woke authoritarianism.
*  But I mean, it's everywhere in that it's one of the preferred strategies these days, this
*  cancel culture of online mobs, targeting a person, going to their employers, their funders,
*  whatever, and trying to get them fired, canceled, etc.
*  And we saw this with countless, countless people, many of whom deserved it.
*  But it also can run amok.
*  So that's how it's authoritarian.
*  And it's anti intellectual in that it has this intolerance that you are not allowed to
*  explore if you're if you're going to stay in the good graces of woke ideology and those who
*  report it, you can't ask difficult questions.
*  You have to sort of assume the right language, etc, etc.
*  I mean, it's also just incredibly divisive.
*  One of the books discussed is Yash Gomolk's book, The Identity Trap.
*  And he has some really surprising examples of just like racially segregating five year old
*  kids in some elite private school is a number of examples of this kind of like just racist.
*  But in the name of anti-racism segregation of young people in private schools, but also
*  examples of this in public schools, you just wonder like, how could that be legal?
*  So in that regard, it's incredibly divisive.
*  And, yeah.
*  Well, you'll quote Adolf Reed at the end, and he refers to this anti-racism as class
*  politics, I think, explain that idea.
*  And also this, you note that it while it woke politics professes concern for the downtrodden,
*  you say it's right in content because it is compatible with economic exploitation.
*  Yeah. So an example of that is that I cite in the article is how the CIA had these online
*  ads called Humans of the CIA.
*  One of them was a Latino who has this amazing, like flawless woke-
*  OK, you got to read it.
*  Do you have it in front of you?
*  If not, I'll read it.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty.
*  Pretty remarkable.
*  OK, here we go.
*  Humans of the CIA.
*  So this is what she says.
*  She says, I'm a cisgender millennial who has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety
*  disorder. I'm intersectional, but my existence is not a box checking exercise.
*  I did not sneak into CIA.
*  My employment was not and is not the result of a flute or a slip through the cracks.
*  I used to struggle with imposter syndrome, says the spy.
*  But at 36, I refuse to internalize misguided, patriarchal ideas of what a woman can or
*  should be. Right.
*  So this is from the CIA, an organization that goes around overthrowing governments,
*  assassinating people, and we should say has a long history of meddling in American
*  politics and an American culture in very destructive ways.
*  So if the CIA can try to legitimize itself with wokeness, then that really shows you
*  kind of how how flexible it is in terms of its relationship to power.
*  Another thing came to mind, another example, this was Jamie Raskin a year or so back
*  talking about how when ramping up to the war in Ukraine, how Putin was a homophobe and
*  transphobe and all this sort of stuff.
*  This is like, you know, here is woke ideology in the service of a U.S.
*  proxy war.
*  So it is completely compatible with all of that.
*  And and actually, it's not just compatible.
*  I mean, it's it's it's actually pretty useful to the American empire to legitimize it,
*  to return some sort of patina of moral legitimacy to it.
*  And in terms of Adolf Reed, you know, at the end, there's a section where I discuss how
*  the professional managerial class embraces wokeness.
*  So you have from, you know, from the end of World War Two to the present, the kind of
*  old petty bourgeoisie of the small shopkeepers and independent businesses is increasingly
*  absorbed into the corporate structure, structures of universities, corporations, this kind
*  of stuff. And that, you know, that there are a class emerges, a class of workers, it
*  should be said, they're fundamentally just workers.
*  But they're a political constituency different from blue collar workers, right.
*  The professional managerial class that has is its task, managing some piece of a hierarchy.
*  No sooner does this class emerge and grow by the 60s and 70s than does it also start to
*  experience a new kind of precarity.
*  There is by the end of the 70s, the first experiments in what we now recognize as neoliberal
*  economic restructuring, beginning with the Volcker Shock of 1980 in economics.
*  There's massive deregulation, tax cuts that facilitate the upward redistribution of wealth,
*  massive deindustrialization, an expansion of the financial sector.
*  And with all of that, the the rhythm of the economic cycles of capitalism increases.
*  You have more frequent and more extreme booms and bubbles.
*  And connected to that, all that, you have an increase in the creative destruction of
*  the capitalist economy throughout the West, but particularly in the United States.
*  And that means that this professional managerial class, pretty much as soon as it reaches
*  its peak form, also finds itself under all sorts of stresses.
*  The company that the company worked for is now likely to be bought out and restructured.
*  And so people are constantly struggling to maintain their position.
*  You see it very clearly in academia.
*  You know, the number of adjuncts has increased massively in academia.
*  While the overall number of faculty has kept up with and matched the number of students,
*  the number of tenured professors has shrunk radically and the amount of people working
*  on short term contracts has increased enormously.
*  That introduces an intense precarity and fear of falling, as Barbara Ehrenreich put it in
*  her great book by that title.
*  And so woke ideology, wokeness serves as an armory, an arsenal for the professional
*  managerial class to draw weaponry and armor from in their increasingly Hobbesian war of
*  all against all for posts.
*  And that is an important kind of material incentive for what drives this.
*  And that there are there are real material stakes for people.
*  And one way a professional manager, member of this class can can get ahead is by by
*  using these tropes to advance themselves and defend themselves.
*  But you say in the process, you say it erases class politics.
*  Yeah, well, it erases it erases the larger class politics of thinking about one's
*  relationship to the means of production.
*  Does your income.
*  Is it derived from the ownership of capital or is your income primarily from the sale
*  of your labor, be that labor unskilled or highly skilled?
*  It's still fundamentally the same kind of relationship that a worker, be they be they
*  a highly trained doctor or a ditch digger has to the business.
*  Right. It's fundamentally different from owning the business and opening your dividend
*  statements once a month and cashing checks.
*  And of course, there's a hybrid.
*  This is a kind of ideal type.
*  Right. Many workers also receive a little bit of income through ownership of capital
*  through their 401k, etc.
*  Right. And there are plenty of rich people who also work and get high wages as managers
*  and owners of businesses, etc.
*  But that's the fundamental question at the heart of class politics.
*  And all that gets erased by wokeness because all these other questions, which are important,
*  I'm not saying they're not important, but all these other questions that crowd out the
*  class question and purport to be headed in the same direction, they promise that they're
*  going to end up improving the material conditions of people.
*  Except based on these variegated subsets.
*  And this is fundamentally the logic of Madison's Federalist Ten, Divide et Impera.
*  Right. And he says in Federalist Ten that he's answering elites who are concerned that
*  the Constitution, if ratified, will empower the people too much.
*  Right. And Madison says, no, no, don't worry about that.
*  The only danger that the Constitution has is that the people who are in power will be
*  the only danger is if all of the property lists come together and unite.
*  That's when there's a threat that they could use political democracy.
*  But the good news is that there's always faction, as he calls it, in society.
*  And there's division around religion, around geography, around different types of
*  trade, around class questions.
*  Right. The biggest source of faction, he says, is that of property between the haves and
*  the have nots. Right. But the solution to preventing the use of the
*  democratic process for class struggle is to divide the majority, what we would call
*  the working class, to divide what he's considering the properties, to divide them in
*  as many subgroups as possible.
*  And a lot of this arises naturally.
*  And when necessary, there can be nudges and there can be the facilitation of
*  deeper division. That's fundamentally what woke politics is about.
*  It continues that kind of divi de et impera.
*  And what Adolf Reed means when he talks about he actually should be said does not like
*  the term woke. You see things, it's a coinage of the right.
*  I disagree, obviously.
*  But what he says about identity politics is that it is a class politics and it's in
*  both those senses. It's a politics, a class politics because it obscures the
*  fundamental relationship between the working class and the owning class, the
*  ruling class, the capitalist class and workers.
*  It obscures that. But it's also a class politics because it's the politics of a
*  class that is the professional managerial class, sort of mid-level elites who use
*  these questions to find positions for themselves and accumulate power and then
*  protect those posts.
*  Let's explain to us what Monk means when he calls the use of the term identity
*  synthesis. This is his term for the woke mentality.
*  And then also talk about the rise of all these new academic centers and departments
*  that are focused on questions of identity.
*  Well, I mean, what Monk does not, none of these authors discuss really flesh out
*  what they mean by woke ideology.
*  And so, you know, what what Monk means is the identity synthesis is is kind of, you
*  know, intersectionality to some extent.
*  It's the it's this hyper focus on the nature of one's identity and and then
*  building a politics out from that, that always returns to that.
*  And in terms of these academic centers, you see a lot of the books that I
*  discussed are written by academics.
*  And one of my critiques is that these academics perhaps overemphasize the role
*  of academia in all of this.
*  But there has been a rise since the 60s of these academic centers that are not
*  departments, which is important in a number of ways.
*  One thing that Monk doesn't talk about is that, you know, traditionally, the
*  university was self-governed and there has been a change since World War Two where
*  the administration has gotten bigger and bigger.
*  There's a great book about this by Benjamin Ginsburg, who's a professor, married
*  down at Johns Hopkins and it's called The Fall of the Faculty, The Rise of the
*  All-Administrative University.
*  But one of the ways that the faculty who were who still are a very privileged
*  group of workers, but much less so as as our ranks, as tenure is eliminated or
*  placed with adjunct labor.
*  But one of the ways that the faculty are weakened is instead of channeling
*  resources to departments, academic departments that are still self-governing
*  and often kind of little democracies, contentious, often terrible places to work.
*  Not the one I work at, which is a great place.
*  But these centers dispense with all that bureaucracy.
*  You don't have like faculty voting on hires, faculty voting on curriculum changes.
*  These centers usually are built around one charismatic individual and they appeal to
*  funders and the funders have undue influence, direct influence on the content of what is
*  going to be researched, presented to the public, etc.
*  And what gets funded, surprise, surprise, is not working class politics, the class
*  struggle, anti-imperialist organizing.
*  It is this divisive politics of ever more rarefied subsets of identity.
*  And so that's a big part of what helps push wokeness is because those are where the jobs
*  are and that's where the jobs are, because that's where the money from elites is going.
*  Right. And if you look at the website of the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller
*  Brother Foundation or any of these foundations, I mean, just look, do keyword search for
*  social justice.
*  Right. The modern left in the United States is heavily, heavily dependent on these
*  foundations, which are themselves the tools of the American ruling class funded by
*  fortunes built on the backs of coal miners and fossil fuel exploitation, etc.
*  And these foundations are not established to and are not seeking to overthrow undue
*  or transform American capitalism.
*  They are fundamentally about legitimizing and perpetuating it.
*  And they have become very adept at using rhetoric that at first glance, you hear echoes
*  of the 60s, at first glance, I go, this is quite radical.
*  But you realize it's not.
*  It's totally compatible with the increasingly unequal class hierarchy that is our society.
*  Go ahead.
*  Another material force behind all this is the law.
*  And the last book I discussed is actually by a really a pretty odious right winger,
*  Richard Hananya, who was a self-admitted former racist.
*  But his book, I must say, makes an interesting point.
*  He says that a lot of what essentially woke culture is downstream from the law,
*  specifically the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which he doesn't like and would like to get rid of.
*  But this is the interesting part of his argument.
*  He says it's the weakness of the law that sort of perpetuates wokeness.
*  What's he talking about?
*  Well, the Civil Rights Act allows for private sector enforcement in the civil courts,
*  and it has incredibly vague parameters.
*  For example, for some reason that I'm honestly not quite clear on,
*  hiring quotas have always been taboo in the United States.
*  This is, I believe Eisenhower said, you know, when first being confronted with civil rights
*  legislation in the military, that as long as there weren't any quotas, right?
*  And ever since then, maybe it was even Truman, but ever since then, this idea has stuck.
*  But in fact, there are quotas, there are informal quotas.
*  And so part of what you learn in modern academia is this kind of lying and double standards.
*  Anyway, so in the vagueness of this law, and it compares it to some extent with what's going on in France.
*  In France, for example, there are certain laws against discrimination.
*  For example, French firms have to hire a certain percentage of disabled workers.
*  This is a quota.
*  It's set by the labor ministry and the labor ministry enforces it.
*  Right. In the United States, we don't have anything like that.
*  That would be illegal.
*  But instead, what we have is a law that says you as a worker or consumer person, you can sue
*  institutions if you've been discriminated against.
*  And so this leads to there's all I should interrupt myself for a second.
*  There is also enforcement of civil rights law violations by the federal government.
*  But a lot of the enforcement is left up to the private sector.
*  So what has happened over recent decades is that corporate America has been faced with really expensive
*  lawsuits, you know, one hundred, two hundred million dollars at times by basically like, I think it's like
*  ninety five percent of the Fortune 500 firms have had to pay out pretty significant damages for various
*  types of racial and sexist discrimination.
*  Right.
*  So what do they do to defend themselves?
*  Well, they start investing in the the the HR infrastructure and the outsourced HR infrastructure of
*  diversity consultants and trainers, et cetera, et cetera.
*  And they do this in hopes that they won't have that they can.
*  You know, extirpate the racist and sexist managers or at least the mentality of managers who might have
*  those attitudes, get them to shut their mouths and stop costing the company money.
*  But if that fails, they also have a defense because they look, you know, to the court, they say, look,
*  we invest heavily in trying to create an inclusive workspace.
*  So that's a huge amount of money that goes to people like Ibram X.
*  Kendi and Robin D'Angelo.
*  And there's an entire industry.
*  People make a fairly good living doing this kind of training around these woke ideas and
*  inculcating also it's not just ideas and arguments, it's a whole kind of sensibility.
*  Right. That's why it's a subculture.
*  It's like concern with etiquette and aesthetics is absolutely important in it.
*  And so that's part of why corporate America, why is corporate America going to this?
*  It's like to defend themselves against lawsuits because because of the history of 95 percent of the
*  Fortune 500 companies having had to pay out large damage settlements because of their bigotry.
*  Right. So they invest heavily in in this private sector entrepreneurial infrastructure.
*  And so then these this cadre of experts, of course, see the need for their services
*  everywhere. And as a result, you get certain kind of left ideas from social sciences
*  extracted and distorted.
*  For example, the idea of structural racism has become the notion of systemic racism.
*  Structural racism is the idea that there are racist outcomes even when there isn't racist intent.
*  That structures like housing markets, educational funding systems that are partly
*  dependent on property values, how this can lead to unfair outcomes for different demographic
*  groups. Right. Systemic racism is the idea that racism is in everywhere, is everywhere and in
*  everyone and that everything is racist.
*  The two sound similar. Structural racism, systemic racism.
*  What's the difference? They're actually very different.
*  So now this cadre that can siphon up money, not just from universities and foundations, but also
*  from the private sector, is constantly pushing these ideas and this sensibility.
*  And that's a very important part of where it all comes from.
*  Another part of where it comes from, which I left out of the piece, but if I were to do it again and
*  had more time, more space, the Obama administration plays a very important role in this.
*  Monk notes that the mainstream press turns woke in around 2010, that all this predates Trump.
*  This is not just a reaction to Trump, but that the use of terms like systemic racism increases by
*  orders of magnitude in the New York Times, usage of it in the New York Times, in the Washington
*  Post, et cetera.
*  And while he doesn't get into this, Laura Kipnis does in her book, which is not one of the books
*  that is reviewed here, called Unwanted Advances.
*  And that she shows how the Obama administration's interpretation of Title IX and the use of what it
*  called Dear Colleague Letters, really kind of set off a kind of sex panic on campuses that
*  she documents in a critical fashion.
*  And that's a very good book.
*  But I think that's a very important part of the kind of explosion of woke, as well as those Obama
*  administration Dear Colleague Letters about how Title IX is to be interpreted.
*  Let's talk about social media.
*  Lest it be misunderstood.
*  So, Hanani, he wants to get rid of civil rights law.
*  That's a terrible idea.
*  But what I argue in this piece is that the evidence he shows can be used for the exact
*  opposite conclusion, which is that actually maybe what we need is a clearer, stronger
*  civil rights law.
*  We need to have a larger role for government and maybe a discussion about quotas, since we
*  informally have them, but we deny it, and to get rid of this whole private sector,
*  entrepreneurial propulsion system for woke ideology.
*  I want to talk about social media and the, you're quoting Monk, the rise of a popularized version
*  of the identity synthesis, the transform the ideas of serious thinkers, he's probably thinking of
*  Foucault, into simplistic memes and slogans.
*  Yes.
*  What's the question in that?
*  Like what?
*  I want to know how that works.
*  I mean, what's happened?
*  What's happened?
*  So you have figures like Edward Said and Foucault and others, but it's the reductionism,
*  how they're very complex often, and especially with Edward, nuanced ideas are reduced to a
*  simplistic formula to serve woke culture.
*  Well, I mean, that happens.
*  I don't think that Monk's account of that is particularly good.
*  All of the academics take up this case against post-structuralism, and I mean, they have a point.
*  What happens, but the thing they leave out is the following.
*  What happens simultaneously with the arrival of post-structuralism from Europe in the late 70s,
*  early 80s, simultaneously, there is the legacy of McCarthyism, right?
*  The background of all this has to be understood, the impact of the Red Scare.
*  Taft-Hartley, so in the second half of this article, which I'm working on now, is almost done,
*  I get into the role of Taft-Hartley.
*  This is very important.
*  Taft-Hartley doesn't just weaken organized labor in a quantitative sense, but also qualitatively
*  undermines all sorts of practices of solidarity that help build class consciousness.
*  Let me just interrupt to explain.
*  This is the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, which essentially prohibits any kind of sympathy strike.
*  It absolutely cripples the ability of striking workers to have any kind of impact.
*  Right. Boycotts, sympathy strikes, these kinds of things.
*  Communists are purged from the CIO.
*  The Smith Act, where socialist politicians are actually prosecuted.
*  You've got McCarthyism and the Red Scare.
*  This continues on.
*  You've got then the blossoming of this kind of radicalism of the New Left.
*  Pretty quickly thereafter, there is very serious red baiting.
*  All the way through, there's red baiting within the universities.
*  Lots of Marxists lose their jobs in university.
*  So what happens is that this new radical theory from Europe arrives, which is a reaction, for
*  example, from the pen of Foucault.
*  Foucault is a member of the French Communist Party for a while, but in the 50s, the French
*  Communist Party was hegemonic among intellectuals.
*  It didn't always have good ideas and then have a kind of bureaucratized culture.
*  There's plenty about that project to critique.
*  So Foucault is part of a generation of left intellectuals who become increasingly anti-communist
*  while promoting new kinds of radicalism.
*  So that's what Foucault is taken up for in the US and others.
*  As a vacuum is created by the continued red baiting and blacklisting of professors.
*  My father was one of these people.
*  He was a Yale-educated PhD and was treated very well until in the 60s, his students started
*  radicalizing him and he became a radical and a Marxist and thereafter found it very, very
*  hard to get and keep jobs.
*  A lot of Marxists had this experience.
*  And let me just interject that you're talking about Michael Parente.
*  Your father's also written several great books.
*  But Ellen Schrecker has done, if you want to read about the history of how brutal these
*  purges were right down to the high school level where the FBI would show up at a high
*  school with a list and no questions asked, no evidence.
*  Suddenly, not only did all those teachers lose their jobs, but they couldn't get hired
*  anywhere else.
*  So that's a moment in American history that's extremely important.
*  And Ellen Schrecker wrote two good books, Snow Ivory Tower and Such Were the Crimes,
*  I think is the name of the other one.
*  But she's chronicled that history.
*  And I didn't know how pervasive that blacklisting was until I read those books.
*  So that creates an atmosphere of hostility and a vacuum.
*  And then into it come these enticing new ideas about how well there's a different kind of
*  revolution and radicalism that focuses on the micro politics of resistance and the
*  politics of identity, et cetera, et cetera.
*  And part of the critique that makes this post-structuralist wave so appealing is that
*  it's a, we'll look at what Foucault's argument is that Marxism is this incredibly powerful
*  theory and it's essentially the height of the enlightenment and Western metaphysics.
*  And it nonetheless, in the hands of the Soviet state produces, helps produce the gulags.
*  Right?
*  So the problem is making any kind of sweeping truth claims.
*  And so you have to push back against that and kind of like shatter the, you know,
*  shatter epistemology and knowledge into smaller pieces.
*  And this became very useful and very appealing to academics because it was a way of being radical,
*  a way of being subversive.
*  And also a way of speaking to real problems.
*  There really is racism.
*  There really is sexism.
*  Right?
*  Disabled people really are mistreated and shunned.
*  Right?
*  So you can talk about real problems and be radical and propose radical transformations
*  without confronting the class hierarchy of the society, which is, you know,
*  where the power really lies.
*  It's not that these other issues aren't important.
*  They are.
*  But it's like in most cases, the solutions to those problems require the redistribution
*  of resources, which only comes when the ruling class, the capitalist class,
*  the owning class are confronted.
*  Right?
*  And so post structuralism allows academics to pursue a kind of left politics that minimizes,
*  in some cases, is even openly hostile to a class analysis and to class struggle.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So what I mean, a lot of this story comes down to detaching class struggle from cultural
*  struggles.
*  And what woke is, is the continuation of all of the goals of the Enlightenment left,
*  but in the realm of culture war, in the realm of cultural struggles.
*  And that material conflict is increasingly elided and erased.
*  And isn't it done through the twin evils of relativism and subjectivity?
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure I would call them evils.
*  I mean, because, you know, but that's, but those are the methods for sure.
*  It's like, so yeah, the question becomes subjectivity and a kind of moral relativism
*  is introduced, which is, you know, at first glance, it's about, you know, undermining
*  that the bigoted ideologies that had dominated in the West and say, well, no, it's like,
*  there's all sorts of different ways of being.
*  And, you know, homosexuality is not a mental illness.
*  Right.
*  And everyone deserves full civil rights.
*  Right.
*  So that's, there's some important work that's done by relativism say, well, you know,
*  just because your worldview is such that you think this is a sin doesn't mean you're right.
*  You just have a point of view and there are all sorts of other points of view.
*  So I think there's something useful in that, but it is deployed to undermine the
*  Marxist socialist tradition.
*  Well, that's, you know, it's reductive.
*  It's this, you know, meta theory and it's essentialist and we want to
*  explode things and be more playful than that.
*  And in terms of the subjectivity, yes, that's huge.
*  And another part of that kind of what goes with subjectivity is the therapeutic term.
*  And that's something that's in the second part of the essay, right?
*  You have at the end of World War II, most psychologists, psychiatrists work in
*  institutions, but there's a massive deinstitutionalization of the profession
*  prior to the deinstitutionalization of the patients that happens in 70s and 80s.
*  But there's a deinstitutionalization of psychology and post-war psychology
*  turns away from just dealing with crippling mental illness and it starts trying to heal
*  regular people and, you know, find pathology everywhere.
*  And there's, you know, an explosion of this stuff and you see it taking on
*  a rather malign form, unfortunately, in the new left.
*  This is the second half of this essay, which is not published yet, but
*  you get the rise of these like politicized therapy groups.
*  There's one I've written about elsewhere called re-evaluation counseling, which comes out
*  Harvey Jackins, who was one of the founders actually of Scientology.
*  He was sued by L. Ron Hubbard for stealing a lot of Hubbard's ideas and re-evaluation
*  counseling is still very big on the left.
*  It's associated from 1971 onward, increasingly with the movement for a new society,
*  which is a group of, comes out of sort of like Quaker movements and they are,
*  they advocate collective living and they're very, very involved in the movement for a new society,
*  is very, very involved in the anti-nuke struggles and the Central American solidarity struggles
*  and then the anti-globalization struggles and then they disband, but their influence is still there
*  in this kind of anti-communist, but very radical, quasi-anarchist, but detached from the traditional
*  anarchist theories and they are all also very influenced by Gene Sharp, who is the,
*  one of the best known proponents of revolutionary nonviolence, but unlike King and Gandhi,
*  he's secular, he doesn't have like a religious cosmology and morality driving him.
*  His approach to revolutionary nonviolence is very technocratic and he's actually spends
*  the first 30 years of his career at a defense department funded think tank.
*  He is not necessarily directly funded by the defense department, but this think tank at Harvard
*  called the Center for International Affairs. When he arrives there, Henry Kissinger
*  is one of the co-directors and the US defense establishment uses Sharp's ideas to basically
*  build out the color revolution toolkit. So those same kind of ideas are increasingly permeating the
*  new left. Re-evaluation counseling is just one example of the stuff these encounter groups like
*  the radical women's liberation movement in the late 60s begin these encounter groups and
*  Cesar Chavez famously gets wrapped up with one of these kinds of like basically cults, synanon.
*  So subjectivity becomes a battleground for the left and from the 60s on, it's seen that
*  individual subjectivity is in many ways the path forward for larger social change. You could argue
*  that it's the other way around, that people's subjectivity changes when the structures they're
*  embedded in change. I mean, of course it's a bit of both, but anyway, so that whole
*  psychological turn within the society and then within the new left is a very important part of
*  the origins of woke. There's a small point, but I think an important one. You talk about the avoidance
*  that causes left intellectuals to brag openly about not reading their political enemies.
*  It's itself an expression of woke secular religiosity. The right is haram.
*  Do not touch it. At least you two become unclean. So there's all sorts of figures who I don't
*  necessarily agree with. Karl Popper, I have huge issues with Reinhold Niebuhr, and yet these
*  intellectuals deeply have informed my own understanding of the world around me, although
*  I'm not always in tune with them. I think that essentially by bifurcating the world into those
*  who are acceptable and those who are not, it is anti-intellectual, intellectually stunting. It
*  stunts us. Yes, and anti-intellectualism and authoritarianism are deeply linked.
*  One saw this during COVID. There was zero discussion of any discussion of any kind of
*  discussion of any descent from the official line around any of these measures. Lockdowns,
*  the use of experimental vaccines, mandates firing people who didn't want to take these vaccines.
*  There was no discussion on the left about this. Go back and search the pages of Jacobin. Search
*  the pages of Catalyst in which this article appears. Search any left journals pages. There
*  was no critical discussion about any of that. In fact, that facilitated what I consider to be
*  intensely authoritarian and destructive policies. That's just one example of how
*  anti-intellectualism facilitates authoritarianism. If you're not allowed to think, if you're not
*  allowed to read certain authors and let your mind wander, you're going to end up in a very sterile,
*  repetitive cul-de-sac. Frankly, I think that's where a lot of the left is at these days.
*  It's cutting itself off from more interesting ideas. It's one of the ways that the right has
*  gotten a kind of cultural upward hand on the left by perhaps cynically, but entertaining ideas.
*  And people are, all people, I think, are intellectually hungry. They might not
*  seem intellectually hungry. I'm not saying that they all, everybody wants to read esoteric theory.
*  No, but people have ideas about stuff. People have ideas about reality. I mean, the number of people
*  in this country who are interested in things is enormous. And if the left is just offering a set
*  of just-so stories and prefabricated pat answers, it becomes intellectually boring and people will
*  turn away. So that's another problem with all this stuff, that in shutting down, in policing thought,
*  in policing speech, and policing thought, and turning away from the unclean authors and ideas,
*  the left is painting itself into a corner.
*  You're right that millennials, which I think is true, are kind of shaking off a lot of this woke
*  culture.
*  Yeah. I definitely see that. Probably because it's for them, it's the establishment. It's not edgy.
*  It's the guidance counselors and the principals that are pushing the trans club. Nothing against
*  trans rights. I support all of that. But don't be surprised if there's a backlash when that
*  becomes the official ideology and everyone is supposed to just accept the preconceived
*  arguments of that lobby, essentially.
*  So yeah, you get people who are, you get younger people who are turning away from that,
*  unfortunately, sometimes into some pretty destructive directions, but also I think they're
*  just getting over this stuff. And there was certainly a blossoming of a kind of socialist
*  politics in the last 20 years and a revampification of Marxism. My generation,
*  Gen X scholars, we got hammered by this post-structuralist moment and the anti-communism
*  and anti-Marxism that was central to that stuff. And so you learned, perhaps even without knowing
*  it, that you were not supposed to get too into those ideas. You could sort of assume their
*  existence and utility, but you don't want to dig into that too much. I was explicitly told
*  such things by a British socialist criminologist, Ian Taylor, a great guy who passed away. But he
*  said to me, I think it's important you don't identify as a Marxist. And he had identified
*  as a Marxist for the first half of his career, but he was telling me this in the mid-90s. And he was
*  saying, it's like, because you're not going to get a job if you do that. They're going to
*  red bait you. He didn't say that part, but that was implicit. But the younger folks have thrown
*  that off and we got- Well, but they've been-
*  They've been- Jackman for not being critical in relation to COVID. Jackman is a great example of
*  this, of a kind of young millennial and zoomers who are digging into the fundamental class
*  questions and all of the literatures that have accumulated over the last 150 years that help
*  the class struggle and the politics of class struggle. Well, because this generation's
*  hammered economically. I mean, they have been completely betrayed by the system.
*  Yep. A friend of mine out west who was in DSA when it was blossoming, I asked him, I said,
*  why are all these people into DSA? And he recounted how they were in some meeting and everybody
*  went around and told the story of what happened to their families in the 2008 crash. And a lot of
*  these people, 70% of people in the room were like, yeah, my parents got divorced because
*  we lost the house or it was just like, stories of real suffering among middle-class people.
*  But there was this like economic trauma. I think that's actually the key rupture that helps explain
*  the revival of socialist politics and kind of Marxist thinking. Not that that
*  socialist politics and that Marxist thinking always has everything right. No, not that it's
*  just complete in and of itself. No, but it is absolutely important to focus our intellectual
*  efforts and our political organizing on the core class questions about who produces wealth, how,
*  and for whom, you know, and to think about ourselves in relationship to those material
*  questions because the vast majority of us make our living by selling our labor. And the way life
*  is going to improve is if everybody comes together and struggles for what they all need in common
*  against the few, the increasing few who are hoarding more and more and in the process,
*  in fact, creating bubbles and crashes that damage all of us and even freak out some of those
*  owners of capital. Well, we haven't seen an oligarchy. I mean, you know, figures like Bezos,
*  are they worth $180 billion? I mean, you'd probably have to go back to pharaonic Egypt
*  to find this kind of disparity and then a system that they have distorted to essentially
*  impoverish the rest of us and funnel wealth upwards. And that makes you ask the right questions.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Great. That was Christian Parente, professor at John Jay College, and we were
*  discussing his article, The Cargo Cult of Woke. I want to thank Diego and Sophia, Thomas, and Max,
*  who produced the show. You can find me at chrisedges.substack.com.
