# Israel’s War on the Foreign Press (w Jeremy Loffredo)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQRUpXInXiQ)
*  Jeremy LaFredo, a reporter for the Gray Zone, did some of the best reporting from inside
*  Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on what is happening in Israel
*  since the attacks by Hamas and other resistance groups on October 7, 2023.
*  His reporting saw him detained in Israel on October 8, 2024 at a checkpoint in the West
*  Bank.
*  The allegations against him stemmed from a report, apparently about exposing the locations
*  of strikes launched at missile targets inside Israel by Iran, although other media outlets
*  did the same thing.
*  He was blindfolded, shackled, thrown in a military truck, placed in solitary confinement
*  for three days with little food or water, and eventually unofficially deported.
*  His detention and deportation highlight the cases of Palestinian journalists, over 130
*  of whom have been killed in Gaza, many after being targeted by Israel.
*  Israel has also arrested dozens of Palestinian journalists since October 7.
*  At least 43 Palestinian journalists remain imprisoned by Israel, according to the Committee
*  to Protect Journalists.
*  Many are held under Israel's administrative detention law, which allows for indefinite
*  detention without charge or trial.
*  Even a detainee's location is often unknown.
*  Human rights organizations have reported evidence of Palestinian journalists being tortured
*  in Israeli prisons.
*  Today we are going to look at several of Lofredo's reports for the gray zone, examine the heavy
*  censorship in Israel, the suppression of all speech that raises concerns about the genocide
*  in Gaza by Palestinians and Israelis, the heavy-handed repression against Palestinians
*  that has been turbocharged since October 7 in the West Bank, and how this internal repression
*  is reconfiguring the Israeli state into despotism.
*  Joining me to discuss his reporting and detention is the journalist Jeremy Lofredo.
*  I want to look at several of your reports before we go into detail about your arrest
*  and what happened so people can get a look at the kind of reporting you did.
*  We begin, one of your earliest reports before you even go to Israel and the occupied territories
*  is a story about Zionists at protests in New York City from last year.
*  Just set that up for us and tell us what it is we're going to see.
*  Sure.
*  So this was a few days after October 7.
*  And this wasn't really a protest, this was a counter-protest.
*  So a few days later, Israel was well into launching their attack into Gaza, and there
*  was an anti-war rally, a pro-Palestine rally in New York City outside of the Israeli embassy.
*  And there was these counter-protesters, these counter-Zionist protesters, pro-Israel protesters
*  cheering in opposition to the pro-Palestine people.
*  And instead of covering the Palestinian protesters, which I was very familiar with their language
*  and what they were saying, what they were arguing, free Palestine and the occupation,
*  and then I thought it would be more interesting instead to speak to the other side.
*  And I interviewed them and allowed them to be extremely candid with me.
*  And I interviewed many of them.
*  They called for genocide, they called for a second Nakba.
*  You'll see it right here.
*  Oh, like this, but all this Jewish.
*  Two options.
*  What do you think the response should be to Gaza?
*  We gotta wipe them off the fucking map.
*  I'm talking about every fucking flat, like a parking lot.
*  Yeah, wait.
*  We have flats in the mountains.
*  One simply, get rid of them.
*  There's nothing else you can do.
*  They proved to us that there's nothing else you can do.
*  We tried and...
*  We tried everything.
*  It doesn't work.
*  We have to wipe them flat off the fucking map, like a fucking parking lot.
*  I'm not stopping till all Arabs are wiped out.
*  I think now is the time that we need to erase Gaza.
*  There is people inside, our people inside, that kidnapped.
*  And now we need to kill all of them and free Israel.
*  All of their belief is killing Jewish and killing and murder our people.
*  Flatten it.
*  Flatten Gaza.
*  That will be the last war in Gaza.
*  This will be.
*  Yes.
*  It should be.
*  So, Jeremy, how reflective were those statements to the kinds of statements you heard from
*  Israelis once you got to Israel?
*  Well, when I interviewed those people, I had never been to Israel before.
*  I interviewed them and it was the first time I heard anyone be so candidly racist and genocidal.
*  And I didn't know, truly, I didn't know the face of fanatical Zionism.
*  I didn't know that people spoke like that.
*  So I was surprised.
*  And I was surprised that it wasn't just one person said something crazy.
*  It was a group of 100 people all saying the same thing, all saying things like that.
*  And obviously, you know, this is everyone, when I went to Israel, you know, a few weeks
*  after that, you know, everyone has war fever.
*  There's flags everywhere that weren't there a few weeks before.
*  Together we will win signs, bring them home signs.
*  You know, it's like, you know, post 9-11 almost.
*  It's very like the war propaganda is everywhere.
*  And it was also reflective, like in what people were saying, like even, you know, maybe I
*  was at a pub talking to someone who went to a liberal arts school, likes to paint, you
*  know, everything you hear them say, you know, they're left leaning, they want free health
*  care, they want, you know, affordable housing.
*  And then they speak about the Palestinian question.
*  And then they like, you know, the Arabs are smelly.
*  We need to take over Gaza.
*  And so even the people that I would expect to hear, you know, more progressive language
*  from sounded exactly like, you know, the far-right fanatical Zionists that I interviewed, you
*  know, weeks before in New York City.
*  So it was kind of a shock to me.
*  Yeah, we had the same thing during the war in Yugoslavia.
*  We used to interview Serbs who were artists and well-educated.
*  We called it the Linda Blair effect because as soon as they started talking about Muslims,
*  their heads started to spin around and around and around, like, of course, fanatical Zionists.
*  Let's talk about the West Bank.
*  I was in the West Bank this summer.
*  The genocidal tactics that are commonplace in Gaza are increasingly being used in the
*  West Bank.
*  You have a very good report called On the Silent War in the West Bank.
*  And perhaps you can, because we're not showing the whole clip, just explain what it is we're
*  going to see.
*  Sure.
*  So shortly after October 7th, you know, no journalists are allowed in Gaza.
*  And so I went to the West Bank.
*  I wanted to, you know, be with the Palestinians, you know, after this war began, see what they
*  were dealing with in the occupied West Bank, see what life was like.
*  And after the war began, you know, the hundreds of thousands of settlers in the West Bank
*  who were illegally there, they were all turned in to military reservists, all of them, all
*  of the military-aged ones.
*  So they were giving...
*  To be clear, Jeremy, that's over 700...
*  There are 700,000 colonists in the West Bank.
*  We're talking about a pretty large number.
*  Yeah, a giant number.
*  They were all given, you know, military uniforms.
*  Some settlements were given Humvees.
*  They were given guns, even though they already had guns.
*  They were given guns.
*  And they were kind of given carte blanche to do what they already wanted to do and were
*  already doing, you know, at a very... in a smaller frequency.
*  They wanted to cleanse the Palestinians of the West Bank.
*  They wanted to, you know, get rid of them.
*  They wanted to get rid of villages and then put in paperwork and build more Jewish settlements,
*  more apartment buildings.
*  And so no one was there.
*  No one's there post, you know, post October 7th.
*  The military, the police were not there to, you know, kind of, you know, break up the
*  fighting or like stop the settlers from doing things that are illegal.
*  I mean, their entire existence there is illegal, but from, you know, being extra violent.
*  So the military and the settlers were working together after October 7th to get rid of the
*  Palestinians in the West Bank while all eyes were in Gaza.
*  Yeah, they created rogue militias.
*  It's been the largest land seizure in the West Bank since the Israeli occupation.
*  I think 30% of the Jordan Valley, if I have that right.
*  And they have created reigns of terror by going into these Palestinian villages.
*  And that's... you're in one of these villages.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  The thousands of Palestinians from villages that have already been cleansed and displaced
*  from their rural lands have had to find land away from settlers and pitch tents.
*  Residents of this village were told by settlers accompanied by the Israeli military that if
*  they did not vacate their land in 24 hours, they would all be killed.
*  Entire bedrooms remain.
*  Children's toys.
*  School books.
*  Food.
*  Dressers full of clothing.
*  Before fleeing, the Palestinians spray painted one of their shacks.
*  We will return one day, it says.
*  The settlers have destroyed many of these structures in order to ensure that no one
*  returns before they begin building a new, illegal Jewish development.
*  This Palestinian, along with his children, lived in this village.
*  They are now living on a small plot of land alongside other displaced residents.
*  I spoke to him in a gas station parking lot because he was terrified of what settlers
*  would do if they spotted him being interviewed by a foreign journalist.
*  The Israeli soldiers were attacked on October 12.
*  At noon, we were attacked by a group of Israeli soldiers.
*  The settlers were wearing civilian clothes and the soldiers were wearing military clothes.
*  They were armed.
*  There were about 30 cars, more than 70 soldiers.
*  They were armed.
*  Those who were not armed were armed with knives, knives, and weapons.
*  They attacked us and started beating us.
*  They hit us on the ground and hit us with their weapons.
*  They took our belongings and our phones so that we wouldn't film or record anything.
*  They were beating us on the ground for more than half an hour and they were hitting us with our hands.
*  They tied our hands to the building's handle.
*  They tied our hands to the building's handle.
*  After half an hour of torture, beatings, and fire, they would have been with us for an hour.
*  You would have to take your belongings, the children, women, and go.
*  You're not allowed to take their belongings.
*  They would beat you up in the car, you were not allowed to take anything.
*  Another hour, they said, here I will die, we're going to be shot.
*  Then there was fire on the sheep and on the people.
*  They beat us and beat us.
*  The homeless people went out.
*  We were in war.
*  They were all in their uniforms.
*  It was during the war.
*  They all dressed up as soldiers and ran to the house to be slaughtered,
*  killed and locked up on the road.
*  Instead of going out to get food for our children, food for our mothers.
*  They made a barrier for us.
*  The situation has changed. It's become worse.
*  The slaughter has become easier.
*  I wish I could rest.
*  On the contrary, I am living a very difficult life these days.
*  I have no home, no shelter, no toilet, no food, no water,
*  even my clothes. I have nothing to feed the rain with.
*  I have no food.
*  I can't go back because I'm afraid of my life.
*  I'm afraid of my children, my children, and my family.
*  Another West Bank Palestinian who has been forcefully displaced from his village is Mohammed.
*  Mohammed now lives with his entire extended family in a tent on someone else's property.
*  Imagine if I was in the
*  I also died from the lack of water and food.
*  In Gaza, they cut off water, food and electricity.
*  Here in Rosh Hash, they cut off water and electricity.
*  What should I do?
*  I don't live in Gaza. I live here in Zad Zaffa.
*  They cut off water and electricity.
*  We are left with nothing.
*  My Palestinian brothers and sisters,
*  they are not left with anything.
*  They are all dead.
*  Every Palestinian is a different thing.
*  There is a difficult life in Gaza.
*  This is a cluster, a cluster, a cluster, a cluster.
*  When it exploded.
*  It exploded like a bomb, like a nuclear explosion.
*  The local people here in Zaffa
*  they press on Palestine as they did on Israel and on Gaza.
*  And when Palestine goes here, it explodes like a bomb.
*  The situation is still like this, they press on.
*  The Palestinian people, they are the ones who ate air.
*  The war, the war in Gaza is like this.
*  They left.
*  What is this from the government's terrorism policy?
*  A terrorist policy.
*  A policy of pressure,
*  of shutting down people.
*  There are Arabs and Muslims living in Europe.
*  They come from Syria.
*  They live in Europe.
*  They have problems like they have.
*  Why don't they become a resident?
*  Why don't they become like America or Europe?
*  Why don't they become a resident?
*  You have your rights and everyone has their rights.
*  If there is a resident in Palestine,
*  the citizen,
*  the citizen between the citizen,
*  it won't be like this.
*  Let's talk about
*  Palestinians who are arrested for their activism.
*  You interview a woman who was detained in an Israeli prison,
*  and then she's released as part of the November hostage exchange.
*  So maybe you can talk a little bit about that report.
*  Sure. So this is now, I guess,
*  two years ago,
*  her house was raided,
*  just like her neighbor's house.
*  There have been dozens of times,
*  just like her house has been dozens of times.
*  And they made some vague accusations against her,
*  as they do all Palestinians living in the West Bank,
*  saying that you said something wrong,
*  you talked to someone wrong,
*  you posted something on social media that we didn't like.
*  I don't know exactly what they told her.
*  And they took her away and they put her in prison.
*  And she was in prison under this administrative detention.
*  And so she is not charged.
*  She's a woman.
*  She's not charged.
*  She's in prison for however long the Israelis say.
*  And she can be kept wherever the Israelis say.
*  She's in a prison where her family doesn't know where she is.
*  She has no rights.
*  And this is a woman,
*  probably the age of my mother.
*  And this is outside of Bethlehem in a refugee camp.
*  And after interviewing her,
*  I will say she reached back out to me,
*  explaining that they just came and took her neighbor.
*  This is just like that they took her.
*  So this is not happening to one person.
*  I didn't find the one person who this has happened to.
*  This happens to all Palestinians.
*  They get put into administrative detention for political speech.
*  And this is just one of the women.
*  While over 100 Israelis are being held captive in Gaza,
*  Israel is holding over 10,000 Palestinians in its own jails.
*  More than 3,000 of these Palestinians were arrested and detained without charge,
*  trial, or the ability to appeal.
*  The state of Israel calls this type of trial a criminal act.
*  And it's not just a criminal act.
*  It's a criminal act that is not just a criminal act.
*  It's a criminal act that is not just a criminal act.
*  The state of Israel calls this type of procedure administrative detention.
*  It's reserved for Palestinians who engage in any type of political activity
*  or speech against Israeli occupation and their family members.
*  What it amounts to is official kidnapping.
*  Radu Abba-Ajamia is a 47-year-old Palestinian woman
*  who's lived her entire life in the Deheisha refugee camp
*  outside Bethlehem in the West Bank.
*  She was taken from her home by military police last year
*  and kept in one of the Israeli prisons.
*  In November, Hamas used 50 Israelis.
*  They took prisoner on October 7 as political leverage
*  to free 150 Palestinians from Israeli jails.
*  Rauda is one of the Palestinian prisoners who was released.
*  She served seven months in Ofer prison and Damone prison.
*  I traveled through dozens of military checkpoints
*  in order to sit down with Rauda in her living room
*  as she recounted her arrest, Israeli prison, and coming home.
*  I was in the middle of the room.
*  Most of the doors were blown up.
*  I had a window in my room.
*  After about ten minutes,
*  they took me to my sister.
*  We moved because they were hitting the sound barrier.
*  They didn't want to hurt my soldiers.
*  They didn't have a refrigerator.
*  They had a refrigerator.
*  They were supposed to put the dogs in it
*  or the dogs' eyes.
*  The military camp was located almost below the house.
*  A soldier hit me and put his finger in my eye.
*  We went to Asyon.
*  From Asyon to another camp called Banorama.
*  It was the first time I heard about it.
*  They took me to Ofer.
*  I stayed there for about four months.
*  Without any hearing, without any trial,
*  and no ability to appeal, Rauda was sent to prison.
*  They also arrested her teenage nephew.
*  Let's move on to the Israeli settlers.
*  Can I just say one thing about that video real quick?
*  Yeah.
*  Just how I found that woman.
*  We had this given to us by Ademir,
*  which is a prisoner rights NGO in Ramallah.
*  It was a list of 50 people
*  who were recently released from administrative detention.
*  Out of the 50 people, only one, that woman,
*  she's so courageous, only one was willing to speak to us.
*  Everyone was so afraid that if they spoke to a journalist,
*  they would get thrown right back in prison.
*  That's how arbitrary, that's how strict,
*  that's how much of a coward people are.
*  Out of 50 people, almost everyone is too scared
*  to just speak about their experience to a journalist, except her.
*  Well, and they're told when they're released not to speak out.
*  Yeah, truly.
*  It makes it even more brave.
*  You go down to one of the crossings
*  as a great report.
*  You spend time with the Israeli settlers.
*  Who are, with the collaboration of the army, of course,
*  and the police,
*  blocking the aid trucks coming from Egypt into Gaza.
*  So talk about this first,
*  and then we'll watch the clip from that report.
*  Sure.
*  So I was there.
*  I was in Jerusalem at the time, and I knew this was happening.
*  I didn't really know how exactly to
*  ingratiate myself or kind of embed myself with these people.
*  I at first drove down to these aid blocks,
*  these direct action aid blocks,
*  with a fellow journalist,
*  an anti-Zionist, leftist journalist
*  inside of Israel.
*  We walked around, I was interviewing people,
*  and I noticed that this person was almost
*  getting a little too emotional.
*  This person was kind of arguing with the settlers,
*  and like, you're not going to change these people's minds,
*  arguing about how many women and children are in Gaza, etc.
*  And they were looking at me as if to say,
*  we're not going to speak to these people.
*  So I changed my strategy, and instead
*  I began taking a bus that left from Jerusalem with them
*  through the occupied West Bank. It would stop at settlements,
*  pick up fathers and young children and mothers,
*  and go through the West Bank all the way down south to the Krim Shalom,
*  or then it's on a border crossing. So they would take these buses
*  through the West Bank, pick up the protesters,
*  and bring them to the crossing. And once they would get to the crossing...
*  I mean, this is a closed military zone,
*  so no one is allowed here, supposed to be allowed here.
*  But as soon as these
*  settlers show up, the military
*  uses their presence as justification
*  to shut down the aid crossing.
*  So the military knows, the state of Israel knows,
*  that if they actually shut down the aid crossing,
*  there will be international political outcry.
*  So the settlers do it instead, and they
*  use the settlers to justify shutting down
*  aid to Gaza. So they work hand in hand,
*  the settlers kind of rid the Israeli government
*  of actual political responsibility for not allowing aid into Gaza.
*  And they were sharing sandwiches,
*  the army... And listen, they're not supposed to,
*  it's illegal that they're there, but the military is giving them sandwiches,
*  watermelon, ice pops,
*  they're palling around, they're hanging out,
*  and day after day, as soon as the settlers show up,
*  and I'm with them, the blocking gets closed,
*  no aid gets into Gaza, day after day after day.
*  And they consider that a giant, giant success.
*  And after I filed this report, I was told,
*  oh, these are fanatics,
*  this isn't really the government line, these people are fringe,
*  even though the military is working with them,
*  you can see that it's the government line.
*  But now you have people in the Knesset,
*  people in the Likud party, arguing that they should stop aid,
*  that they shouldn't send aid,
*  something that just a few months ago we were told is fringe, and no one was saying that.
*  So it very quickly became reality.
*  And so that's a good intro, we could watch the video.
*  The police, the head commander,
*  came to us and said, okay, you guys came and blocked,
*  we don't want to fight.
*  And he said to us, I'll just lock the gate, you guys don't need to stand in the sun.
*  We got lollipops, we got watermelon from the police.
*  The police gave you lollipops and watermelon?
*  Yeah, watermelon, and it was great, it was great with them.
*  So no food, no nothing?
*  No, they don't deserve it. What I care? Kill them, I don't care.
*  Do you trust Palestinians?
*  No, I know all about them, I don't trust them, I want them out of here.
*  What do you think should happen to Gaza?
*  I think that we should be civilized with Jews from Israel.
*  My unit was in charge of explosions.
*  We blew up houses of terrorists, mosques, UN offices.
*  I remember we got into some UN office that was in charge of helping families in Gaza
*  that was affected by the war and we destroyed it.
*  I remember the first time I was in the building,
*  I was in the building and I was like, what is this?
*  And I was like, what is this?
*  And I was like, what is this?
*  And I was like, what is this?
*  We give pastries for the people, for the soldiers,
*  for the cops, for everybody.
*  This is what we give to our people.
*  This is really humanitarian, okay.
*  They need to block the aid to Gaza,
*  they need to block the gas to Gaza,
*  everything to block.
*  And this is what we do, every week, two, three, four times a week.
*  And as the Bible says, this place is for us, it's promised for us, so they can starve
*  to death to pay on the things that they've done to us on the 7th of October.
*  I think that we need to be more specific.
*  We need to be more specific and we need to return to Gaza and to control the state.
*  To control our own state.
*  Bibi is a puppet of Biden.
*  Because we cleaned all Gaza except for Vafik.
*  Why aren't we going in there?
*  Because Biden asked us not to.
*  That's the only reason.
*  There's no reason not to.
*  For Israel's sake A外
*  for Israel's sake
*  uncles and aunts
*  and
*  They'll live on forever
*  Alright,
*  That last segment, Jeremy, we actually see settlers walking on into, towards Gaza.
*  Yeah, they went into Gaza.
*  These are the same people that were blocking the aid.
*  Sometimes they would go to the northern part of the Gaza Strip, the Eris crossing, and
*  they would have a caravan of people and they would get as close as they could to the Eris
*  border crossing.
*  And they would bring vinyl and plywood and drills and hammers.
*  And the military would allow them into Gaza.
*  Again, this is a closed military zone.
*  There's not supposed to be any civilians here, let alone civilians crossing into Gaza.
*  And they were building what they called symbolic outposts.
*  And these are little sheds or houses that they would build on the Gaza side of the Eris
*  border crossing in a way to tell the government, we are ready to move to Gaza when you tell
*  us that we're allowed to.
*  And a lot of them are from Gush Katif, the last settlement that was in Gaza before the
*  disengagement.
*  And they're calling for the resettlement and the Judaization of Gaza.
*  And they say settlements equal security.
*  So if they believe if they were to settle in Gaza, then the military would have to protect
*  them.
*  And that means the military would be permanently occupying Gaza.
*  And a permanent occupation of Gaza would lead to no more October 7th, as they would argue.
*  If you speak out, even if you're Israeli, of course, against the genocide in Gaza, you
*  are targeted.
*  You have a report speaking to Israelis protesting the war.
*  We're going to see just three clips from it.
*  I'll let you set it up.
*  One is from a Yom Kippur veteran.
*  One is from a high school teacher, a mayor, Baruchin, and the other is from the principal
*  of a school, Yael Ailan.
*  Just explain that report, and then we'll watch those clips.
*  So shortly after October 7th, there is a high school teacher named Mayor Baruchin.
*  And he would post things on Facebook to the effect of, Mohammed was 13 years old.
*  Mohammed wanted to be a professional soccer player, but Mohammed will never be a professional
*  soccer player because he was killed by our wonderful men and women in the Gaza Strip.
*  He was trying to humanize children in Gaza through these Facebook posts.
*  His house was raided.
*  His computers and his cell phones were seized.
*  He was put in solitary confinement for eight or nine days.
*  They tried to charge him with incitement, which carries 25 years to 50 years in prison.
*  Eventually, he was let out of prison, but I was there when he was originally getting
*  arrested.
*  At the courthouse, there was maybe a 10 or 15-person older Israeli Jews there showing
*  their support for this mayor Baruchin.
*  They were brutally beaten by a special police force inside of Jerusalem.
*  So the first interview that we're going to see right now is one of the older men who
*  was there voicing his support for Mayor Baruchin, who was getting charged with incitement for
*  simple Facebook posts, and he was beaten by the police.
*  To say it in one sentence, they came in order to beat us.
*  I didn't see such cruelty, such violence from the side of a Jerusalem police in terms
*  of chasing, eating, not hesitating to beat adults, I would say even old ladies.
*  And people were cursed.
*  I mean, the policemen didn't hesitate to curse people in sentences like, go to Gaza,
*  go to East Jerusalem, go to Sheikh Jarrah, we don't want you, you are lousy leftists.
*  This kind of stuff.
*  We didn't hesitate as people of the law to curse citizens, and we did nothing.
*  For me, it was a fascist event, really.
*  Coming and doing these horrible things to people who respect the law, who did nothing.
*  I was attacked in Jerusalem, and my son, Nadav, serves in the army very near the northern
*  border.
*  I mean, to treat me as a Yom Kippur war veteran and first Lebanese war veteran, as a traitor,
*  as a person whom you have to attack, whom you have to curse or mock, is impossible.
*  By shouting or saying different things that are not in the national consensus, you reveal
*  yourself as a traitor.
*  And we should be clear that that older man that you interviewed, he is a veteran from
*  the Yom Kippur war and his son is in the military.
*  He is not an anti-Zionist by any means.
*  He lives in Israel, he is Jewish, he served in the army, his son is in the army.
*  He just didn't believe that this high school teacher, Mer Baruchin, should be in prison
*  for 50 years for trying to humanize Gazan children on his Facebook.
*  That's the level where they are at in terms of repressing freedom of speech inside of
*  Israeli Jews, not even Palestinians.
*  So this last clip we're going to look at is probably the one that got you in really serious
*  trouble.
*  And this is your reporting on the Iranian airstrikes in Israel.
*  Although I want to, before we talk about it, be clear that you weren't the only one who
*  showed footage from strikes.
*  They came very close to hitting the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, but you weren't
*  the only one who did it.
*  But of course they went after you and I think, you know, having shown clips from all of these
*  reports we can understand why.
*  So talk about this last report and then after that we're going to talk about what happened
*  to you.
*  Sure.
*  So my original plan was to go to the northern West Bank on this most recent trip to spend
*  time in the refugee camps in Jenin, around Nablus, Tolcarum, where there's been regular
*  raids and seizures and they shut off the water.
*  It's one of the few places in the West Bank where there is resistance.
*  And so these people don't want them entering the refugee camp.
*  The Palestinians don't want the military to come in.
*  And so I wanted to go there and document the destruction caused by these raids and speak
*  to people who have to deal with these raids.
*  And for the first time in a long time there's been a handful of airstrikes in the northern
*  West Bank.
*  You know, people are saying it's another front opening up in this war.
*  So that was my plan.
*  But the day I got to Israel, it was October 1st and that was the day of the Iranian ballistic
*  missile retaliatory attack.
*  I spoke to my editor and friend, Max Blumenthal.
*  He said, you know, you are there.
*  Maybe you should file a report about this missile strike.
*  I thought, you know, I don't really know what to say about it.
*  Everyone's talking about it.
*  How about if I just try to find where the missiles landed?
*  Maybe that could be the report.
*  I do that.
*  I go to the Neva Team airbase in the south.
*  I don't really see much.
*  I go to the Mossad headquarters around there.
*  There's a filled in crater.
*  I document it.
*  I look at the news and because I'm only one person, I'm not a news crew, my turnaround
*  was a few days.
*  So my report came out after the mainstream media.
*  PBS NewsHour, Yanet, mainstream Israeli media and American media situated inside of Israel
*  published very similar information that I did.
*  And only I was, you know, acted on and arrested.
*  So we could watch a part of that video and talk about it.
*  Great.
*  I'm Jeremy Lofredo for The Grey Zone in Israel, where last night Iran fired over 200 ballistic
*  missiles in retaliation for the assassinations of Lebanese and Iranian political and military
*  leadership.
*  Since the missile strikes, Israeli authorities have attempted to downplay the significance
*  of the attacks, censor the locations of missile impacts from media publication and claim that
*  Iran was targeting Israeli civilians.
*  What I saw today here in Israel is clear evidence that Iran was targeting the same Israeli intelligence
*  and military infrastructure that's been used over the past year to carry out brutal assassinations
*  and attacks.
*  The military took away most of the missile, but there was still a piece left.
*  The missile fell a quarter mile west of Nevatim Air Base and about a quarter mile from the
*  Bedouin village, which is unrecognized by Israel, so it isn't supplied with any type
*  of state-of-the-art bomb shelters like Jewish communities.
*  Where were people in the communities around here hiding yesterday during the sounds?
*  People were being forced to go to schools wherever there was a shelter or to go to the
*  school.
*  They would be under the bridge.
*  Of course, because there were no shelters and no safe places for people.
*  They would come and hide here, in the rockets.
*  Many people sheltered here last night with the sounds of the rockets.
*  They came and hide here.
*  Using visual clues from footage circulating online, I set out to locate where the missile
*  may have landed.
*  Driving down a street I believed to be in one of the missile videos, I saw a heavily
*  damaged SUV.
*  Its windshield shattered, debris and concrete caked into the vehicle.
*  Further down, the scene unfolded.
*  Destroyed vehicles, torn up asphalt and a massive crater, roughly 30 feet wide, recently
*  filled in with dirt.
*  That's the Mossad headquarters.
*  The missile had hit less than 1,000 feet from Mossad headquarters.
*  This information is missing from all Israeli media reports due to the fact it's been
*  officially censored.
*  Right here are the censored coordinates.
*  Given the proximity to what is considered one of the world's most advanced intelligence
*  agencies, it seemed clear that Israel was taking extra precautions to conceal the exact
*  impact location.
*  As we left the area, an unsettling incident occurred.
*  Our cell phones lost GPS functionality.
*  Maps went blank.
*  And then both devices, mine and my taxi drivers, suddenly showed we were at Amman's airport
*  in Jordan, over 120 miles west.
*  So now, explain what happened.
*  I think you were at a checkpoint.
*  Were you in Calandia in Ramallah?
*  But explain what happened.
*  I was finally, it was the first day where I finally was getting to do what I went there
*  to do, which was reporting the Northern West Bank.
*  I was at a checkpoint, maybe 15 minutes outside of Nablus.
*  And the military asked everyone in the car with me, there was five of us, to hand over
*  our passports, which isn't super strange, asking for ID at a checkpoint.
*  Hundreds of checkpoints in the West Bank.
*  I wasn't nervous at all.
*  I gave the passport to him.
*  And then they came back and they asked for us all to hand over our cell phones.
*  And my phone was locked.
*  And I knew all the information on my phone.
*  Maybe I was communicating with people who were in the Northern West Bank who maybe knew
*  people who would be considered by them as resistance fighters, as the military, as terrorists.
*  But it's valid journalistic inquiry for me to be communicating with these people for interviews.
*  So yeah, I handed over my cell phone.
*  Everyone did except one journalist.
*  He refused to.
*  And he had a gun pointed at his face.
*  He was dragged out of the car.
*  He was punched a few times.
*  And then they took his phone as well and then told all of us to get out of the car and stand on the street,
*  sit on the street beside the military checkpoint.
*  And then maybe after an hour of us sitting on the dirt, one of the Army officers pointed at me and said,
*  Mr. Lofredo, will you come here?
*  So I crossed the street towards the checkpoint and I said, what's happening?
*  And they said, you're being arrested.
*  And they pulled out maybe 20 or 30 feet of blindfold cloth.
*  And they wrapped it tightly around my head, you know, maybe 10 or 15 times around my ears, my eyes and part of my nose.
*  They shackled my legs and they zip tied my hands.
*  And then I was put in a military Humvee and kind of arbitrarily driven around.
*  And then it stopped.
*  I was then transferred into a police car or what seemed to be a police car.
*  I was blindfolded still.
*  And then the police car drove about an hour south towards towards Jerusalem.
*  It took me to the biggest police headquarters in the West Bank and I was put in a holding cell.
*  My blindfold was finally taken off my head.
*  I was in the holding cell and they actually they arrested all of us who were in the car.
*  So we were all here at this kind of West Bank military compound.
*  The other journalists that I was with were were allowed to go home.
*  And that's kind of when I thought to myself maybe maybe this is this is something more serious for me because everyone's allowed to go home except except me.
*  And I heard them playing this report.
*  My voice, I heard my own voice when I was sitting in my holding cell.
*  I heard them listening to my report.
*  So I knew it was something not that I was at a checkpoint, not that I was with maybe some people that I was with have Israeli citizenship and they're not allowed into Nablus.
*  But it was not about any of that.
*  It was about my video report before I was able to speak to a lawyer or anything like that.
*  They called me out of my cell and they told me to stand in front of of a big flag that said together we will win, which is like the nationalist wartime slogan for the war.
*  And it wasn't they didn't take like official photos.
*  They all took out their phones.
*  They were yelling at me in Hebrew.
*  They were snapping photos for like maybe they have a group chat or something just kind of taunting me.
*  I'm telling me to stand here telling me to smile telling me to stop smiling.
*  And then they would send me back to my holding cell.
*  They're really just trying to confuse me and scare me.
*  And then finally after a few hours in the holding cell, they said your your lawyers on the phone.
*  I said I don't know why I even need a lawyer like what I still don't really know what's happening.
*  I answered the phone and the lawyer says Mr. Lufredo, I want you to think very hard.
*  What have you done?
*  You're being charged with giving information to the enemy during wartime.
*  It's a very grave offense.
*  And do you can you think of anything?
*  I said I filed a report and I am trying to speak to this woman and she barely speaks any English and I have like 45 seconds to speak to my lawyer.
*  So she doesn't really understand what I'm saying.
*  I don't really understand what she's saying.
*  The phone call and she says, listen, they're going to interrogate you.
*  You're going to be brought to a prison and I'll see you in court tomorrow.
*  And so that's that was the first day.
*  And that's how I originally got arrested.
*  And then what happened?
*  First, I was interrogated.
*  They asked me if I was familiar with Israel's military censor.
*  I said yes.
*  And they said, then why did you publish your video, et cetera, et cetera?
*  I said I published my video.
*  I'm familiar with your censor, of course, but because your entire mainstream media was publishing information similar to mine, I didn't know I was breaking any censorship laws.
*  They asked me if I have any connections or friends or family in foreign militaries.
*  I said no.
*  They asked me why I included the coordinates in the video.
*  I said because, you know, as a journalist, you know, giving as much information context is important.
*  And, you know, many journalists would say the same thing.
*  And this entire interrogation, it was in Hebrew.
*  There was only it was only translated from a person on a cell phone who spoke Russian, very little English.
*  So I'm trying to tell this person on the cell phone why I think what I did is right and why I'm innocent.
*  And she doesn't really understand me and she's trying to tell the Hebrew guy who also doesn't understand me like it's we are all upset.
*  I'm getting frustrated and I'm scared.
*  The intelligence officer doesn't understand what I'm saying and is upset with a person on the phone who's supposed to be translating.
*  So it's a horrible way to hold an interrogation, to communicate with someone.
*  And then I'm putting an unmarked police vehicle and I'm taken to the Russian compound in Jerusalem, which is about a 15 minute drive west.
*  And so I get to the military.
*  I get to the Russian compound.
*  They open a solitary confinement cell.
*  It's about 10 feet by eight feet.
*  There's a concrete slab with a bed or blanket, depending on how you want to use it.
*  It's so thin it could be used as both.
*  And I get put in there.
*  They slam the door shut.
*  I don't know at that point what time my court hearing is the next day.
*  I'm just kind of in solitary confinement now.
*  And, you know, eight hours before I was in a car driving to meet someone in Abloos and do my job.
*  And now I'm being charged with, you know, as an enemy of the state.
*  And so I had my first night in prison and then the next morning.
*  And keep in mind, at this point, they did not give me any water or any food.
*  I had my court appearance and the intelligence, the prosecutors, they wanted to keep me in solitary confinement for seven days.
*  And the judge said, why seven days?
*  And they said, because he's dangerous.
*  And they said, why do you think he's dangerous?
*  And they said, it's top secret.
*  And I and this is all being translated to me.
*  Entire entire court hearing is in Hebrew.
*  I don't understand what's happening.
*  And the judge doesn't believe them really when they say it's top secret, thankfully.
*  And she says, you can have him for one day.
*  You can interrogate him for one day.
*  You can interrogate him.
*  You can go through his cell phone.
*  You can go through his computer.
*  You have one day to to continue on this on this with these charges.
*  And so they bring me back to solitary confinement.
*  They don't feed me that night either.
*  And they also don't interrogate me.
*  The police don't interrogate me, even though the judge told them that they were allowed to.
*  And so the next day in court, a UNET journalist came and testified on my behalf and said, I am I'm a journalist.
*  I have a GPO card.
*  I have a government press office card.
*  I am mandated to go through the military censor whenever I publish something.
*  And I published something very similar to Mr.
*  Lofredo. And not only that, I published information relating to why Jeremy Lofredo was detained.
*  And the military censor allowed me to explain what was in his video and even allowed me to embed his video in my article.
*  And they said there's nothing secret in it.
*  And so he showed his conversation with the military censor to the judge.
*  The judge read all of it and said, OK, if Mr.
*  Lofredo can publish this and I mean, if the UNET journalists can publish this, why can't Mr.
*  Lofredo? And the police said, well, it's because Mr.
*  Lofredo doesn't like Israel.
*  And so that's that's like it's not even an opinion.
*  It's like this was very political and this had very little to do with that actual video.
*  This had much more to do with my prior reporting and maybe with the Grey Zone publishes and what I've published in the past in Israel in the West Bank.
*  But thankfully, like that is the opinion and that is the view.
*  And that is how the police and the military conduct themselves.
*  But this judge didn't really accept that and said he needs to be let out of detention.
*  I was brought out of the prison.
*  I was brought back to the court, brought back to prison.
*  I was signing the paperwork to leave prison and a few guards said something in Hebrew to me and they grabbed me.
*  They pulled me away from the paper.
*  They took the pen out of my hands and they threw me back in solitary confinement.
*  I did not know what was happening.
*  They didn't tell me anything.
*  And a few hours later, this is probably 8 p.m.
*  Intelligence officers, plain clothes, come to my cell and take me out.
*  They shackle me.
*  They handcuff me.
*  They load me into a car and they take me back into the West Bank.
*  And I'm frightened.
*  I'm wondering if I'm going to get tortured now.
*  I really don't know what's happening.
*  The people driving the car aren't really telling me anything, the police officers.
*  And I just asked them what's happening.
*  And they said interrogation.
*  I said, but I was just about to leave prison.
*  What happened?
*  And the court allowed the police to appeal the court's decision hours after the window for appealing.
*  The decision had closed already.
*  They were allowed to retroactively appeal it and throw me back in prison and take me to the West Bank.
*  And so I was interrogated at night in the West Bank at this military compound.
*  And they asked me.
*  Now I know they have my phone.
*  So I'm wondering if they can ask me now about what's on my cell phone.
*  If you have someone's cell phone, you're kind of in their brain.
*  These are now different questions than just why or why not is your video legal or illegal.
*  But thankfully, all the questions still pertained to my video.
*  And then they brought me back to the prison.
*  And so at that point, I was kind of getting a little I was thinking a little more positively about the situation that they really don't have anything.
*  They're trying to charge me as an enemy of the state, you know, as a spy.
*  But like they just keep going back to this video and I keep answering why I think this video is legal.
*  Other people were reporting on it.
*  And, you know, like I'm saying it very confidently.
*  And they say, you know, if if everyone committed murder, does that mean you could commit murder?
*  Like saying, making the analogy that everybody had reported on it.
*  That means can I report on it?
*  You know, they they know they know very well that everyone else is reporting on it.
*  So like they're making it clear in court transcripts to my face in secret.
*  They know that I already report on it.
*  I get brought back to prison.
*  Still have not gotten any food or water.
*  I spend the night in that morning.
*  They finally give me a cup of chocolate pudding and someone comes to my cell and they introduce themselves as a as like a social worker doing a wellness check on me.
*  Sent sent to my cell because the American Embassy told the prison to send me a social worker.
*  I said, this is great. Maybe I'll get more food.
*  Maybe I'll get some water. Maybe I'm going to get some help.
*  And she said, why did you hurt Israel?
*  You know, you hurt Israel. Do you love Israel?
*  And I was, you know, taking it back. I thought I was about to get some help.
*  She's berating me for my for my reporting.
*  She's berating me because I don't agree with her when it comes to the occupation.
*  And she tells me that I'm probably going to spend a long time in prison.
*  And then she closes the steel window to my solitary confinement cell.
*  She walks away. So just to clarify, like that is the only help that the American Embassy afforded me was giving me this, you know, Zionist social worker to berate me because of my reporting and give me no help at all.
*  But that's beside the point. I went to court a few hours later and finally I was allowed out.
*  And I had to spend the next 10 days in the country without my passport, my phone or my laptop and allow the authorities to continue to continue interrogating me.
*  And while you were in the prison, I believe you heard screams or cries from Palestinians. Is that correct?
*  Yeah, I was I was in solitary confinement. But, you know, maybe there was 100, 150 other prisoners in there, all Palestinian.
*  I was the only white person from what I can tell. I didn't see any Israelis.
*  But I can't see anything for myself, but I can hear everything.
*  And I heard, you know, like really, really, you know, harsh like crying and yelling only to be interrupted by, you know, quick demands and questions in Hebrew from I would assume obviously is a guard or police officer.
*  Crying and yelling for maybe four hours straight. And like I'm hearing this and sitting in my cell and it's no it's it's for lack of a better word, it's tortures just to hear that.
*  And I can't, you know, obviously, I can't imagine what these people are going through.
*  I mean, this is there's torture happening in this prison.
*  And this is a prison that is notorious for they bring Palestinians to this prison and they torture them in order to like manufacture false confessions.
*  And this prison is also like notably criticized by human rights groups because it's not in the West Bank.
*  It's not in Palestine. So they're bringing Palestinians from the West Bank into, you know, Israel and interrogating them there.
*  So that's where they brought me. So that's where they bring an American journalist.
*  They're not treating me as an American. They're not treating me as a journalist. They're treating me as an enemy of the state.
*  And clearly for them, there's no difference.
*  And you're allowed to leave your your lawyer calls it an informal deportation and they've left your case open, which essentially means if you can't go back because if your case is open, they can grab you again.
*  Is that correct?
*  Yes, my lawyer, my lawyer called it. So I'll just back up. I'll tell you exactly what happened.
*  So I was interrogated for probably a combined time of 15 hours during that 10 days.
*  One interrogation was six hours long.
*  And then other interrogations were, you know, an hour or two hours where they're just continuously asking me the same questions different ways, you know, trying to see if I if I'm lying or if I slip up on an answer, just like playing semantics.
*  And one interesting question they asked me was, you know, they said, you expect me to believe that you went to school for journalism.
*  You went to school for journalism. You took all these classes. You had all these professors.
*  But you never learned about the importance of a military censor.
*  I said, you know, I explained that we have the First Amendment and that's not exactly how it works in America.
*  And I would assume he understands this.
*  And he was as if he was, you know, learning about America for me.
*  You know, he couldn't wrap his head around, you know, the military not censoring journalists.
*  And as of course, that happens here. But, you know, there's it's much more, you know, self-censorship.
*  But that was one question they asked me.
*  And, you know, they're asking me about other other reports that I've seen that I knew had happened in Israel that had the same information as me.
*  So I had to tell them these reports.
*  And I was kept in these these interrogations for hours and hours and hours, you know, without water, still shackled, still handcuffed.
*  And then finally, after 10 days, the 20th of October came and that was the day that the court said, I find out if I'm getting re-arrested or if I get my passport, my phone and my laptop back.
*  And they called my lawyer and they said, can Mr. Lofredo book a sooner flight?
*  Because my flight was for the 23rd, you know, two days later.
*  And she said, she said, of course. So I went to my lawyer's office. I used their computers. I booked a flight.
*  We sent them the flight information and they went entirely like entirely in communicato.
*  They had not answered us since. So we booked the flight and we thought, you know, they told us to book a flight.
*  Maybe we should try to get my passport, my phone and my laptop back.
*  So we gave one of my friends there in Jerusalem, you know, power of attorney, sent him to the West Bank Military Compound and they gave him all my stuff back, including my passport.
*  And that was like the final, that was the moment where I found out that like I think I am able to leave.
*  And I got on a plane and they interrogated me at the airport a couple of times, but I did leave the country and they left my case open.
*  Still like I have a case open there right now. I spoke to my lawyer yesterday giving information to the enemy during wartime.
*  It's open. And they, but they allowed me to leave.
*  And if I come back back through Ben Gurion Airport, you know, the most securitized airport probably in the world and I will be immediately detained.
*  My lawyer says for the same charges that they were trying to get me on before.
*  So I'm dissuaded from going back until the case is closed. I don't know if I really ever want to go back.
*  Great. Thank you. That was journalist Jeremy Lofredo.
*  I want to thank Max, Diego, Sophia and Thomas who produced the show.
*  You can find me at chrisedges.substack.com.
*  Thank you.
