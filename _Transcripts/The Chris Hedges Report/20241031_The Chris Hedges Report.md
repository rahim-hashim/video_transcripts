# Do Not Vote for those Who Support Genocide  (w Kshama Sawant)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQRp56P8lbg)
*  Former Seattle City Councilmember Shama Sawant, while campaigning in Dearborn, Michigan for
*  the Green Party presidential campaign of Jill Stein and her National Labor Movement worker
*  strike back, said, quote, We need to be clear about what our goals are. We are not in a
*  position to win the White House. But we do have a real opportunity to win something historic.
*  We could deny Kamala Harris the state of Michigan.
*  And the polls show that most likely Harris cannot win the election without Michigan.
*  Her remarks earned her the ire of liberals and some on the left who accuse her of being a
*  stalking horse for Donald Trump. But she argues that unless the Democratic Party is made to pay
*  a price for its support for the genocide in Gaza, it will never reform itself. And this
*  genocide and future genocides will not be stopped. Kamala Harris needs the blue wall
*  states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to win the election. She is in a statistical
*  dead heat with Trump in these three states. But it increasingly appears that she is in
*  serious trouble in Michigan, home to some 200,000 Arab Americans. Dearborn residents
*  regularly attend funerals for loved ones or friends killed in Gaza, the West Bank,
*  and now Lebanon. The anger about the scale of death and destruction in Gaza has been
*  stoked of course by Israel's bombing campaign of Beirut and southern Lebanon, increased
*  attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, including land seizures, and the refusal by
*  Harris and the Democratic Party to use its leverage to halt Israel's mass slaughter.
*  Joining me to discuss the election and our call to walk away from the Democrats and Harris,
*  even if it means the election of Trump, is Shama Salwan. Let's begin with what you said.
*  I'm going to be completely upfront. I'm in total agreement with you. Let's begin with
*  what you said and why you said it. As you said, we said in our meeting rally in Michigan,
*  in Dearborn, that was a rally jointly organized by a worker strike back alongside with Abandon
*  Harris and the Jill Stein campaign. And our starting point was, and you allude you to this,
*  Chris, is no votes for genocide. That if genocide is not a red line, then there is no red line.
*  And that is why we need to turn out every possible vote for Jill Stein, who is the strongest left
*  anti-war pro worker candidate, and especially where they matter the most, which is in swing
*  states like Michigan, which could actually decide the outcome of the election. And in fact,
*  we are joined by the activists at Abandon Harris, who have also said that this needs to,
*  the Democrats' role in the genocide has to mean that they have to pay a price for what they have
*  done and what they continue to do. And for us, we don't believe that the Democratic party by itself
*  is going to reform itself simply because of a message that is sent by the Muslim voters and by
*  the anti-war movement, if that indeed happens. And I think we should be clear, it's not a
*  straightforward thing. In fact, we have to work really hard to turn out the vote for Jill Stein
*  in states like Michigan and workers strike by activists are right now on the ground to do that.
*  But the purpose of doing this, first of all, is as we said, it's a moral and political question.
*  If genocide is not a red line, then there is no red line. And beyond that, it is to illustrate
*  that at the end of the day, neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump, neither the Democratic party nor
*  the Republican party has any interest whatsoever in stopping the genocide, let alone stopping wars
*  in a general sense. They have no interest in fulfilling the needs of hundreds of millions of
*  American working people. And so we, for us, for the anti-war movement, for the American working class,
*  for us, the only way forward is independent of the Democratic and Republican parties. And we see
*  this, this meaning the fight to defeat Harris in Michigan and potentially for her to, for her to,
*  you know, for her, for it to defeat Harris in the election as a whole, for us to win every possible
*  vote for Jill Stein. All of this is a stepping stone to build a powerful anti-war movement that
*  is independent of the big business, warmongering parties of US capitalism and also pointing towards
*  the dire urgent need for a new anti-war party for the working class.
*  We should be clear, and this was of course the fallacy of Bernie Sanders campaign, you're not
*  going to build a movement like this in an election cycle. Yes, exactly. And in fact, that has been
*  one of the abiding flaws of the approach that has been used by many left candidates over and
*  over again. Obviously Bernie Sanders is top most among them. And in fact, it's important to examine
*  how far Bernie Sanders has gone, not to mention AOC and the squad. I don't necessarily put them
*  in the same category as Bernie Sanders, but Bernie Sanders is a very useful education of what not to
*  do where even despite good intentions, and I don't doubt his good intentions, despite that,
*  if your political analysis tells you that the best we can do, the best that working people and
*  anti-war activists can do is to get behind Biden and then after that get behind Harris, then that
*  is a dead end. And at that point, good intentions don't matter. If you are leading the working class
*  and movements, both working class movements and the anti-war movement down this dead end of
*  supporting the very party that represents the interests of the same billionaire class that is
*  completely antagonistic to the interests of working people and the same billionaire class
*  that has an interest in this genocide, and they're not innocent bystanders, they are
*  driving this process. They are also not just tolerating Netanyahu's extreme practices,
*  but really not wanting it. No, I mean, that is all political theater. The purpose of that is to
*  create a grand illusion that somehow the Biden-Harris administration is reluctantly supporting the
*  Israeli state. That is absolutely not the case. In fact, the whole history of American capitalism
*  and capitalism as a whole shows it, proves it to be a consistently bloody and bloodthirsty
*  system in which the blood that flows is that of course not of the billionaire class,
*  it's of working people and poor people. And if we tie ourselves to such, to the political
*  representatives of this system, then we are going to go down the same dead end that Bernie Sanders
*  has gone. And I think we also need to mention the role of the labor leaders. After the Dearborn
*  rally, we also did a rally in Seattle alongside the Jill Stein campaign and Abandon Harris.
*  This was on Tuesday, October 15th. And at that rally, when I spoke, I said that actually
*  the labor leaders who are cheerleading Kamala Harris after having cheerlead Joe Biden,
*  they will have a lot to answer for in history. That history is going to take note of the fact
*  that while 350,000 Palestinian people, babies, children, elderly women were being massacred
*  indiscriminately at that moment, and with the Democrats and with Kamala Harris herself with
*  blood on her hands, at that moment for progressive labor leaders like Sean Fain to be cheerleading
*  Harris, this will be taken note of. And future generations are going to ask at that moment when
*  hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were being slaughtered, what was your position at that time?
*  And you cheerlead the very purveyors of that genocide. And in my speech, I urged
*  Sean Fain and other labor leaders to take back that position and rescind their endorsement of
*  Kamala Harris. Not that I expect them to do that, but the point is that we have to call them out
*  for their shameful role. Let's talk about the criticisms of your position. First and foremost
*  being that Trump is worse. He recognized the Golan Heights. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem.
*  Rhetorically, he is worse than the Democrats. How do you address that criticism? Well, if you look at
*  the project of the state of Israel from the very inception from 76 years ago, that was a project of
*  British and American capitalism. You can say imperialism, but imperialism is a part and parcel
*  of the capitalist system. And by its very inception, the Israeli state was going to be
*  deeply oppressive towards the indigenous people living there. And when you understand that that's
*  the history behind it, then it helps you to understand that all the political representatives,
*  all the spokespeople, not only the politicians, but also the political pundits, the commentators,
*  all of whom who are in alliance with the interests of US capitalism are going to be
*  completely and utterly devoted to the project of the Israeli state, which includes the currently
*  ongoing genocide, not to mention the decades-long brutal occupation and as some have correctly
*  called it, sort of the slow and ongoing type of genocide of the Palestinian people. So by that
*  measure, both the Democrats and Republicans are completely dedicated to this project.
*  And it won't matter really if Kamala Harris wins the White House or Donald Trump wins the White
*  House. As far as the genocide is concerned, there is no way out unless the anti-war movement
*  builds independently of both of them. Now, if you want to look at overall the differences between
*  Democrats and Republicans and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, I agree with you, Chris, there are
*  differences in rhetoric. There might be differences also in the positions overall that are taken. I
*  mean, there's no doubt that the Republican Party and especially the Trumpist version of the
*  Republican Party does have deeply reactionary ideas. And some of those ideas were attempted to
*  carry out in his first term, for example, the Muslim travel ban. These are odious ideas,
*  his statements about the immigrant population and so on, immigrant working and poor people.
*  But if you look at the actual outcomes for various entities, whether you're looking at
*  immigrant people, poor people, working people, outcomes on war and aggression, if you look at
*  all of this, in reality, the US states or the US capitalism's history is one long continuum of
*  similar policies throughout Republican and Democratic administrations. And Republican,
*  you know, Ronald Reagan broke the strike of the air traffic controllers back then.
*  Who broke the strike of the railroad workers? It was Democrat Joe Biden with Vice President
*  Kamala Harris, who is now the Democratic candidate. So in fact, really, before the genocide red line
*  was crossed by the Democrats, they had crossed the Biden-Harris administration and crossed another
*  red line, which was of breaking a strike. So working people, I mean, our message, my message
*  to working people as a socialist, as a founder of Worker Strike Back has been that absolutely you
*  cannot vote for anybody who is a purveyor of genocide. But even before that, working people
*  cannot vote for a strike breaker. So if you look at issue after issue, it has been one long series
*  of attacks on working people, both in the United States and internationally. If you look at the
*  coups that have been carried out by US capitalism in country after country, whether it's Latin
*  America or Asia or Africa, if you talk about the wars that have been instigated from US capitalism
*  worldwide, if you look at the attacks on working people as a whole, it's both Democrats and
*  Republicans equally in equal measure responsible for all of this. And then setting aside all of
*  that, if you want to look at how Trumpism and right-wing populism has grown in the first place
*  in recent years, in the last 20, 30 years, even there you can see that first of all, for example,
*  the Tea Party movement, the right-wing Tea Party movement, that really gained ascendancy in the
*  wake of Barack Obama, another celebrated Democratic president, having broken his promises on many
*  fronts, including on Medicare for All and the public option. And most importantly, the fact that
*  this was during the Great Recession, he bailed out the very big banks and Wall Street entities
*  that were responsible for the Great Recession. He bailed them out. He bailed out the billionaires
*  and the multimillionaires. And working in poor people were faced with a devastating economic crisis,
*  with millions of home foreclosures, people losing their jobs, becoming homeless, the public sector
*  workers taking on mandatory furloughs, and in some cases, voluntary furloughs, because they wanted to
*  sacrifice and what did they get in return for it? You know, for ever lower living standards and more
*  and more attacks on state and city public budgets. And then, and of course, the other broken promise
*  from Obama was that he, you know, he famously promised no troop surge in Afghanistan. And one
*  of the first things he did was a troop surge in Afghanistan. He became the deported-in-chief,
*  devastating policies towards working class and poor immigrants. And then you had Joe Biden
*  breaking his promises on $15 an hour, on Medicare for All, on canceling student debt. And he, as I
*  said, he was also the strike breaker in chief. And then you had now, now you have where, you know,
*  Donald Trump left the office as the most unpopular president in modern US history. And now he has a
*  real chance of winning back the White House. Why? Because of the betrayals by the Democrats. So in
*  other words, not only are the Democrats and Republicans fairly aligned on most policy fronts,
*  whether it is domestic or international, they together represent the interests of the capitalist
*  class. In fact, beyond that, it's also true that the Democrats are the best builders of Trumpism
*  itself. So it is backwards and circular logic for us to be told that we have to vote for Kamala Harris
*  in order to prevent Trump from getting into office. Well, Trump has a chance to get into office again
*  precisely because of the betrayals by the Harris and Trump, sorry, Biden administration.
*  You've been attacked as being a kind of stooge for Jill Stein and the Green Party. In fact,
*  I know you have, I've heard you be very critical of the Green Party. I want you to talk about that.
*  And then I want to talk about, you to talk about your break with Socialist Alternative. You
*  represented Socialist Alternative on the City Council in Seattle. You had a long relationship
*  with that party. But let's talk about those two issues because you're backing Stein and the Green
*  Party, not because you are a full endorser of either Stein or the Greens. I think we have shown
*  a really good example on an ongoing basis with our support, Worker Strike Back support for the
*  Jill Stein campaign. We have shown on an ongoing basis what it looks like to have a principled
*  example of principled unity on the left in the interest of the working class while also having
*  a friendly debate and discussion on disagreements. In fact, even at our rallies, it's clear that we
*  have some disagreements. In fact, on the very point that you started this interview with, which is
*  our meaning, Worker Strike Backs and my very clear position that the critical objective for
*  working people in using the Jill Stein campaign this year to build the anti-war movement and
*  working people's movement is to fight to defeat Kamala Harris in a key swing state like Michigan,
*  whereas you'll hear the Green Party and the Jill Stein campaign not really embracing that position
*  and mostly talking about how working people, American people need more options. And I don't
*  exactly agree with that because it's not that working people are looking for options like
*  different brands of toothpaste. What working people are hungering for is a party that represents
*  them versus the warmongering billionaire class's interests. And so for us, that is the driving
*  force. And we also, the other difference that has emerged, and again, we have had a friendly debate
*  about it, is how do we build this campaign in the interest of the working class, in the interest of
*  the anti-war movement and the Muslim community, which is especially the Palestinian and Arab
*  communities, which are directly hurting, having their own family members lost, which is a devastating
*  loss for them, which is that we, we in Worker Strike Back, we believe that the best way to build
*  this movement and using this campaign is to be truthful and sober about facts with working
*  people. When we organize, we take the question of organizing working people very seriously in
*  Worker Strike Back. And we believe that it doesn't help us to build the morale of working people,
*  of the anti-war movement, of the Muslim community that wants to fight to end this genocide and is
*  angry at the Democrats and Republicans to tell them that maybe Jill Stein can win. We don't agree
*  that that is useful because, you know, if you look at what's going to happen, what's likely going
*  to happen after election night, and maybe the results won't be settled on election night, but
*  the point is that on inauguration day in January, it is going to be either Kamala Harris or Donald
*  Trump in the White House. I think we have to be crystal clear about that and explain the need to
*  fight for every possible war for Jill Stein from the context of how it can play a key role
*  in building an anti-war movement that is independent of the Democrats and Republicans,
*  that emboldens working people, builds up the morale of the Muslim community by sending a
*  powerful message to Harris and the Democratic Party. And I strongly believe, and my fellow
*  activists and workers strike back strongly believe, that working people are fully capable
*  of understanding this and being energized to fight back. They understand, you know, they understand
*  that Jill Stein is not going to win. So the Jill Stein campaign saying that 10 times that they're
*  going to win is not going to convince people that they're going to win. Instead, unfortunately,
*  it could be counterproductive potentially because when the results show that that Jill Stein
*  campaign is nowhere near winning, I mean, we've seen the trajectories, it's going to be, as we said,
*  if her campaign gets 1%, that should be celebrated. But how that same 1% or 1.2% or whatever it is
*  gets perceived by working people very much depends on how the strategy has been laid out.
*  If we were to go around saying Jill Stein could win or Jill Stein could get 20%, whatever,
*  and then she gets 1% or 1.2%, then instead of seeing those that million or million and a half votes
*  as a tremendous confirmation that working people are rejecting, a whole section of working people
*  are rejecting the Democrats and Republicans and are ready to fight, instead of seeing it as a message
*  of being a building block, instead it will be seen as demoralizing. It could be, I'm not saying it
*  will, but it could be seen as demoralizing that, oh, well, we were told we could win, we were told
*  we could win 5%, 10%, 20%, and instead it's such a small result. Nothing works, third parties don't
*  work, I'm just going to get our check out of politics. So those risks are very, are quite
*  significant and that is why we believe that it is important to be truthful and honest to the working
*  class and make the case in a way that will actually energize working people and we've had a lot of
*  people tell us that they appreciate that we're being honest about it and furthermore, the other,
*  we should also examine the, you know, the further point that if, if instead of getting 1.5% Jill
*  Stein were to get 5%, that would be massive. I mean, I don't, I don't expect that it will be, but
*  I would be happy to be proven wrong. I want the Jill Stein campaign, I want the anti-war vote to be
*  as strong as possible, but my point is that if you warn people in with a sober understanding of what's
*  likely to happen and then your results are better than that, then nobody's going to blame you for
*  misleading them. I mean, it's just going to add to more of the energizing effect and we're not
*  speaking about this hypothetically. We use this approach in our election campaigns in Seattle,
*  you know, in 2012, I ran against the most powerful Democrat in the state house, Frank Chop. He was a
*  speaker of the house at that time. We did not expect to come anywhere close to winning in the
*  primary. We, we were running against another Democrat actually, and we told people in our,
*  in our activism in during the campaign and during the primary campaign that we are probably going
*  to win about 1%, but it was still worth fighting for because it was the first example in a hundred
*  years of a socialist working class campaign. And we got tremendous support from working people. I
*  mean, it was such a fiery energetic campaign. We won 9% in the primary. It was a huge shot in the
*  arm for people to think that, wow, we went from expecting 1% to 9%. Nobody walked home after
*  primary election night feeling demoralized. People walked home thinking, I'm going to get up tomorrow
*  and fight like hell in the general election. Even there, we said, we're not going to win,
*  but let's fight like hell to win every vote. And then we got almost 30% of the vote,
*  which was the highest vote at that time that Frank, any of Frank Chop's opponents had ever gotten.
*  And we used that as the building block to then win the city council election, which we won the very
*  next year. But even there, we did not run the campaign saying we're going to win. Instead,
*  we said, look how uphill it is. Look how the Democrats fight viciously against us. We need
*  every single one of you out here. So we use that as a rallying cry to help people understand that
*  this is not about admiring me and voting for me and leaving it at that. It's about you getting
*  involved because we will need that movement on the streets and in our workplaces.
*  Before I talk about socialist alternative, as you know, I worked with Ralph Nader
*  in his campaign, and Ralph made precisely that argument. It wasn't to win,
*  but Ralph, who understands corporate power probably better than anyone else in this country,
*  had watched the incremental corporate coup that had pushed out traditional liberal Democrats like
*  Fulbright and others that he once worked with and realized that essentially the Zionist lobby,
*  the corporatists, owned the Congress and that if he could pull, these are his words, 5, 10,
*  15 million people away from the Democratic Party, that was the way to put pressure on
*  the Democratic Party. I want to talk about socialist alternative, but I just also want to mention
*  that the Democrats are running scared in Michigan and have prepared a series of apparently negative
*  ads about Jill Stein that they are about to dump on the public.
*  I believe that. In fact, already we are seeing their signs of nervousness with their
*  almost historic, because I don't think it's happened before, where the Harris campaign,
*  the Democratic Party candidates campaign themselves released an attack ad against Jill Stein,
*  and it backfired on them. Most people have greeted that attack ad as a confirmation that,
*  oh, maybe you're getting really scary internal polls about how you're doing against Trump.
*  It has widely been perceived by working people as a sign of weakness, as it should, because that's
*  what it is. If they're attacking her in that way, it betrays their anxiety about their own
*  election outcomes. We've seen that kind of attack backfire repeatedly. Jill Stein went on the
*  Breakfast Club podcast, which is these black commentators, including this odious woman, Angela
*  Rye, who uses her black and female identity as a battering ram against the left, against working
*  people in service of the Democratic Party. It's a perfect example of how insidious these individuals
*  are and the role that they play, but it backfired. That YouTube has, I don't know, last time I checked
*  thousands upon thousands of comments by many black people, but not just black people, working
*  people in general saying, I didn't even know about Jill Stein's campaign, but now I'm going
*  to vote for her because the whole setup where they were viciously attacking Jill Stein
*  completely backfired. But I think overall, as you said, the fact that the Harris campaign is responding
*  is confirmation that this type of combative strategy from working people on the left, as we
*  have put forward, which is defeat Harris in Michigan, fight to defeat Harris in Michigan,
*  fight to extract every possible vote for Jill Stein in Michigan. That type of offensive strategy
*  is the way to go. And the best confirmation, as we've always seen throughout our work in Seattle,
*  where we won the $15 minimum wage, the Amazon tax and unprecedented renter's rights, despite the
*  opposition of every Democrat in the city, and not to mention big business, we've seen that the best
*  confirmation, the best compliments come from the ruling class themselves because of the way they
*  respond. When they feel threatened, they start responding, they start attacking. Otherwise,
*  if they're not attacking you, then you should know that you're irrelevant and you're doing
*  something wrong. And so this is confirmation that this type of offensive strategy actually works.
*  And it's also what working people want to get involved in. It is when we put forward this point
*  that let's actually get organized to fight against a Democratic party. That is what people want to
*  hear, working people want to hear. And I should also mention that the way worker strike back has
*  been campaigning and our overall strategy is by no means, as I was alluding to earlier, limited to
*  this election. As you said, it's not about just coming surfacing every four years for an election.
*  It is about using election campaigns themselves, win or lose as a platform to build future struggle.
*  And I do disagree with the Jill Stand campaign. They have put forward this idea that somehow
*  worker strike back and I are using this strategy because we don't want to talk about winning or
*  we're less excited about winning. I mean, that's nonsense. Obviously, I mean, if our record in
*  Seattle is there for anyone to see, we won four elections despite the millions of dollars and the
*  absolutely grotesque opposition by the Democratic party, all their attacks personalized and political,
*  all kinds of attacks. Despite all of that, we won four elections. We won historic victories like the
*  $15 wage. And we left office last year undefeated and launched worker strike back, this nationwide
*  organization. So unfortunately for the working class, the example that we have provided in
*  Seattle over our decade is at this moment, the only example in the only contemporary example of
*  the kind of, you know, the fight back strategy, the fighting strategy to use elections as a vehicle
*  to build social movements. And we're doing no different here. I mean, we, you know, we are
*  talking about fighting for every possible vote for Jill Stein. But again, our strategy is to
*  build the anti-war movement, build the working class movement. And we need what we are campaigning
*  for, which is an organizing conference in February. On the February 22nd, 23rd weekend, we are going to
*  have on one day a national organizing conference and on another day the worker strike back national
*  convention. And we're inviting working people and organizations from across the country to join us
*  at that. We want you there, Chris Hedges, absolutely, because we can't stop with this election. I mean,
*  at the end of the day, it is going to be a warmongering chief in the White House. And so we
*  will need to continue organizing. And in order to organize that, we are going to need a fighting
*  strategy, this similar kind of offensive strategy in the anti-war movement. And we're going to need
*  working people in the labor movement, you know, union members, rank and file union members in the
*  labor movement to begin building a militant layer inside the labor movement, because that is going
*  to be crucial. I mean, the role of the labor movement and, you know, flowing from that, the
*  role of the rank and file against the labor leadership that is tied to the Democrats is going
*  to be part of the backbone of fighting against this war and fighting for the needs of working people.
*  Well, it's just an understanding of how power politics work. That's what made Saul Alinsky
*  effective as a community organizer in Chicago. Frederick Douglass, power concedes nothing without
*  a demand of this. These naive appeals to the goodness of centers of power don't work. That's
*  just a fact. And that segues into my question about your break with socialist alternative. I
*  read a memo by them that was frankly, I had a hard time believing it came from socialist alternative,
*  because it repeated this least word essence, this least worst dogma, which doesn't work. If there's
*  no pressure, things get worse as they have worse and worse and worse. So speak about that break with
*  the party you were associated with for many, many years. So the break that happened for several of
*  us from the organization socialist alternative, which I was a member of for 15 years, emerged from
*  long standing differences over some very fundamental questions. And so the most overarching
*  fundamental question over where the breach happened. And in fact, really saying it happened is
*  inaccurate because I think the breach sort of pre existed before I joined the organization.
*  But it became more and more potent and came more and more to the fore because we won our elected
*  office in Seattle in 2013. I mean, and this sort of also exemplifies what happens on the left,
*  which is that if forced on the left, if working people, activists, organizations,
*  if we don't fight to become relevant, meaning if we don't fight to pose ourselves as an actual
*  challenge, as an actual threat to the political parties of capitalism and to capitalism itself,
*  to the billionaire class, then what we do or say does not actually matter. And it's when we
*  step, when we working people step on the stage of world politics and actual class struggle
*  is when what we say matters. And that's when people's real opinions or real positions start
*  coming out. So the differences started emerging much more clearly after we won our elected office
*  in 2013. And as I've said before, you know, we had that office for a decade. And throughout that time,
*  most leading members of socialist alternative had the opinion that our council office was too
*  critical of the Democrats. And to be just to be clear to your viewers, socialist alternative is a
*  nationwide organization. We meaning those of us who are leading the work in Seattle using our
*  council office, we almost exclusively, we were the ones who led the work. The rest of the leadership
*  of socialist alternative really did not play any role at all. Not for the lack of us asking them
*  to they were just not interested ever. And they there were very few discussions inside socialist
*  alternative of the the only ground working and historic work groundbreaking and historic work that
*  was going on. It was over the years, it was really astounding to me that we're making history here,
*  we're changing the lives of working people, we are showing in real life, what it is to be a Marxist.
*  What does it mean to be a Marxist? What does it mean to be a Trotskyist? What does it mean
*  to base oneself on the ideas of the Bolsheviks of Lenin and Trotsky and the Russian Revolution?
*  What does it mean? It means you can lead a fight back. It means you show actual examples of class
*  struggle, meaning going up against the forces of capitalism and winning despite all their might.
*  And you know, sort of having the strategy of bending the balance of forces towards the working
*  class. That is what it's all about. And these are smaller class struggles. But in order to actually
*  change society in order to actually end capitalism and bring about socialism, which is the stated
*  goal of every Marxist, we will need to engage in far bigger revolutionary struggles. Some of them
*  will be bloody struggles because there will be tremendous violence inflicted on the working class
*  fighters at that time. But the starting point is having courage to go up against the forces of
*  capitalism, which means in actuality, it's not some abstract entity. What does it emerge as in
*  Seattle, for example? It's a Democratic Party. And I only mention the Democratic Party in Seattle
*  because the Republican Party isn't a real force. Unless somebody says that, well, you're only
*  talking about the Democrats. Well, that's why. The Democratic Party in Seattle is the powerful
*  political entity that oversees the interests of big business. And that is why to win anything
*  significant for the working class, you need to defeat the Democrats. And that's what we did each
*  and every time. In the words of the conservative Seattle Times itself, we commandeered the political
*  agenda of the city to win victories at lightning speed. I mean, this is part of a quote from one
*  of the editors at the time. But that required us to have the same kind of combative offensive strategy
*  that I was talking about earlier. And I believe that the leading members of SA, although they never
*  fully fleshed it out, one problem with their approach was they never fully were open about
*  their disagreements. But that was clearly indicated in every which way that our council office was
*  too critical of the Democrats, too critical of the labor leaders, too antagonistic to them.
*  And then also in the presidential elections, it was clear that they were increasingly moving toward
*  a lesser evil position in the presidential elections. I mean, this was starting to emerge
*  back then when you had in 2016, when you had the Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump,
*  sort of face off at that time, it was visible at that very moment. And then, you know,
*  with every subsequent election, it was more and more clear, more and more sort of entrenched,
*  the lesser realism type of position. And you can see this playing out right now in the election,
*  that article that you referenced, Chris, in that they talk about how they are also endorsing
*  Jill Stein, which, by the way, just to let your viewers know, they were very reluctant to do that.
*  They were forced to do that because of our clear position, because of workers' strike backs clear
*  position on it. But, you know, they tie themselves in knots and make all these circular arguments
*  where they say, well, we are also endorsing Jill Stein, but we cannot talk about defeating Harris.
*  I mean, that makes no sense. In other words, that is a lesser evilism in another name. So you are
*  cosmetically saying, yes, we are voting for Jill Stein in order to sort of, you know,
*  almost like having an insurance policy, like, oh, you can't accuse us of having supported Kamala
*  Harris outright because, hey, look here, we've endorsed Jill Stein, but you're also condemning
*  anybody who is fighting to actually end the genocide by sending a message of, you know,
*  saying that genocide is a red line, which is what defeating Kamala Harris is all about. And so
*  that, in my view, is lesser evilism by another name. And you can also see their position in how
*  they refuse to criticize Sean Fain and other labor leaders. There was also a fundamental
*  difference over workers' strike back itself. You know, we launched, I was a member of Socialist
*  Alternative when workers' strike back was co-founded by me and other socialists. But for a whole year,
*  there was an ongoing and really what turned into a bitter debate about what workers' strike backs
*  role even is and how should we actually build it, which is the promise we had made, which is the
*  promise I personally had made to the working class. And I took that seriously. I take that
*  seriously. But it turned out that most of the SA leaders didn't really want to build workers'
*  strike back. But, you know, they liked saying that, okay, we have launched workers' strike back and
*  really just continuing to chug along doing their internal stuff. And so that also reflects the
*  fundamental disagreement that I started this response with, which is that they fundamentally
*  don't agree with us that the principal role of Marxists should be to actively help lead class
*  struggle, meaning not just talk about it, but actually be there to win things, to show the
*  example, to educate working people and to then build future fight back. They called what we were
*  doing our whole approach. They had a word for it. They called it substitutionism, meaning we can't
*  substitute ourselves for the working class as a whole. That's completely erroneous and also just
*  completely simplistic and also it's position and also something that gives them a way out.
*  It's like an abdication of it's a disguise for abdication of responsibility, meaning doing much
*  less with your elected position. That means completely betraying working people because
*  when you win an elected position, you have a huge historic responsibility on your shoulders as a
*  Marxist to use that position as a platform to build class struggle. So if you say, you know,
*  it's some sort of false modesty, like, you know, I'm not going to substitute for working people.
*  They should do it and I'm just going to sit here cozy, take my pay nice paycheck and be cozy with
*  the Democrats. That is a complete betrayal of working class interest in the name of, oh, we are
*  respecting working people. So we disagreed with that as well. And all of this really come came to
*  a head with their absolute unwillingness to actually build worker strike back. In fact,
*  after more than a year of having launched worker strike back, the only real chapter of worker
*  strike back was in Seattle, literally only one. And then they began to take votes inside the
*  organization to further de-prioritize worker strike back to take an increasingly abstentionist
*  position on class struggle. In fact, their watchword throughout the last months of the debate before we
*  left was stability and resources. You know, it was always like, well, you don't we don't have
*  resources to do anything. We don't have we have to hunker down and keep our resources. We have to
*  bring about stability inside the organization. As I said, they didn't want to endorse Jill Stein.
*  They have not lifted one finger to campaign for the anti-war vote for Jill Stein. In fact,
*  they have attacked worker strike back for campaigning. You know, these things happen,
*  unfortunately, and we we did everything possible to to push them to the direction that we thought
*  was correct. We didn't really it doesn't really benefit for us to be in separate organizations
*  if those agreements can be achieved. But those agreements weren't possible to achieve. And we
*  could not go along with undermining worker strike back, which is a straight up breaking of the
*  promise that we made. I mean, let's be clear, working people are donated over a third of a
*  million dollars to worker strike back on the basis that we were going to build it to become
*  a fighting organization. And we those of us who left, refused to participate in a betrayal of
*  working people. So after a period of debate, we realized we had to leave. And we're building
*  workers strike back. But we're also building a revolutionary organization called Revolutionary
*  Workers. And of course, we welcome anybody who wants to join revolutionary workers if they've
*  reached similar conclusions as we have in terms of a Marxist understanding of the need to end
*  capitalism. But we welcome everybody, all working people, all activists to join worker strike back,
*  because you don't have to be a socialist or Marxist to build worker strike back to be a
*  part of worker strike back. Worker strike back stands for a $25 an hour minimum wage, Medicare
*  for all, and affordable housing, and basically free health care, and for a fight against oppression,
*  and also for a new party for working people. So if you agree with that program, you should join
*  worker strike back. And in fact, we've seen more people join worker strike back once we left
*  socialist alternative and were able to build worker strike back in earnest.
*  You should just tick off for people who don't know some of the achievements
*  you made in Seattle while you were on the city council, because it's a pretty impressive list.
*  Yes, we won the first major city $15 an hour minimum wage, which we won within six months of
*  my having taken office in 2014. We won that by launching, you know, right after I was inaugurated
*  as a new city council member, which by the way was the first socialist city council member in
*  100 years. We launched the 15 Now grassroots movement, which had working people, rank and file
*  union members, some of the left and working class oriented labor leaders. We won that victory.
*  And after we won that victory, we had 15 Now spread nationwide and many other cities, including Los
*  Angeles and Minneapolis and many other cities, Chicago, we, you know, these cities won the $15
*  minimum wage also. And we saw the $15 minimum wage become a real issue that Bernie was able
*  to campaign on in 2016. And it actually forced Hillary Clinton to lie. You know, she said on
*  in one of the debates, I'll never forget. She said, I really supported Seattle $15 minimum wage. No,
*  she did not. But it forced her to say that which meant that there was real pressure. But the
*  origination of that pressure came from Seattle having won. And it's also about how we won
*  that victory. It was won on the basis of again, going into political combat against the Democratic
*  Party, which had all the other seats and it always had all the other eight city council members were
*  always Democrats. I was always the only socialist. And yet with one office for elected elected
*  office for working people, we were able to win this historic victory despite having the hotel
*  industry that the restaurant industry, Amazon, Starbucks, all these corporations and all their
*  CEOs and their billionaires and major shareholders absolutely against us spreading all kinds of lies
*  about what would happen if $15 an hour passed. So it was just an absolutely and it still is a
*  shining example of how when working people fight, we can win historic victories. And then we use
*  that same kind of fighting approach to also win in 2020 the Amazon tax, which raises over $214 million
*  annually to fund affordable housing by taxing the wealthiest, the sliver of wealthiest corporations
*  in our city, not struggling small businesses. So corporations like Amazon and Starbucks,
*  for them to pay. This is a historic thing. I mean, because Seattle and Washington state
*  have the most regressive tax system in the entire nation. Nobody thought it was going to be possible.
*  And in fact, the 2020 Amazon tax victory came in the wake of Amazon and Jeff Bezos having spent
*  historic amounts of money to try and defeat me in the 2019 reelection campaign. So the year before
*  and we campaigned in 2019 to, you know, we said, you know, we need to fight against Amazon and we
*  need to win the Amazon tax. We need to win rent control. And when we launched our reelection
*  campaign in January 2019, I said, and this was a prescient statement that we made that this election
*  is going to revolve around one question. Who gets to run Seattle? Amazon or working people?
*  And that's how it exactly turned out. The whole year was Amazon and Jeff Bezos attacking us
*  relentlessly and us winning despite that in 2019 and then using that victory to launch
*  tax Amazon. In fact, my inauguration ceremony in January 2020, we combined that with the launch
*  of tax Amazon itself. So that shows you the example of how we use elected office. The elected office,
*  if we want to win something for working people, simply cannot be about an individual's ego or
*  career. Even if that person is well-meaning, if you make it about yourself, you will end up betraying
*  working people. And so, you know, we also showed this example of how the inauguration itself is not
*  of me per se, but of the work that we are going to launch for the next term, for the next four years.
*  And by the same, by virtue of the same principle throughout my tenure on the city council,
*  I took home as a socialist principle, Marxist principle, I took home only the average workers
*  wage and donated the rest of my salary after taxes into a solidarity fund from which we donated money
*  for social struggles, class struggle, including to donate to union strike funds when unions went on
*  strike. And we carried this principle out throughout our 10 years on the city council. And it's really
*  important to note also because the Seattle city council has the second highest salary in the
*  country to the Los Angeles city council. So in other words, it's not about taking a vow of poverty
*  or pledging any kind of allegiance to lifestyle politics, because none of that works. You know,
*  we need class struggle politics. But the point is that it shows that we are, our leaders are committed
*  to the move working class movements, which means that we are not going to enrich ourselves at the
*  expense of the working class. And we think that this principles, this should be the principle for
*  the new party that we want to build. And this should also be a principle that we should fight for
*  inside the labor movement. Aside from $15 in the Amazon tax, we also won a whole host of renters
*  victories. In fact, we made a sort of a bullet point list of the renters bill of rights, and we
*  won many of them, including a six month notice for any rent increase, a real limit to $10 for any
*  late fees, also economic evictions assistance, meaning if if your rent went up by 10% or more,
*  and that forced you to move out, then your landlord owes you three months worth of rent. I mean,
*  these these victories are unheard of. We also fought for rent control. We could not win it,
*  which didn't you know, it's not surprising because the corporate landlord lobby went to war against
*  us. And it's an illustration of how we need an even stronger movement than than we had in order
*  to win these bigger victories. But in addition to all of these victories, we also played a historic
*  role in preventing just gratuitous attacks on working people. I mean, they're the victories we
*  won are too numerous to mention, but I'll just mention one because it was a standout victory,
*  which was a few months after we won $15 an hour in 2014. There was a federal mandate and keep in mind
*  this was under Obama, a federal mandate to really it was a it was a recipe to destroy federally
*  funded, publicly owned affordable housing, which had been a lifeline for working class and poor
*  people for decades. I mean, these were programs that the militant labor struggles won in the wake
*  of the Second World War. And so the you know, this type of housing has existed in many cities,
*  including Seattle, it is fast disappearing, it's almost gone from most cities because of policies
*  like this. So in 2014, the federal government, the housing and urban development, the hard
*  corporation, they the publicly owned corporation, they came up with this policy called stepping
*  forward, which is a really Orwellian name. And what it was, was a 400% increase in rents over
*  five years. I'm not I'm a kid you not I mean, this was every time I mentioned that figure,
*  people think I'm somehow misremembering or miss reading it. But no, that's what it was,
*  which in other words, as we said at the time, it was a ticket to homelessness for many of these
*  families. And they're all poor or working class. And they were majority East African, East Asian
*  immigrants, very, very vulnerable communities. And when that happened, we got into action and
*  we built a campaign against it. And we were able to defeat it. And we also forced the ultimately the
*  executive director of the local housing authority in Seattle to also move from his position because
*  it became a shameful thing that they did. And to my knowledge, Seattle is the only city where this
*  dastardly program was defeated. So this is this is really the kind of track record we left behind
*  us. And that's also the the the approach that we're using to build worker strike back.
*  I'll just close by asking why the left, in your opinion, in the United States is so anemic.
*  I think there's a long history to this. Obviously, a big, big aspect, big dimension of that history
*  is the the historic attacks on the labor movement, starting with you know, the whole especially the
*  neoliberal era, but especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall, after the fall of the Soviet
*  after the fall of the Soviet Union, obviously, you know, you remember this, Chris, very well.
*  This was the period that Francis Fukuyama, for example, famously called this was the end of
*  history, but by which he meant capitalism has won forever. This is the only system there is no other
*  system, socialism or any idea of socialism was defeated permanently. And it was in that context
*  that massive attacks on the labor movement began, you know, historic attacks. But really,
*  the attacks had begun even before that, you know, in starting from the late 1970s, throughout the
*  80s. And then of course, after the fall of the wall in the 90s, these attacks were happening
*  systematically. I think one turning point, I mean, and also I want to say that, you know, we
*  we've seen throughout the history of the labor movement, you know, throughout the 20th century,
*  there has been a real, there's been a tussle between what I would call class struggle unionism
*  and business unionism. These are opposite ideas. Business unionism is the idea that labor leadership,
*  the business unionist leaders have this idea that their role is primarily to mediate and bring about
*  some sort of peace between the bosses interests and the workers interest, as if there is some sort
*  of meeting ground for those two things. And this is in this idea is completely flawed. Like I said,
*  even if you're well meaning, if you're a practitioner of this idea, you are going to
*  end up betraying working people for the simple reason that it complete it is in complete denial
*  of the actual nature of capitalism under capitalism, the interests of the bosses, and the
*  interests of the workers are by definition diametrically opposed. So yes, it is a zero sum
*  game. In other words, when the bosses when the billionaires when Jeff Bezos and and whoever else
*  gets well billionaires get wealthy, they get wealthy at the expense of billions of working
*  people by stealing more from them from their wages from whatever they're able to take home,
*  you know, as a fraction of the fruits of their labor. And when working people win victories,
*  when we win the $15 minimum wage, for example, when we won the Amazon tax,
*  that came out of I mean, that was a pocket change for the billionaire class, let's be clear.
*  But the point is that it didn't come out of the ether, it came out of billionaires having to pay
*  for it. And so in that sense, it is capitalism is absolutely a zero sum game and being in denial
*  of that does not help working people actually it leads them to defeat and failures. And a class
*  struggle unionism is is the type of idea that understands some of the basis of capitalism,
*  even if you're not anti capitalist, at least you understand that you have to go to go to war against
*  the bosses because otherwise, the bosses are going to war against workers. And so that it's it's
*  posed as a political battle. And the throughout the 20th century, there has been a battle between
*  these two ideas. And to the extent that business unionist ideas, you know, the idea of making peace
*  with the ruling class and their political representatives, to the extent that that idea
*  gained ascendancy, you've seen the labor leadership for the most part being tied at the hip to the
*  Democratic Party and that same leadership, often trying to make peace with the bosses telling
*  workers don't go on strike or even if you go on strike, let's not threaten the bosses too much.
*  Let's have a mild version of a strike, that sort of thing. And so the reason I'm mentioning sort of
*  the long arc of history is that all of that comes to bear for has to come to bear for us to understand
*  why the labor, why the left is anemic. And the reason I'm focusing on the labor movement is that
*  the labor movement is the decisive force on the left in either making or breaking the left.
*  And so that whole process of as Florida knows, so whenever victories have been won, like the eight
*  hour day, like all the other victories, like whatever victories that we have workers have won
*  on health care, on occupational safety, any of that, that came about with rank and file leaders
*  refusing to take on the business unionist idea and wanting a real militant fight back,
*  building a militant struggle and winning victories by shutting down the profit machine,
*  going on strike, which is the strike, going on strike and shutting down the profit machine is
*  the backbone of any kind of struggle against the capitalist class. And by going on strike,
*  by going on marches, by building the community solidarity, all of that, the victories that were
*  won were won on that basis. But there's always been a fight between these two ideas. And what
*  we've seen, especially since the last few decades, is that the ideas of business unionism have gained
*  much more ascendancy. And the ideas of class struggle unionism or militant labor movement
*  building, those have been on the back slide. And obviously, one of the crucial moments of all of
*  this was when the air traffic controllers union suffered a historic defeat at the hands of
*  Republican Ronald Reagan. But I think the lessons of that are crucial for today. Patco, the union
*  of the air traffic controllers, they were correctly angry at Jimmy Carter and the Democrats for having
*  sold them out. But rather than concluding from that, that the labor movement needs to chart its
*  own independent class struggle based strategy where we need our own party, we need our we need
*  independent class struggle, we need strike action, all of that. Instead of that, they put their eggs
*  in the Republican basket. Reagan made them completely false promises that he's going to look
*  out for them. And the moment he was elected, he went to war against them. They went on strike.
*  And it was very clear for me. I wasn't there, obviously, but you know, it was very clear
*  that Ronald Reagan and the US capitalist class were hell bent on making the air traffic
*  controllers, you know, breaking their strike and completely disbanding them as an example for the
*  rest of the labor movement. And so we're seeing the unfortunately we are reaping the dismal results of
*  that whole period until until today. And even now, even the most progressive labor leaders like Sean
*  Fahm, like the leaders of UFC UFCW are cheerleading the Democratic Party. They are,
*  you know, UAW, of course, one significant victory that's extremely important, and we cannot negate
*  that. But we see many of these other so called progressive unions mostly trying to make peace
*  with the bosses. And then of course, not to mention people like Sean O'Brien, who are sucking up to
*  the Republicans, I mean, completely shameful. So both these both these strategies of either tying
*  yourself to the Democrats or making overtures to the Republicans, both of these are complete
*  dead ends. And so if the left wants to come out of its anemia, if we want to leave a track record
*  for history, for the historical record, if we want to leave a trailblazing example of an example of
*  an actual fight back, then the very starting point of that is to break from the two parties
*  of capitalism, which is why I also don't agree with people who say, Well, I don't care about
*  elections because electoralism is not what gets the goods. It's a movement on the streets. Of course,
*  that's absolutely accurate. Elections are have a limited efficacy by themselves. However, saying
*  that you don't care about elections completely leaves the field clear for the Democratic and
*  Republican parties. And it is a specific obstacle not having our own political representation,
*  our own anti war working class party is a specific obstacle because at the end of the day,
*  people are left with Democrats or Republicans and working people and the union movement is
*  left with this strategy of business unionism, which is very much tied to the two party system.
*  So, you know, you can't disentangle one from the other. So if you want to fight for class struggle,
*  unionism, one of the starting essential starting points is breaking from the Democrats and
*  Republicans. Great. Thank you. That was Shama Sawant, Worker Strike Back. I want to thank
*  Diego, Thomas, Sophia and Max who produced the show. You can find me at chrisedges.substack.com.
