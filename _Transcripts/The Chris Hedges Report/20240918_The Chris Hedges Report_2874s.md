Since the turn of the 21st century, the world has become deeply familiar with the global “war on terror.” Framed by the West’s ostensibly patriotic and “civilized” political narrative that conveniently expands their national security power and geopolitical interests, it also pins Muslims as savage, and Islam as a barbaric religion of people that want nothing but the destruction of the West.

This perception of Islam—and its followers—as wicked and violent, spread wide and far, especially in the United States, Great Britain and other allied countries. This doesn’t happen without the help of the media and influential public figures, who shape public opinion and reinforce stereotypes.

Peter Oborne, a renowned British journalist and author, has done much work throughout his career to challenge these myths that marginalize an already historically repressed group. He joins host Chris Hedges on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to discuss his latest book, “The Fate of Abraham: Why the West is Wrong About Islam.”

# The Origins of Islamophobia (w Peter Oborne)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E0X4YzjBTw)
*  Peter Obern was steeped in the ethos of the British establishment. His father was an army
*  officer, as was his grandfather. His maternal grandfather served in the British Navy in
*  both World Wars. He was molded in exclusive British public schools and went on to Christ
*  College, Cambridge, becoming a journalist at the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, and the
*  Spectator, publications that amplify the prejudices of his class. But he was astute enough and
*  honest enough, especially following the demonization of Muslims after the attacks of 9-11, to ask
*  the right questions, to see there was something terribly wrong with the vision of the world,
*  by the ruling class and the institutions that buttressed it. He embarked on a journey to
*  understand the relationship between Islam and the West. He examined how the three major
*  imperial powers, Britain, France, and later the US, used racial and religious stereotypes
*  to justify their domination of the Muslim world, especially in the slave trade, where
*  enslaved people could often be Muslim, and in the more modern efforts to conquer and
*  control the Middle East. Anti-Semitism, he found, is not limited to Jews. It includes
*  Muslims. And since 9-11, it has become acceptable to say things about Muslims that could never
*  be said about any other ethnic group or minority. Muslims have long been and remain cartoon
*  characters in the West, branded often as barbarians. These caricatures are used to justify the
*  racist musings of political theorists such as Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, as
*  well as writers such as Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins. Christian nationalists condemning
*  Islam as Satanic have joined forces with neo-conservatives, old cold warriors who seamlessly replaced
*  one enemy, communism, with a new one, Islam, to mount a cultural war on the Muslim world.
*  This cultural war is used to justify years of indiscriminate slaughter in Afghanistan,
*  Iraq, Syria, Libya, and now Gaza. Although, as Auburn points out, not a single one of
*  the world's 50 Muslim-majority countries has declared war on the US, nor have we seen
*  an Islamic coalition forming. The result of this exploration is Auburn's remarkable book,
*  The Fate of Abraham, Why the West is Wrong About Islam. His book shatters the lies and
*  myths we tell ourselves about Islam, lies and myths that have led to diplomatic and
*  military blunders, as well as needless and horrific human suffering. Joining me to discuss
*  his book is Peter Auburn. So let's begin with the book. Now, I love the book, and it reminded
*  me very much of the way scholars had to dismantle the myths about African Americans, which came
*  very, very late. W. E. B. Du Bois being one of the first in the 1950s, Kenneth Stamp with
*  a peculiar institution on slavery. And I'm just, this is a question I have for you. It
*  seems to me that that was, from reading your book, never really done about Muslims, that
*  the old stereotypes you go all the way back to the American Revolution essentially have
*  remained in force and then after 9-11 turbocharged. Would that be correct?
*  I think that is rather true. I had never thought of that, actually, that analogy with the Afro-Americans
*  or indeed with the kind of Windrush generation, as we call it in Britain, where the anti-black
*  racial prejudices were dismantled after Enoch Powell, the British politician in the 60s
*  who tried to start a race war. And I think that the reason for it is that so many left-wing
*  progressive intellectuals shared the bigotry of the racists. So you get a collaboration
*  between, say, Christopher Hitchens, who for many years was seen in Britain as on the left,
*  or Martin Amis, who was seen as a trendy novelist really, and nowadays, say, the Observer newspaper,
*  again seen on the left, they articulate the same bigotry against Muslims as do the
*  anti-Muslims. And I think that's a very interesting point.
*  Bigotry against Muslims as do the old-fashioned racists, as there's very little correction
*  against it. And the other reason why the kickback hasn't happened, still hasn't happened despite
*  my book, which has been completely ignored in the mainstream media or the BBC, is that
*  the press, in the wider sense, including the left-wing press, the centrist press, does
*  not share this Islamophobia. It regards it as normal. It's perfectly okay to smear Muslims
*  in Britain. And because that press arena is captured by people who regard Muslims as second
*  class, third class, almost citizens, if not barbarians, there's no mainstream corrective
*  to a very dangerous narrative, and it's getting more and more frightening.
*  Well this also has a continuity. So Eugene V. Debs, the great socialist leader, they
*  did not integrate like the Pullman-Porter strike, the Chautauqua movement was socialist,
*  Rauschenbusch again it was segregated, David Lloyd George, the socialist prime minister,
*  who signed on to the Balfour Plan and the carving up of the Ottoman Empire, again had
*  a very retrograde vision of Muslims. There's a continuity there completely.
*  Well David Lloyd George, in American language he's socialist, in British language of course
*  he's liberal and a very great prime minister in many ways. He really was a radical in the
*  Old English sense of the word, or Welsh. He was a Welshman at the turn of the last century.
*  But he was also, and this is a massive theme of this book, he was very much guided by reading
*  the Bible. The Welsh Church had taught him really that Israel is the Jews of the chosen
*  people and Israel belongs to them. So he was driven by a passionate belief that in Zionism
*  right from the start of his life, and that applies of course to a great many of the non-Jewish
*  advocates for the Balfour Declaration in Britain, which of course gave Jews their national home
*  and set in motion the creation of the State of Israel and also the destruction of the
*  Palestinian people which we're seeing at the moment.
*  Well let's talk a little bit about Christian Zionism. It arises very early and is contiguous
*  with but in many ways separate of course from Jewish Zionism and as you point out it is
*  this vision of looking at the modern Middle East through the lens of the Bible and many
*  of the early British occupiers like General Allenby and others come out of this movement.
*  Christian Zionist movement, because it is irrational and doesn't make much sense to somebody who's
*  been educated in modern science and so forth, it is very easy to underrate the fact that
*  you estimate it is a massive political force. I'd say it's more than that. I think it's
*  buried somewhere in the collective American subconscious. Indeed when you want to understand
*  why it is that Biden is behaving the way he is, you have to go back not just to him as
*  a young politician, but you have to go back to the Pilgrim Fathers. And the reason why
*  I say that, and it's not just Biden, it's all American presidents. It's so deep in the
*  psyche. The Pilgrim Fathers that came to the United States from Britain, embedded in the
*  Bible, it was the only book I think they really read in the early 17th century, and they saw
*  themselves as the chosen people. Very explicitly, if you look at the places they named Salem,
*  Harlem, they tend to be biblical places based on the reading of the first six or seven
*  books or Exodus in the Bible. And this gives them a perspective that the world belongs
*  to them, that the people they come across when they read the Bible, they tend to be
*  the ones who arrive in the United States, which is quite a well populated place at that
*  time, are barbarian savages of no merit. And this idea, it enables them to kill, to destroy,
*  to break treaties, and eventually it goes into the American idea of manifest destiny.
*  The whole of that American continent belongs to them, and anybody who gets in their way,
*  Spanish, Mexicans, but above all of course, the Native Indians, are there to be destroyed.
*  And I think this is a central guiding feature which comes through again and again in U.S.
*  history. There's even a character I discovered called George Bush, a pastor in 1840, writes
*  a book about this idea. Actually, I'm going to quote from it, so just delay a moment.
*  And as you point out in the book, he is an ancestor to the Bush dynasty.
*  Indeed, I'm just getting the... It's quite extraordinary because it shows you how deep
*  in the American consciousness the idea of Christian Zionism is located. Hang on, I'm
*  just going to have to... I'm not finding it quite as quickly. Here we are. So he's a religious
*  scholar, Professor George Bush, direct ancestor of two U.S. presidents who share his name.
*  He writes in 1844 a book, The Valley of Vision or The Dry Bones of Israel. It calls for a
*  revived Jewish state in Palestine. That's in 1844. Not just to restore the Holy Land,
*  but actually to link God and man. And there's also a sort of some other element here which
*  is antisemitism. He really wants the Jews to go back, to be offered, as he puts it,
*  the same carnal inducements to remove to Syria as now promote them to emigrate in this country.
*  Now that's a very interesting idea. And I think it's a very interesting idea. And I
*  think that Abraham Lincoln said similar sort of stuff. It's a classic trope and it's deeply
*  embedded in the American subconscious. Let's talk about the presence of Muslims. You point
*  out that they are with us not only in terms of enslaved people, that's a very good point,
*  being Muslim who have their names, their religion, their identities erased, taken from them.
*  You point out one of the reasons that enslaved Muslims are not able to perpetuate is that
*  most of the women who come over on the ships don't survive. So they form their own kind
*  of nativist religion. But let's talk about, I mean I think you even point out in the book
*  that Muslims may even have predated the arrival of the Europeans. But talk a little bit about
*  the presence among us, I'm talking about an American culture, of Muslims and yet at
*  the same time their identities are essentially erased from our consciousness and our history.
*  Yes, I mean it seems that actually Columbus may well have used maps which used by earlier
*  Portuguese explorers which were produced by Muslims. It seems quite likely actually. And
*  they find it very hard to maintain an identity. There's all sorts of reasons for this. You
*  get better treatment if you're Christian. And then we get the first mass emigration.
*  Whereas the Muslim slaves tend to be erased. We do get a hundred years ago as the Ottoman
*  Empire starts to disintegrate. Or maybe a little bit more than that. You get the first
*  mass emigration of Muslims to the United States. But again it's quite difficult for them to
*  get that as Muslims. It's much more convenient if they change their names and also say that
*  they're Christian. And so they erase their identity in order to become immigrants. And
*  the way in which say, you know, Irish or Italians, etc. don't really need to do. So that you
*  don't really get a kind of Muslim consciousness or Islamic consciousness in the way you might
*  have it. You do have a very strong Irish Italian consciousness in the States.
*  Let's talk about empire. So in particular the British and French, whether that's in
*  Algeria, whether that's in India, it becomes part of the tools of empire to perpetuate
*  these kinds of racist stereotypes. It's in their interest to perpetuate those stereotypes.
*  So talk about that.
*  Well I think you have to make an enormous distinction between the French in Algeria
*  and the British in India. The British colonized India but they didn't try to change the
*  style of the land. There were very few British there. And this was classic colonialism. What
*  you got in Algeria was something very dark which is settler colonialism. In other words
*  they wanted the land. They became the natives of Algeria themselves. And this led to these
*  terrible wars. You know the wars when the French seized Algeria, incredibly bloody.
*  And then the war of independence in the 1950s and 60s when the French had to be extracted.
*  Hundreds of thousands of people died, probably like half a million. I mean really horrific
*  wars. And so the French then have a view and this, I guess I'll start that again, the
*  French colonized India. So this really, but you cannot explain Macron's France or Le Pen
*  today without understanding that awful, bloodthirsty background in Algeria. The French were happy
*  with Muslims staying there in Algeria when they colonized the place but only if they
*  subordinated their own identity to France. It became an effect sort of, maybe I'll rephrase
*  that. They were happy to make them French citizens so long as they became French in
*  their own country. And that's what more or less the deal which Macron is trying to duplicate
*  today, edged on by the far right. You can be a Muslim in France but you have to be French.
*  You have to abandon your Muslim identity, your Islamic beliefs. You have to change the
*  way you dress, the change the way actually you think and pray. And that is the idea of
*  laïcité which is now being applied against French Muslims and is I think very dangerous.
*  Whereas a British concept is more that you can go on praying as you wish, dressing as
*  you wish, you can live your own life just under British rule. And that explains the,
*  I think, very benign idea of multiculturalism which emerged in the post-Empire Britain.
*  Where you were allowed to be Muslim and British, Jewish and British, Scottish and British,
*  you name it, gay and British. It's a very warm and generous British identity which emerged
*  after World War II and is now, as I argue, very, it's very shocking what's happening
*  now in Britain. That is now under threat. The far right in Britain is trying to bring
*  in a kind of collective French analysis of how you are British.
*  But let me go back to the establishment of the British mandate in Palestine because Muslims
*  were not granted the same kinds of political rights as the Jewish settlers nor were they
*  supported the way the Zionist settlers were supported. There was a two-tiered system under
*  the British towards Muslims.
*  It's quite complex, the British mandate, in the sense that it was British rule. The Arabs
*  and Jews, they did try and manage them communally, but of course the British favored the Jews.
*  They'd given the Jews this promise in Balfa that it would be their national home and the
*  Jewish people were very insistent on building up their own political structures, including
*  private armies. The Brits, on the other hand, repressed the Arabs. That led to the Arab
*  revolt in 1936, which was a terrible business and eliminated a large amount of the local
*  leadership, most of it. So basically the Arab fighters had been killed or locked up by the
*  time World War II comes along and when you get the establishment of modern Israel, there's
*  not really that many experienced fighters there to deal with the Jewish militias and
*  afterwards the, and indeed the later on the Israeli army.
*  Let's talk about the rise of the kind of modern Middle East and relationship in terms of how
*  the West views Muslims in the aftermath of World War I. You had, of course, Wilson's
*  call for self-governance. The Austro-Hungarian Empire is broken up and is not under the control
*  of Western powers. That does not happen in the wake of the Ottoman Empire. And very much,
*  again, this notion that Muslims only understand violence or they are incapable of governing
*  themselves, these kinds of racial stereotypes further or are used as a justification for
*  empire.
*  Yeah, I think that, so President Wilson insisted on self-determination in the wake of World
*  War I. It was a very noble and very noble idea. It was a very noble idea. It was a very
*  noble vision, which he did apply to quite a number of states across the world, including
*  in the Middle East, but not to what was called Mandate Palestine, which was continued to
*  be in the hands of Britain and there was no attempt to give self-rule to the local people.
*  And the reason for that, I think, is that the British were trying to manage a situation
*  which would enable the Jews to get the homeland which they sought. But obviously that was
*  resented bitterly by the local Arabs who felt and started to realize, I think, that the
*  Jews wanted more than just a bit of land. They wanted to run the country itself.
*  Well, but you also had Syria handed over to the French. You had Iraq with a quizzling
*  government run by the British. You had Transjordan. These were all, you had Egypt, which remained
*  an outpost of the British Empire. So what was the route?
*  You've got to sort it. There were elements of self-government, though, about say Iraq
*  and even Syria. But you are right. The British, remember, installed a king in Iraq. It didn't
*  get on very well, but there was an attempt to enable these countries to become independent.
*  That did not happen. That was not happening in Mandate Palestine. Of course, the wider
*  Middle East was subject to this sordid series of deals and betrayals by the British and
*  French, which when they carved up Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc., for their own convenience.
*  Let's talk about 9-11, because 9-11 is a kind of epiphany for you. Explain what happened,
*  why, and that was really the genesis, I think, of this book.
*  Yeah, it was. When you very kindly and generously introduced me, I just wanted to dispute one
*  element of your interpretation of my journey.
*  I'm going to change the introduction, so tell me what I should change.
*  Curiously enough, I don't think that I was representing. You're right that I did write
*  for quite a number of, well, almost every kind of well-known conservative publication
*  in Britain. But I think that at that stage, they were truly conservative, in the sense
*  that they represented an old-fashioned type of conservatism, which has no kind of, I don't
*  think, equivalent in the United States. It's Berkian conservatism, you know, named after
*  the sort of great polemicist and philosopher who created the idea of conservatism in the
*  18th century, supported the American Revolution, but called time when the French, he foresaw
*  the terror in the French Revolution. It's based on the form of sagatism, a sort of suspicion
*  of grand ideas, this sort of conservatism. It's a bit, what's the right word, patriarchal?
*  No, it's not that. You know, paternalistic is a better word. I think it is a bit like
*  that.
*  Well, Berk was a monarchist, we should be clear.
*  He was a defender of the monarchy. Let me put it that way.
*  Well, when the French Revolution came along, he felt that the monarchy, and I agree with
*  him, I still agree with him, is a source of stability. The form, the constitutional monarchy,
*  which had evolved by the 18th century in Britain, was a stable form of government. I think he
*  valued and understood stability because he feared war. I think that's, so I might call
*  myself a Berkian conservative. And that is the form of conservatism which has lived in
*  Britain right up to the late 20th century, from the time when Berk was writing his great
*  masterpieces. But what the central thesis of this book is that British conservatism
*  gets captured by something called neoconservatism, which is not, despite its name, is not conservative
*  at all. It's an American, it's imported from the United States, and it has its origins
*  on the left, and it is about great schemes, such unwise projects of which one of them
*  was the invasion of Iraq. It doesn't believe in the rule of law. It really sees the whole
*  world as some sort of channel house, where you need to win. It, you have power, might
*  is right. I think it's a very dark analysis of how the world is. And it crossed the Atlantic
*  before 2001, and it persuaded Tony Blair to join George W. Bush in the invasion of Iraq.
*  And that has defined the century ever since.
*  You worked, I just have to ask you, because it's in the book, you worked for Boris Johnson.
*  And what was your read of Johnson at the time? He was the editor where The Spectator was?
*  Yeah, he hired me. He hired me, in fact, in about 2001 at The Spectator. And I was the
*  editor. And he was a very, very good editor of The Spectator. He wasn't there all that
*  much, but he was very open to ideas, great fun. He was very quick, one of the quickest
*  minds of anyone I'd ever dealt with. He saw the story, if you're a journalist, to see
*  a story, he saw the story at once. Really, he'd seen everything when I explained an idea
*  to him before I'd reached the end of the first sentence. It was remarkable. Which caused
*  me rather to misjudge him a bit later, because he didn't progress from that situation. At
*  that point, he was a liberal metropolitan figure, cosmopolitan, I should say.
*  Let's talk about the difference between how traditional conservatives viewed Muslims and
*  how neo-conservatives view Muslims. Is there a difference?
*  Very much so. So if you look at the book, it's devoted, as you will recollect, about
*  ten years of his life to standing up for human rights in India, he didn't agree with the
*  British exploitation of India and abuses. The traditional conservatism of what is quite
*  benign. It isn't really racist, I don't think. It's a little bit of management here. You
*  try and deal with people collectively and enable them to flourish, but it isn't hostile
*  and in fact it's very knowledgeable. There's a great tradition of British scholarship about
*  Islam in the 19th and 20th centuries and before, as there is about other religions. You get
*  a tradition, the idea of a gentleman diplomat, a gentleman scholar who tries to keep the
*  world from falling apart and keep the British Empire, of course, from falling apart. That,
*  I think, is the traditional conservatism. There's a great figure called Pickthall in
*  the 19th century who converted, as a number of British figures did, to Islam.
*  Richard Burton.
*  Richard Burton is another one. Actually, they're the ancestors of Philby who helped found,
*  was very instrumental in finding modern Saudi Arabia. Who is the wonderful lady who taught
*  herself Arabic and went and effectively ruled Iraq in the 19th century.
*  Gertrude Bell.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's talk about not only the difference, but how that switch was made.
*  The switch. It is still going on. There needs to be a very big book about it at some point.
*  I lived through this and it took me a while to understand. I think that a lot of it was
*  done through think tanks. There was a think tank in this country called Policy Exchange,
*  which did a lot of the heavy lifting, the cultivation of MPs and journalists. You found
*  it easier, certainly, to get those sort of ideas, supporting the Iraq war, into the newspapers
*  than pieces opposing it.
*  This idea was, the central idea of neoconservatism was that the world is divided between civilised
*  and barbaric peoples. We, the Americans and the British as the planned state, we've got
*  to keep civilisation going. It was very incredibly ignorant, if you read the pieces, about the
*  richness of the Islamic intellectual tradition. They wouldn't acknowledge it. It was very
*  contemptuous of foreign countries and foreign peoples and foreign lives, I think we should
*  say. There was no value attached really to the lives of people who opposed themselves.
*  We stopped talking around this time. I think there's somebody you and I both know, Alistair
*  Crook. You know Alistair? Probably talked to him on this. He was thrown out of, it's
*  reported, he's never told me this, but it's been written that he was thrown out of the
*  British Secret Intelligence Service for talking to Hamas on the orders of Tony Blair. In
*  my old fashioned way of seeing the world, one of the jobs of intelligence agents would
*  be to speak to terrorists or to resistance groups. Yet there seemed to be a closure at
*  some point about 20 years ago. If you want to understand what's going on today, you have
*  to understand this very dangerous transformation in the process of thinking and thinking.
*  And dealing with abroad, which suddenly happened. The idea, the neoconservatives seem to have
*  felt that the world should be like New York City. And with the values of New York City,
*  the carelessness of New York City, and the greed of New York City, and the fun of it
*  too. I'm not going to be completely negative about New York City, but they felt a threat
*  if they went to Istanbul or to East Jerusalem or to Hebron or Damascus. And it produces
*  this awful language from George W. Bush, a disgusting figure in my view, who has done
*  his axis of evil and bumping blindly into a war, into a war of the world. And it's
*  invading blindly a country he doesn't understand.
*  Would it be fair to characterize the old form of conservatism as paternalistic and the neoconservatives
*  as provincialism?
*  I think they are intellectually provincial. And if you start to look into the deep, deep
*  origins of it, I think it comes out, some of it out of despair at Weimar, you know,
*  the liberal, a sense that the liberal institutions just were incapable of standing up to the
*  nightmare, the Nazi nightmare. And really you had to, you had to abandon the commitment
*  to representative democracy, due process, rule of law, and you had to fight, you had
*  to use, it was kill or be killed. And I think that is part of the sense that the neoconservatives
*  brought to the world in the, well it starts, doesn't it, in the sort of late 90s, the
*  late 20th century, and then it becomes the ruling, it captures George W. Bush when he
*  becomes president in 2000.
*  Yes, although it does capture Bush, but in essence there is no deviation from that ideology
*  through Barack Obama, through Biden, through Stommer, through anyone else.
*  No, no, it's still that. It's absolutely still in control. And one of the fascinating things
*  actually in Britain, and I suspect it's true too in the United States, that if you look
*  at the people who gave us the Iraq War, which is still the greatest crime of the 21st century,
*  there's a lot of competition now. They are still rewarded, they occupy high positions
*  of state, whereas the opponents of the Iraq War, you know Jeremy Corbyn is the most notable
*  in many ways now in Britain, are forgotten and destroyed. And that's, and Corbyn remembers
*  was right again and again, the Stop the War movement, he was right about Afghanistan,
*  he was right about, everybody agrees about this, Afghanistan, he was right about Iraq,
*  he voted, one of the very few people who voted against the disastrous Libya intervention,
*  and one of the very, very few parliamentarians who will stand up and talk about the atrocities
*  now taking place, the horror in Gaza, he's one of the very few. That tradition has almost
*  been wiped out. And so if you want to protest against Gaza now, you'll rise out there on
*  the edges of public opinion. You know, the stop the war marches, you know, you're risking
*  your career now if you're an academic or a politician or a journalist.
*  Well, let's talk about your own career, because you make this deviation, you actually wrote
*  a series of books that took down the ruling establishment and they made you pay for it.
*  I don't know about that actually. I was very open-eyed when I wrote, when I left the Daily
*  Telegraph, I discovered they were, I'd written a very long investigation, taking me ages
*  to expose the way that Muslim, senior Muslim figures in our country were having their bank
*  accounts just taken away from them without any reason given. I discovered this by chance,
*  and it was outrageous. It's a bit like having, you know, you can't survive without a bank
*  account. And I couldn't get it published at the Daily Telegraph, and I discovered, and
*  I was furious about it, and then I discovered that it was because one of the advertisers,
*  HSBC Bank, was closing the bank accounts and they were a major advertiser. And so I
*  resigned. Now, what do I expect? You know, I'm not going to be. And then I had another
*  problem when Boris Johnson became leader, became prime minister. He was lying. He was
*  as bad as Donald Trump. And I wrote about that, and of course I couldn't get that in
*  the British mainstream right-wing papers at all. And that really, I wrote a book about
*  Johnson's lies and the collaboration, the complicity, the client journalism. You can
*  only lie if people are there to protect you in the media and to pass on your lies. And
*  that was the end of my career. I haven't been able to clamber back on board, not that
*  I want to anymore, the British mainstream media or the BBC. I can't do that anymore.
*  I write for Middle East Eye, which is a fantastic website in the Middle East. It's so interesting.
*  And I write for Declassified a bit, which is, I'm sure you're aware of it. It's a very
*  interesting website.
*  They're both great. I just interviewed David Hurst, yeah.
*  And David Hurst is fantastic, isn't he? The editor-in-chief. I feel I myself very lucky.
*  I'm not quite as well off. You know, Chris, if you write for, if you run a column in my
*  heyday for the Daily Telegraph or the Daily Mail, you're quite well paid. Not massive,
*  but you're comfortable. And nowadays I have to scrape by. But I can't tell you how much
*  happier I am.
*  Peter, I think your book is kind of foundational for two events. One are the anti-immigrant
*  riots in Britain and the second is Gaza. But let's start with the riots.
*  I completely agree. When I watched the riots happening and I realized, to say I predicted
*  them isn't quite right, but I'd explain the background to them. And this is the creation
*  of a far-right consciousness, a racist consciousness, targeting Muslims across the entire British
*  political media class in the last 15 years. It's been going on for a very long time.
*  And one of the things which you, it's quite odd to hear oneself say it, but Britain has
*  become, when you look at the main political parties and certainly the media, a far-right
*  country when it comes to discourse around Muslims. The ease with which you can smear
*  Muslims, invent stories and fabricate. And that, Keir Starmer in the general election
*  did it. He introduced dog whistles about Bangladeshis. The Tories did it all the time. And so it's
*  not surprising that you've got these attacks in the north, mainly in the north of Midlands
*  of Britain, attacking mosques, targeting Muslims. And nor is it surprising that the political
*  class can't talk about it because it's there, they are the reason, they are the, how should
*  I say it? They are actually the leaders of it. They have made it happen. And there's
*  no capacity to analyze it within the discourse of the media grandees or the politicians because
*  they're behind it.
*  And let's talk about Gaza because it's the same phenomena where the Palestinians are
*  demonized as terrorists, all of them. You can't raise the issue of Israeli genocide.
*  You can get arrested in the United States for using the phrase, the river to the sea.
*  But I think again, it is something that is kind of foundational to the work that you
*  did in your book.
*  Yes. It is utterly horrifying the way that Palestinians have been dehumanized. Palestinian
*  lives, Muslim lives count for nothing at all. And we've seen the preliminaries to this.
*  We saw it with the Rohingya genocide about seven or eight years ago now. It happened.
*  Britain supported the Burmese government while it was going on as the Burmese army with the
*  local militias was going from village to village, rounding up, separating, raping,
*  burning. And we're supporting what is happening now in Gaza. And that is because of the rampant
*  Islamophobia that has enabled otherwise very intelligent and wonderful people in some ways
*  simply to think that Palestinian lives have no meaning or there is nothing worthwhile
*  about them. They are not human. They're blowing up every mosque, haven't they? We've seen
*  the pictures from it. It's a very dark time. I think it's telling us, guys, about who we
*  are as America and Britain, that we are countries which tolerate genocide.
*  And of course, we've tolerated this one, which is in real time. Of course, there will be
*  others. And that is, I think, what I was trying to, I was intuiting when I was writing some
*  of the book because there is such a tolerance of this rancid language about vulnerable minorities,
*  particularly at the moment in this world of ours when they're Muslim. And it has to be
*  said, you cannot report what's going on. It's just not reported in the mainstream media.
*  The Times, for instance, which is supposed to be our primary paper of record, all but
*  ignored the sensational finding, the historic, momentous finding, the announcement from the
*  International Court of Justice that it was going to be investigating Israel for genocide.
*  It ignored it a few weeks ago when it came back and said, the ICJ said that the occupation
*  is illegal and Israel should pull out of the West Bank. That was just, it was given three
*  paragraphs, one of which was a statement by Ben Gavir saying that the ICJ was anti-Semitic.
*  And these awful stories are emerging now from the torture camps which Israel has set up
*  or is running now with the use of sodomy to torture prisoners. It's very well authenticated
*  now. And yet some of the prisoners who are accused of it have become sort of figures
*  on breakfast TV in Israel. This is a very sick society. And yet bizarrely the British
*  papers won't cover it. To be fair, the R.S. has been doing, the Israeli papers has been
*  doing a good job, some of them. But in Britain it can't be discussed. The same is in the
*  United States. Some new rule which has been imposed on us that we cannot see our own,
*  the evil things which our allies are doing.
*  Great. That was Peter Obern on his book, The Fate of Abraham. I would like to thank Diego,
*  Sophia, Thomas and Max who produced the show. You can find me at chrishedges.substack.com.
*  Thank you.
