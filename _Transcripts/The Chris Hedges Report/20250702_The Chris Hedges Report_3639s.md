# Will Zohran Empower or Betray the Working Class? (w/ Kshama Sawant) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y)
*  Hedge Fund billionaire Bill Ackman, enraged by Zorhan Mamdani's securing an overwhelming [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  majority to become the Democratic Party's nominee to run for mayor of New York City, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=16.28s)]
*  said he and his wealthy associates will pour quote, hundreds of millions of dollars end [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=22.36s)]
*  quote into the candidacy of anyone willing to run against Mamdani in the general election. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=27.52s)]
*  Ackman, who supports Donald Trump, added that he has an unnamed candidate he is ready to bankroll. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=33.04s)]
*  Major Democratic Party donors who poured tens of millions of dollars into a super PAC to support [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=40.68s)]
*  former Governor Andrew Cuomo in his run for mayor are also meeting to decide if they will fund an [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=47.96s)]
*  independent run by Cuomo in November or back the unpopular incumbent Mayor Eric Adams who is running [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=55.32s)]
*  as an independent. Mamdani's grassroots campaign, Cuomo's campaign outspent him 20 to 1, centered [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=62.96s)]
*  around raising the minimum wage, tax hikes on businesses and the rich, creating city-owned [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=70.36s)]
*  grocery stores, making city bus service free, and imposing a rent freeze for stabilized tenants. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=76.68s)]
*  The victory by the self-described Democratic Socialist, who was mercilessly smeared for his [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=83.8s)]
*  denunciation of the genocide in Gaza and promised to honor the arrest warrant issued for Israeli [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=91.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he appeared in New York City, has sent shockwaves through [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=97.84s)]
*  the ruling billionaire class and the Democratic Party establishment that supported Cuomo. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=104.56s)]
*  While Mamdani was endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nidia Velasquez, who serve in the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=110.8s)]
*  state's congressional delegation, as well as Bernie Sanders, they were the singular exceptions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=119.12s)]
*  The hierarchy of the party has either remained silent since Mamdani's victory or been openly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=125.24s)]
*  antagonistic. New York Senator Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leaders of the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=131.12s)]
*  Senate and the House, refused to back Mamdani's candidacy. New York Representative Laura Gillan, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=138.16s)]
*  speaking for many in the party, called Mamdani the quote, absolute wrong choice for New York, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=145.12s)]
*  end quote. Democrats, along with their major donors, can be counted on to attempt to sabotage [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Mamdani's campaign, just as they did with the campaign of Bernie Sanders when he sought the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=157.44s)]
*  presidential nomination for the Democratic Party. It remains, it seems, impervious to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=163.48s)]
*  reform. What does this election portend? What does it mean for the future of the Democratic Party? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=169.04s)]
*  Is Mamdani's victory a sign that there are growing cracks in the edifice of the party, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=175.04s)]
*  or will it drive the party further to the right and see it destroy the candidacies of those who [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=181.0s)]
*  seek to address the domination of our political system by the billionaire class and the punishing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=187.48s)]
*  social inequality? Joining me to discuss Mamdani's victory and what it portends, as well as our own [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  campaign to be elected as a Democratic socialist to Congress in Washington State is Shama Sawant. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=201.64s)]
*  Shama is a leader for workers strike back and revolutionary workers, and as a City Council member, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=208.8s)]
*  she battled against the established Democratic Party leadership and the city's oligarchs who [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=217.96s)]
*  poured millions into campaigns to defeat her, including an unsuccessful effort to oust her [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=224.68s)]
*  in a recall vote. Amazon alone spent over three million dollars to defeat her run for office in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=230.68s)]
*  2019. Sawant helped lead the fight in 2014 that made Seattle the first major American city to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=237.04s)]
*  mandate a $15 minimum wage, hourly minimum wage, following a three-year struggle against one of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=243.92s)]
*  richest men in the world, Jeff Bezos, and his political establishment. She and her allies pushed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=251.44s)]
*  through a tax on big business that increased city revenues by an estimated $210 to $240 million a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=256.8s)]
*  year. She was part of the movement that led to Seattle's successful ban on school year evictions [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  of school children, their families, and school employees. She was one of the sponsors of a bill [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=271.24s)]
*  that protects tenants from being evicted at the end of their term leases, requiring landlords to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=277.32s)]
*  provide tenants with the right to renew their leases and prohibiting landlords from evicting [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=283.64s)]
*  tenants for non-payment of rent if the rent was due during the COVID civil emergency and the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=290.2s)]
*  renter could not pay due to financial hardship. You can find her at shammasawant.org. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=295.96s)]
*  So let's begin with Mamdani's victory, what you think it means, and the Democratic Party's [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=304.84s)]
*  response. And I just want to add, you yourself, when you were on the city council, spent most of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=311.88s)]
*  your time battling the Democratic Party establishment for much of the time. Oh, all the time, actually. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=318.04s)]
*  The Democrats on the city council here in Seattle opposed every single progressive measure that my [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=323.48s)]
*  office fought for. But yeah, Mamdani's primary election victory in the Democratic Party in New [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  York City for the mayoral election is first and foremost a stinging rebuke of the Zionist lobby, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  it shows that it is possible to defeat the Zionist lobby and it is possible to win. In fact, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=347.8s)]
*  you mentioned in your introduction that I'm running for Congress right now against, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  and I'm running against this genocidal warmongering Democrat, Adam Smith, who has voted for the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  genocide repeatedly to send tens of billions of dollars to the Israeli state for the genocide. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=365.48s)]
*  He also voted for the war in Iraq back in 2002 and he also voted to create ICE. And he is bankrolled [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=370.92s)]
*  by the Zionist lobby in last year's election. APAC was his top contributor. He's also backed by [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=377.24s)]
*  dystopian corporations like Palantir, which profit from war and mass slaughter. And so this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=384.36s)]
*  primary victory of Mamdani actually has injected huge confidence in the thousands of people who [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=392.6s)]
*  are supporting our campaign here. So many people have messaged me personally saying, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=399.72s)]
*  I'm so excited about this victory because it shows that you can defeat the Zionist lobby. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=403.72s)]
*  So I think first and foremost, we have to recognize what a huge victory that is. It's also, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=408.04s)]
*  given how relentlessly Mamdani has campaigned using his working class demands, it's also [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=413.88000000000005s)]
*  a real boost of confidence for working class people nationally to see that yes, working people [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  will fight alongside you if you put forward demands that make a huge difference in their lives, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  which reflect their anger, their just anger at the Wall Street billionaires. I mean, Mamdani's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=433.0s)]
*  campaign has called for a $30 an hour minimum wage, for a rent freeze, for free transit, for [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=437.88s)]
*  fully funded childcare. And so these are things that working people need. And so if a campaign [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=447.88s)]
*  can succeed on that basis, it shows that working people are willing to push forward on those demands. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=453.56s)]
*  And it's also, I have to say, a resounding rebuke to the union leaders, not the rank and file, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=459.24s)]
*  but the union leaders who endorsed Cuomo in the primary. I mean, can you imagine what kind of union [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  leader do you have to be to endorse somebody who's so discredited that he's even too much of a hot [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=472.76000000000005s)]
*  potato for most of the Democrats to maintain their own credibility? They don't want to touch him [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  because he has 15,000 COVID deaths on his hands. He has all kinds of other corruption [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=484.28s)]
*  charges. He also has been accused by at least a dozen, probably 13, women of sexual harassment. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=492.76s)]
*  And so it's just mind boggling, although not surprising, it's just incredible that the leaders [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=500.28s)]
*  of UFCW, of RWDSU, of the Teamsters, of SEIU, all these major unions, the Carpenters, all of them [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  supporting Cuomo. So I think they have really been put to shame. And it is important to see [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=513.8s)]
*  that, for example, SEIU leaders have already now said they're endorsing Mamdani, but it really [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  exposes the unholy ties of the labor leadership with the Democratic establishment. And so I think [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=525.4s)]
*  the question is not, is this a real confirmation of the kind of political demands we need to put [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=532.5999999999999s)]
*  forward and that the opposition to the genocide and the demand to end the genocide, should that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=540.52s)]
*  be front and center of election campaigns in the coming year? No, that's not the question. This [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=546.92s)]
*  has shown that actually that's exactly what we should be doing. The outstanding question here is [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=552.12s)]
*  what will it take to win any of these demands? And that's where I think we have to conduct a lot of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=557.4s)]
*  examination. I mean, I think the experience that we had on the Seattle City Council, we, you know, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=563.64s)]
*  my fellow socialists and I, we, I had the city council office for a decade in Seattle. And what [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=569.96s)]
*  it took for us to win the historic victories, many of which you enumerated, it took what I would call [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=577.64s)]
*  a fighting strategy. And what does a fighting strategy mean? A fighting strategy, first and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=583.64s)]
*  foremost means that you understand that capitalism is a zero sum game and that you cannot hope to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=588.12s)]
*  win any substantial victories, not, I'm not talking about crumbs, but substantial reforms [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=596.68s)]
*  in the interest of a working class by thinking that you are going to sweet talk the billionaires [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=601.88s)]
*  into agreement with you. It also requires understanding that the Democrats and Republicans, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=606.84s)]
*  despite their differences, they both represent the interests of the billionaires of capitalism. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=612.04s)]
*  And so you're not going to sweet talk them either. And you don't go into the halls of office [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=617.16s)]
*  by thinking that they are your colleagues and that you're going, and they're going, you're going to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=623.64s)]
*  have good conversations with them and reach some sort of agreement with them. No, you have to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=629.16s)]
*  understand that this, this is posed as an adversarial task by definition. You didn't make it, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=634.36s)]
*  working people didn't make it adversarial. Capitalism is adversarial towards the working class. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=640.8399999999999s)]
*  The only question is, are we going to fight back or are we going to roll over and die? And so again [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=645.96s)]
*  and again and again, what we saw in Seattle was a Democratic party carrying water for the big [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=651.24s)]
*  business entities, for big corporations like Amazon and Starbucks, for the chamber of commerce, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=658.2s)]
*  for corporate landlords. And for us to win any of these victories that we won, it, we, I, first and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=662.6800000000001s)]
*  foremost, had to be clear and all working people alongside me had to be clear that we, this is class [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=668.76s)]
*  war and that the way we win is by using my office to build mass movements and mass movements, not [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=675.0s)]
*  just to come to city hall and beg the Democrats to do the right thing, but mass movements that are [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=681.64s)]
*  defiant in character, that demand that unless you do this, you are, we are going to vote you out of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=685.88s)]
*  office. We're going to throw you out of office. So that adversarial character is fundamental to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=691.72s)]
*  winning something big. Like, you know, for example, the victory that we won on minimum wage, that is [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=697.08s)]
*  the highest wage in the nation because part of the battle we waged when we fought for $15 an hour [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=701.96s)]
*  was to win inflation increases. The Democrats fought us viciously on that. We were still able [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  to prevail. Why? Because I launched the 15 Now movement in Seattle and it mobilized the, the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=714.12s)]
*  Seattle's working class in the thousands and so many of them were involved in our action conferences. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=723.1600000000001s)]
*  It was a democratically organized movement where the rank and file of the movement had the say in [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=729.48s)]
*  strategic decisions. We literally had debates and voting. It took that strength of the mass of the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=735.08s)]
*  working class to win not only the nation's first $15 an hour minimum wage, but also inflation [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  increases. And that's why today Seattle's minimum wage is the highest in the nation at $20.76. So [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=746.9200000000001s)]
*  I would just, you know, I would just say that though for the working class to win in New York City [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=754.2s)]
*  will take this similar approach. The question is, the question is not can Mamdani win through a [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=759.1600000000001s)]
*  strategy of playing nice with the billionaires? No, that's not the question because you can't win [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=765.96s)]
*  that way. All of history shows that. The question is will he do what he did, what we did in Seattle [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=769.96s)]
*  in order to win similar victories in New York City? Well, that is a break with you. I mean, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  there's one strong similarity between the campaigns that you ran and the campaigns that he ran. And [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=780.52s)]
*  that is that you appealed to disaffected voters on the right or people who just didn't vote at all [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=787.24s)]
*  on these basic economic issues. I find that a kind of parallel. But I think the difference, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=796.12s)]
*  which you just enunciated, is that you always took an adversarial position. And he has talked [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=800.52s)]
*  about making New York, you know, a wonderful place for everybody, including billionaires. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=807.08s)]
*  And I think you're saying that's a big mistake. Yes, because you, you know, in a deeply divided [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=813.4000000000001s)]
*  situation like capitalism is, you cannot lose sight of the fact of, as I said earlier, that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=820.9200000000001s)]
*  capitalism is a zero-sum game. What does that mean? It means that when we won the $15 minimum [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=828.76s)]
*  wage, for example, and now that it's gone even higher because of inflation increases being built [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=835.0s)]
*  into it, that money is making the lives of the least paid workers, the poorest of the working [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=840.04s)]
*  class, much better because even a few dollars extra an hour makes a life difference. You know, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=847.64s)]
*  it makes the difference between being able to pay your rent or being evicted and then being forced [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=853.72s)]
*  to couch surf again and again, which many families, in fact, even families with children, are forced to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=858.84s)]
*  do. But that money comes from the profits of the billionaires, the big business entities, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=864.2s)]
*  the multimillionaires. And so it is inevitable that if you fight for something substantial, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=871.24s)]
*  like a major increase in minimum wage, that will create a political clash with big businesses. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=877.4000000000001s)]
*  And that's why it's no surprise that, what's his name, Bill Ackman, the Trump-supporting [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=884.2800000000001s)]
*  billionaire who is apoplectic about Mamdani's primary victory, that's no surprise. That is [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=889.4s)]
*  him representing the interests of the billionaire class. And so the working class cannot afford to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  blur the class lines. And when I was asked repeatedly by reporters, but you speak so [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=902.4399999999999s)]
*  you speak so combatively, but as an elected official, aren't you running to represent all [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=911.48s)]
*  your constituents? They asked me that repeatedly. You would never catch me saying that I am [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=918.76s)]
*  representing everyone. In fact, I reminded them, you know, one of the constituents of my Seattle [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=924.28s)]
*  City Council district when I was on the city council for 10 years was, and it still is, I assume, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=929.56s)]
*  the billionaire former CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, extremely anti-worker, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=935.88s)]
*  absolutely viciously anti-union, union-busting CEO billionaire. And I said, Howard Schultz lives [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=942.1999999999999s)]
*  in my district. I don't represent him. And he doesn't agree with me. I mean, these are class [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=948.8399999999999s)]
*  lines and he blurring the lines does not help the working class. It actually helps the ruling class. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=953.88s)]
*  And I mean, it sort of signals to the ruling. If you say that you're going to represent everyone, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  it signals to the ruling class that you're open for conversation. You're open to discussion with [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=965.7199999999999s)]
*  them. And that discussion means only one thing, which is that they will push you, put pressure on [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=970.52s)]
*  you, and they will use the carrot and the stick to put pressure on you to sell out. And I've [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=977.56s)]
*  experienced all of that. When I first entered City Hall, I experienced both the carrot and the stick. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=983.24s)]
*  There were city council members and also others in the Democratic Party who tried to flatter me, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=990.6s)]
*  make this about me. They said things like, well, you are such a superstar, but you need to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  dissociate yourself from this socialist ideology because that's not going to be good for your [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  political career. And therein lies the problem is that no matter how well-intentioned you are, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1007.96s)]
*  and let's assume that new people are well-intentioned, no matter how well-intentioned [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1014.68s)]
*  you are, if you don't understand that careerism is one of the death knells of winning anything [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1019.96s)]
*  substantial for the working class, then you will sell out even with those good intentions, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1027.24s)]
*  because you will make it about yourself and you will immediately get the memo that in order to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1031.4s)]
*  fight for working people, you will need to be in battle mode every single day when you enter [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1037.16s)]
*  City Hall or the halls of Congress, because the only other option is for you to sell out, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1043.5600000000002s)]
*  because there is no option that you will convince them into agreeing with you. Why? Because at the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1053.16s)]
*  end of the day, the Democratic Party is a party of capitalism itself. And yes, there are differences [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1061.16s)]
*  with the Republican Party, but it's like Chomsky said, that there's a smart way to keep people [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1067.8000000000002s)]
*  passive and obedient, and that is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1075.64s)]
*  very lively debate within that spectrum. And so what that means is that in the case of the [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  Democratic and Republican parties is that, yes, there are differences between them, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1085.72s)]
*  but if you don't understand that they both represent the billionaire class and they're there [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1089.88s)]
*  and their differences are there so that the working class can perennially be dangled, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1095.72s)]
*  you either support Democrats or Republicans, but at the end of the day, the working class [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1102.2s)]
*  loses out more and more and more and is subjected to more and more misery with every passing decade, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1106.3600000000001s)]
*  then you're not going to stand up for working people. I think also the mistake is that you [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1111.3200000000002s)]
*  can placate the billionaire class, which Mamdani seems at least rhetorically to be saying he can do. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1116.44s)]
*  Yes, and in fact he's saying that in many concrete ways. For example, in his recent MSNBC interview, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1124.68s)]
*  I think it was just today or yesterday, they played a clip of, you know, he's been calling [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1133.24s)]
*  for taxes on the rich, which of course I strongly support. I strongly support all the demands [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1138.44s)]
*  that he's running on in terms of the minimum wage increase, rent freeze, and taxes on the rich, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1142.84s)]
*  and childcare funding, and all of that, but they played a clip of Governor Kathy Huckle, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1147.8799999999999s)]
*  Governor of New York, saying, very clearly saying she's not going to be for taxing the rich. She's [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1155.6399999999999s)]
*  very clearly declaring that that is absolutely not something that she wants to do, but his response [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1163.72s)]
*  to that was again along those lines of, I'm excited to work with her on this. What does that [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1169.72s)]
*  mean? I don't understand what that means. I mean, you have to use your interview appearances to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1174.84s)]
*  speak not to that MSNBC journalist who is representing the ruling class line, or Governor [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1181.32s)]
*  Kathy Huckle, who is an arch-corporate Democrat. She represents a billionaire class. Your interview [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1188.92s)]
*  appearances, if you're a socialist and fighting for working people, has to be to speak to the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1195.0s)]
*  working class audience that's not in front of you, but millions who are watching out there, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1200.68s)]
*  and your message needs to be, first of all, truthful. And being truthful means you cannot [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1205.4s)]
*  send an illusion to the working class that somehow Kathy Huckle can be talked into taxing the rich. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1211.96s)]
*  Somehow Bill Ackman can be convinced that rent freezes also in his interest. It will improve [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1217.8s)]
*  his quality of life as well. It's something that Mamdani has said as well, that, oh, you know, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1223.24s)]
*  if we do these progressive things, it will improve the quality of life not only of working people, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1227.32s)]
*  but also of the billionaires. That's simply not true in the sense that the billionaires [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1231.72s)]
*  don't want to part with the billions of dollars that they have. I mean, the $15 on minimum wage [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1235.88s)]
*  that we won, that meant $3 billion of profits from big business taken away to fund workers. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1240.84s)]
*  And you have to declare that proudly in the sense that you don't represent the billionaire class. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1249.48s)]
*  As much as wealth you can take from them, that's a good thing. That's a moral thing. That is a [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1256.04s)]
*  just thing. And that is an honorable thing to fight for. And it is actually disarming [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1261.08s)]
*  working class movements to send them, as I said, an illusion that somehow the class lines can be [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1268.4399999999998s)]
*  blurred, that somehow you can make agreement with the ruling class. And I think that if we want, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1273.56s)]
*  if Mamdani wants to, I don't know that he doesn't, I'll talk about his previous record, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1279.3999999999999s)]
*  but if he does want to build movements, and, you know, I absolutely want him to do it. I absolutely [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1284.6799999999998s)]
*  want him to build the movements. And if he's going to build the movements after he's elected, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1289.96s)]
*  if he's elected, I will personally be there wanting to rally with him. I will personally help [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1294.04s)]
*  the movement to win a $30 minimum wage in New York City, because if they win, that would be an [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1299.96s)]
*  earth-shattering victory. It would be an enormous call to action nationally, and it would put a lot [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1305.4s)]
*  of pressure on the Democratic Party to push for a $25 an hour minimum wage federally. All of that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1312.3600000000001s)]
*  would be a fantastic thing. And like I said, I am pledging here and now that I will be right there [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1318.52s)]
*  in New York City pounding the pavement to win any of these victories. The question is, will he do [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1323.0s)]
*  what is needed in order to actually win this? And, you know, in terms of his previous record, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1329.8s)]
*  the reason I'm expressing skepticism is not that I don't want him to do it. As I said, I really [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1337.3999999999999s)]
*  hope that he does it, but it's also my responsibility. I am also representing working [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1343.48s)]
*  people, and it is my obligation, my political and moral obligation to use my platform to speak the [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1349.6399999999999s)]
*  truth, again, not to send out illusions, but speak the truth. And even if not everybody agrees with [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1357.8s)]
*  me at this moment, but if you look at the record that Mamdani has, Mamdani is not new to politics. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1365.0s)]
*  He won his first state assembly, New York State Assembly election in 2020, and he has been on the [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1373.1599999999999s)]
*  New York State Legislature for four years. And in fact, since that time, the New York DSA, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1380.6s)]
*  which he is part of, the Democratic Socialists of America, they have had eight elected officials in [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1387.16s)]
*  the New York State Legislature. And they have certainly won some things, but to be honest, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1392.28s)]
*  whatever they have won is far, far from commensurate to having eight elected positions. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1400.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine what we would do with eight elected positions? Imagine that. Look at [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1407.24s)]
*  what we did with one elected position. You know, we, like I said, we experienced both the carrot and [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1412.52s)]
*  the stick, so I experienced a lot of flattery, but I also experienced the stick, and the stick [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1418.44s)]
*  never goes away. Once the ruling class and their parties, the Democrats and Republicans, are clear [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1423.24s)]
*  that you are not going to be bought, that you are not going to sell out, then come all the vicious [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1429.8s)]
*  attacks which never relent. And so for working people to succeed, we need leadership. And it's [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1437.64s)]
*  not just about elected representatives. It's also in city hall or Congress. It's also elected leaders [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1444.3600000000001s)]
*  in the labor movement, unelected leaders in social movements. We need leadership in all of these [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1450.76s)]
*  avenues that are clear that that is what it takes, that in order to win for working people, it takes [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1456.3600000000001s)]
*  you as the leader to take those body blows, because if you don't, then you're selling out [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1463.96s)]
*  working class people. That's what you owe. It's your duty, and you should consider it your honor. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1469.64s)]
*  You know, it's an honor to be able to play this role. But as far as what the New York DSA did in [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1475.56s)]
*  the several years that they have had positions, they have not won any victories commensurate with [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1481.8s)]
*  having eight elected positions. And in fact, it's really telling that Mamdani himself, you know, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1487.0s)]
*  he had his two re-elections. He was first elected in 2020, then he had his re-elections in 2022, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1493.08s)]
*  and then last year, 2024. And he ran unopposed both years, which means neither the Democrats, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1497.8799999999999s)]
*  neither the Democrats contest him in the primaries, nor did the Republicans run any [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1505.8s)]
*  candidate against him in the general election. Such a thing does not happen if you are fighting [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1509.6399999999999s)]
*  for working class people, because if you are fighting for working class people, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1515.56s)]
*  you are going to become enemy number one to the Democrats and Republicans. There is absolutely [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1519.56s)]
*  no universe where you will not have a fight on your hands and let alone run unopposed. I mean, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1526.1999999999998s)]
*  in our case, I won all of my four elections on the city council, but every subsequent election, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1534.28s)]
*  the ruling class, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, corporate landlords, the Democratic Party, they fought more [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1540.52s)]
*  viciously than they did against me in the previous election. In 2019, the most prominent, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1546.1999999999998s)]
*  progressive, quote unquote, progressive Democrats, they, Latina women, progressive Democrats, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1553.1599999999999s)]
*  they ran, openly ran a candidate against me saying, oh, we agree with her, but she's just not nice. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1559.2399999999998s)]
*  We need a nice guy, whatever. And we defeated them. We defeated Amazon that year. And then again, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1564.36s)]
*  in 2021, my last election, that was not even a scheduled election, it was a recall attempt [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1570.84s)]
*  against me by corporate landlords, by Trumpian billionaires, and the Democratic Party, and we [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1575.56s)]
*  defeated them also. So, you know, it doesn't reveal everything, but it is a rule of thumb. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1581.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a barometer. If your elections are, if your every subsequent election is not a bigger fight [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1587.24s)]
*  than before, then you haven't become a threat to the ruling class. And if you haven't become a [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1593.3999999999999s)]
*  threat to the ruling class, then you're not winning for the working class. You may be winning your [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1597.56s)]
*  own elections, but not for the working class. Well, they're clearly going to go after him. I [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1601.88s)]
*  mean, the position, look what they did to you as a city council member. He's running for the Mayor [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1606.0400000000002s)]
*  of New York. And I want to talk about maybe the three entities that will try and take him down. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1610.68s)]
*  Let's begin first with the Zionists. They aren't going to take this lightly. He has been, you know, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1617.4s)]
*  very courageous about standing with the Palestinians. Then let's talk about the Democratic Party. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1624.8400000000001s)]
*  And then let's talk about the billionaire class. These are formidable opponents. And the money that [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1630.6799999999998s)]
*  will pour into any campaign to bring him down will be staggering. I mean, it already was. I mean, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1638.84s)]
*  I think Como got $22 million or $25 million. I think Mamdani raised about a million. But those [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1646.4399999999998s)]
*  numbers will, in terms of funding opposition, will jump exponentially. Well, let's first start [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1654.1999999999998s)]
*  with the Zionists. Because I saw this as, I did see his victory as essentially puncturing [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1660.12s)]
*  that monolithic, especially in New York City, that monolithic power that the Zionists have. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1669.32s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. I mean, this is a devastating blow actually to the Zionist lobby. And the specific [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1676.04s)]
*  thing is, I like the choice of words that you said. You said puncturing. I think that is an [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1682.28s)]
*  important thing to note. Because for a long time, it has seemed to everyone that it is impossible [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1686.92s)]
*  to defeat the Zionist lobby. We saw what happened with Jamal Bowman, where it was in the Democratic [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1694.44s)]
*  primary that the Zionist lobby and APEC specifically poured just unprecedented millions and millions of [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1701.72s)]
*  dollars to defeat him. And there's been this idea, they've sort of fueled this idea that the [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1709.08s)]
*  Zionist lobby and APEC and other organizations like that, that they are impervious to any opposition [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1718.52s)]
*  from the anti-war movement, and that you just have to accept it. You just have to accept it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1726.76s)]
*  And especially in the Democratic and Republican parties. I mean, obviously, the Republican parties [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1732.12s)]
*  openly anti-worker, pro-war. They don't even make any bones about it. The main challenge as far as [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1736.76s)]
*  working class consciousness is concerned is exposing what the Democratic party actually stands for. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1742.36s)]
*  And the Democratic party is much more exposed now than it was before. I mean, the approval ratings [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1748.2s)]
*  are in the toilet. The genocide started under Biden. This was a genocidal president with a [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1753.72s)]
*  genocidal vice president. So both the candidates in the Democratic primary last year were from the [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1759.72s)]
*  Democratic party were genocidal candidates running against Trump, who's also warmongering [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1766.52s)]
*  and genocidal. So that was the choice, false choice between genocidal and genocidal. That's the kind of [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1771.8799999999999s)]
*  realm that we have been operating in. We also saw AOC go to the DNC floor and say, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1778.68s)]
*  this lie through her teeth, saying that Kamala Harris was working tirelessly for a ceasefire, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1784.68s)]
*  which we know is complete fabrication. I just want to interrupt you when you talked about the [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1789.96s)]
*  disease of careerism. She's kind of the poster child. Yes, AOC is a poster child for careerism. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1793.56s)]
*  That's absolutely accurate. And that is why it is important for us to talk about, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1799.1599999999999s)]
*  have a serious conversation about what will it take to win any of these victories in New York City, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1805.08s)]
*  let alone ending the genocide, which is a far harder thing to do. Ending the genocide [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1809.8799999999999s)]
*  will take ending all US military funding to the Israeli state, which, you know, that if you think [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1814.2s)]
*  about that demand, this is the demand that we're calling for in our congressional campaign. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1820.04s)]
*  That demand pitch you directly, directly against all of US and Western imperialism. I mean, these [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1824.68s)]
*  are powerful, powerful dystopian forces. It pitch you against multi billionaires like, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1832.28s)]
*  like Alexander Karp, who, if you've heard him speak, they delight, they positively delight in [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1840.12s)]
*  the mass slaughter of Palestinians. I mean, this is happening at another level. In fact, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1848.12s)]
*  what's happening right now in the Israeli state is at another level. So there is a feeling that, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1853.6399999999999s)]
*  well, I'm against, for ordinary people, I'm against genocide, but I don't know what to do, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1859.1599999999999s)]
*  because these are just too powerful of an entities, group of entities to go up against. So I think that [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1863.9599999999998s)]
*  puncturing that idea has been crucial. And then I think in order to actually [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1869.6399999999999s)]
*  push forward on these demands, then it is going to be really, that's where the rubber hits the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1877.0s)]
*  road, so to say, because from now until the general election of the mayoral election, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1884.28s)]
*  it's a question, you know, which way will Mamdani move? And I would say that, you know, one thing he [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1891.64s)]
*  has going for him is that the, his most, I mean, the Republican opponent is really weak, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1896.92s)]
*  from what I understand, Curtis Slivov. I mean, he's not like, he's some credible opponent. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1906.76s)]
*  No, he's not a credible opponent. It'll either be, they'll fund Adams, they'll fund Como, or [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1911.96s)]
*  Ackman says he has an unnamed candidate he wants to fund, although, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1917.48s)]
*  you know, I wonder if an Ackman puppet is going to do particularly well, I don't know. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1926.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, yeah, I mean, of course, you know, in war and elections, it is foolish to [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1931.64s)]
*  say the last word on what's, you know, predictions, as you and I both know. However, I think it is [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1937.8s)]
*  important to note that one thing that he has, that Mamdani has going for him is that both these [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1943.96s)]
*  Democratic Party, or now they're going to run as not Democrats, but as whatever, something else. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1949.16s)]
*  But regardless, Eric Adams and Andrew Como, both figures of the Democratic Party, are so deeply [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1954.5200000000002s)]
*  discredited that the chances for Mamdani to actually win are pretty strong. The question will be [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1959.88s)]
*  what he does between now and the general election. If he keeps, if he does, if he not only does not [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1967.72s)]
*  relent on his demands, which he doesn't seem to be doing, I mean, even now he's relentlessly going [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1977.0s)]
*  for his demands, which is actually a very positive thing that I really appreciate that he is making, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1981.6399999999999s)]
*  he's not shying away from the demands for even a second, and he is relentless about them. But [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1989.56s)]
*  in addition to that, so he needs to keep doing that, and in it, but in addition to that, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=1995.96s)]
*  I think he needs to, which I don't expect that he will, but I'm just saying what he needs to do in [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2000.3600000000001s)]
*  order to win the, not so much the win the election, that's my point. I'm trying to [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2005.48s)]
*  disentangle the question between, question of winning the election for himself [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2010.76s)]
*  and winning the demands that he's running on. Those are two separate questions to some degree, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2016.1200000000001s)]
*  because there's just a favorable electoral calculus right now that he's facing where he [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2022.12s)]
*  could possibly win, even if he started sliding on his demands, maybe, I don't know. But it's [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2027.7199999999998s)]
*  certainly not the kind of difficult situation that we were facing. But as far as setting the stage, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2033.6399999999999s)]
*  as far as using his election campaign for setting the stage to win any of these demands, that's the [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2038.9199999999998s)]
*  most paramount question. And for that, I'm strongly convinced that he needs to move away from this [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2044.84s)]
*  talking point of, oh, I'm, you know, billionaires will also love a city with a rent freeze, and [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2051.48s)]
*  I'm looking forward to working with Cathy Hockel, moving away from that to saying, look, the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2057.88s)]
*  Democratic Party establishment itself, the Democratic Party itself is opposed to the things that I'm [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2062.36s)]
*  calling for, and that's why I need working people to join me, rather than continually bringing up [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2067.72s)]
*  this idea that it's all about discussions and meetings with the powers that be, and oh, I'll [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2073.16s)]
*  talk to the governor, and I'll talk to the billionaire, instead of all this emphasis on [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2079.48s)]
*  the halls of power, instead, his talking point should be, and we're calling for a rally on such [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2085.64s)]
*  and such date. I want working people to show up. I want black, white, Latino, Asian, all of you to [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2091.48s)]
*  show up, because working class people need to fight together. Let's call for a march for $30 an hour. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2097.72s)]
*  Let's march around city hall, you know, that type of thing, or march outside Bill Ackman's house. I [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2103.8s)]
*  presumably live somewhere in Manhattan, something like that. March outside Trump Tower. Let's call [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2108.44s)]
*  big rallies again in Trump Tower, and it's not only that, it's also for him to say openly, you know, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2113.1600000000003s)]
*  Governor Cathy Hockel, she's selling out workers. She said she does not want any taxes on the rich. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2120.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you agree? You know, telling working people, don't put any faith in Cathy Hockel. Don't put [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2125.56s)]
*  any faith in any of these Democrats. You know, Chuck Schumer, he has blood on his hands. Chuck [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2130.6s)]
*  Schumer has blood on his hands. Hakeem Jeffries has blood on his hands. Richie Torres has blood [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2135.88s)]
*  on his hands. That's the kind of language. I mean, we don't use this language as Marxists, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2141.08s)]
*  incidentally, just because, oh, emotions are running high. It's not like that. It's about [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2146.6800000000003s)]
*  clarifying to the working class what is the character of capitalism, and its warmongering [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2150.84s)]
*  representatives, warmongering anti-worker, anti-union representatives, and how do you fight [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2157.32s)]
*  against them. Those are two very key tasks for revolutionaries, and I think that's a difference [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2162.28s)]
*  between how most, what I would call reformist candidates, or reformist leaders act, and how [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2167.32s)]
*  a revolutionary socialist like myself acts, where we, you know, start by clarifying the nature of [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2175.2400000000002s)]
*  capitalism itself. That is part of revolutionary politics, but ironically, Chris, revolutionary [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2182.52s)]
*  politics also makes you the best fighter to win the biggest possible reforms, because once you [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2188.12s)]
*  understand the class nature of capitalism, and you understand how working people need to be mobilized, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2194.2799999999997s)]
*  that is what empowers your side to go up against all of these forces, and that's what will be needed. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2199.7999999999997s)]
*  For example, like you said, we started with the Zionists. You know, the Zionists, you correctly [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2205.64s)]
*  said the Zionists are not going to rest on this. They're not going to say, oh, we give up. Oh, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2210.7599999999998s)]
*  he won the primary. No, they're going to do everything in their power to try and defeat him, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2214.36s)]
*  and it's important that he doesn't waffle on the things that he has already said, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2219.6400000000003s)]
*  Mamdani, and also he needs to go much farther along the lines of whatever's saying. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2224.76s)]
*  Well, he needs to take a lesson from Jeremy Corbyn. These are not people who, number one, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2229.6400000000003s)]
*  can be placated, or number two, will not, no matter what you say, viciously attempt to bring you down. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2233.32s)]
*  I want you to talk about what he can expect. You experienced constant campaigns to [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2239.88s)]
*  deceit you from the city council. He's running for a much more powerful position. What can he expect [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2247.0s)]
*  from the Zionists? What can he expect from the Democratic Party hierarchy, and what can he [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2254.36s)]
*  expect from the billionaire class? Well, they've already announced war, in essence. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2260.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, they have declared war against him, and that is why he needs to declare war back at them, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2266.4399999999996s)]
*  not try to hug them to death. Part of what we experienced here was obviously, if you look at [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2272.8399999999997s)]
*  the talking points that big business had against our 15 Now movement and against the Amazon tax [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2285.24s)]
*  movement, which also you mentioned, which raises hundreds of millions of dollars every year for [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2291.64s)]
*  affordable housing, including a specific chunk of that money reserved for black working class and [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2295.7999999999997s)]
*  poor housing in this historically black neighborhood, which I live in, actually, which has been denuded [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2302.12s)]
*  of its black population because of the skyrocketing rents. One of the things that they did to discredit [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2306.6s)]
*  all of these demands was to just pound the working class on network TV [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2313.0s)]
*  with all kinds of economic falsehoods, like, oh, this is just going to be economic apocalypse, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2321.0800000000004s)]
*  $15,000 an hour will shut down all businesses, all of that. So I think the first thing we had to do [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2326.2000000000003s)]
*  to combat that was relentless political education about how all of this is absolutely false. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2331.32s)]
*  But what we said was two things. One is we said that all of the studies on minimum wage increases [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2341.0800000000004s)]
*  have shown and even big minimum wage increases have shown is that there's no business has [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2346.92s)]
*  actually been shut down because of that. Small business shut down because of other reasons, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2353.8s)]
*  the pattern reason being that commercial rent is so high that most storefront businesses can't afford [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2359.56s)]
*  in big cities like Seattle and New York City. But we also said that if indeed that were true, if [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2365.48s)]
*  indeed they were right, that the system is so fragile that by lifting 100,000 workers in Seattle [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2373.0s)]
*  out of poverty, just lifting them above, it's nothing lavish, it's lifting them above absolute [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2381.88s)]
*  dire conditions is going to collapse the system, then why on earth are we even defending the system [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2387.0s)]
*  in the first place? See, that's how we posed it. And that really helped people understand that, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2392.36s)]
*  one, that they are completely lying to you, but also secondly, even if they weren't, we still need [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2398.2s)]
*  to fight for better conditions because why on earth are we defending a system that can't let us have [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2404.92s)]
*  even a modicum of dignity in our living standards? I mean, that's part of what they will face. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2409.96s)]
*  The other thing that will come very likely is the kind of red baiting and identity politics that we [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2416.3599999999997s)]
*  experienced here. So a very, very important example of this is when we were fighting for [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2423.96s)]
*  the Amazon tax, we launched the tax Amazon movement alongside my inauguration after my 2019 re-election. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2429.32s)]
*  It was really important strategic timing because, like I said before, the 2019 election was a [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2437.2400000000002s)]
*  complete pushback against Jeff Bezos and Amazon because Amazon specifically and very openly [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2442.76s)]
*  spent millions of dollars trying to defeat me and also other progressives, but mainly me, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2450.84s)]
*  and because they knew our office was the driving force of the whole left-wing and working-class [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2456.28s)]
*  political agenda, and they knew that if I was out, the Democrats wouldn't do crap for the working [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2461.4s)]
*  class. And so in 2020, January, when I was inaugurated, I turned my inauguration into the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2466.36s)]
*  launch of the tax Amazon movement. And then you remember that was 2020. So a few months later, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2474.76s)]
*  COVID happened, and then the George Floyd rebellion began. At that time, the Democratic Party [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2480.2000000000003s)]
*  unleashed this whole group of black, what I would call misleaders, black misleaders, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2487.8s)]
*  to go around at these protests saying, you should not support Shama Sawant. You should not support [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2494.36s)]
*  the Amazon tax because that's not a black issue. They tried to disrupt many of the rallies that we [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2500.12s)]
*  were holding in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, saying, you should be talking [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2505.4s)]
*  about black issues, and furthermore, you're not black, so you don't get to have this platform. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2510.2s)]
*  And we refused to accept that gatekeeping. There were many other leaders who were supporting the [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2514.2s)]
*  tax Amazon movement who immediately barked at that and said, oh, we should not even have our table [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2522.7599999999998s)]
*  here at this protest because we're just white allies. We don't have the right to speak. Only [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2529.08s)]
*  black people have the right to speak. We absolutely refused to bend to this corrosiveness of identity [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2535.16s)]
*  politics. And we insisted on looking at things from a class lens. And we said that actually, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2542.92s)]
*  these black misleaders should be utterly ashamed of themselves because by obstructing the tax [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2548.6s)]
*  Amazon movement, they are actually hostile to the interests of black working class and poor people [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2554.92s)]
*  because if there's anybody who needs affordable housing the most, it is the black working class. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2560.6800000000003s)]
*  And the Amazon tax has disproportionately benefited the black working class and poor people. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2567.96s)]
*  So rather than accepting their just destructive gatekeeping, we said, we're going to go directly [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2573.32s)]
*  to black working people at the protest. And it was phenomenal. The support we got [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2579.56s)]
*  for the Amazon tax demand was sky high. The clipboards were practically flying out of our hands [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2585.24s)]
*  with people saying, fuck yeah, I want to tax Amazon. I'm going to sign that. And it's hundreds, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2591.48s)]
*  thousands of people showing up to our democratically organized tax Amazon action conferences. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2596.52s)]
*  That is what put pressure on the Democratic Party. You know, first they were vicious towards it. And [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2602.04s)]
*  then I suddenly started getting friendly phone calls from these progressive Latina Democrats saying, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2606.76s)]
*  oh, oh, you know, that thing you were talking about, you know, very interested in that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2611.48s)]
*  And then we won. That is what it takes. I think that in terms of how it plays out in New York City, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2615.6400000000003s)]
*  I think it will very much depend on what kind of approach Mamdani takes. I mean, how much they [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2623.2400000000002s)]
*  attack his demands will depend on how much he's willing to fight for it. And being willing to [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2629.5600000000004s)]
*  fight for it means mobilizing working class people. So I think that will be crucial. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2634.44s)]
*  What does this mean in the age of Trump? Trump, of course, immediately went after him. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2640.36s)]
*  I think you and I for many, many years have argued that a party or a political movement that [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2645.2400000000002s)]
*  is focused on social inequality and the betrayal of the working class by the Democratic Party could [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2653.4s)]
*  succeed. Is this the rise of a kind of counterweight to Trumpian authoritarianism and [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2662.44s)]
*  proto-fascism or not? I think the, and as you said, you know, you alluded to our past discussions, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2672.76s)]
*  we've talked about what it will take to defeat Trumpism and right-wing populism. And it's not [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2679.88s)]
*  only Trump, you know, it's Trumpism phenomenon. And it will take working class solidarity around [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2684.68s)]
*  class-based demands to defeat the ideas of the right-wing. And it will take us to, take us [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2693.0s)]
*  recognizing where the, you know, the origin of any traction, any credence to right-wing ideas. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2700.68s)]
*  And that comes from the complete failure of and betrayals by the Democratic Party. But it's not [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2710.2s)]
*  only the Democratic Party. You know, we have to talk about the labor leadership as well, which has [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2717.24s)]
*  betrayed the interests of the working class, obviously their own members, by being tied at [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2721.96s)]
*  the hip to the Democratic Party, even in the face of a genocide. You know, that needs to be [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2727.08s)]
*  mentioned as well. I mean, the question is, if genocide is not a line you're not willing to cross [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2731.7999999999997s)]
*  as a working class leader, then there is no line you're not willing to cross as a working class [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2738.36s)]
*  leader. So I think that point needs to be made. And so, you know, so many of these unions, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2742.28s)]
*  their leaderships have passed ceasefire resolutions, but those ceasefire resolutions mean little if then [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2747.56s)]
*  the leaderships turn around and support the parties of genocide themselves. I mean, Sean Fain [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2754.6800000000003s)]
*  famously went on the DNC floor, Sean Fain being the president of UAW, which is one of the unions [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2761.6400000000003s)]
*  that has supported Mamdani to its credit, and also has passed a ceasefire resolution. But [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2766.04s)]
*  at the end of the day, how much does that amount to if you're then turning around and still [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2772.04s)]
*  supporting the candidates and the parties of genocide? And I think that it is it is also [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2775.88s)]
*  revealing what, who Mamdani holds as his role models. I think, you know, we you talked about [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2785.48s)]
*  how AOC is the poster child for careerism. I think that's very important to note because [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2793.32s)]
*  and Bernie Sanders was not exactly like our union. He's I think he's well intentioned. It's just his [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2798.6800000000003s)]
*  political analysis is extremely flawed. And he thinks that now completely capitulating to [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2804.36s)]
*  the Democratic Party and to the genocide and to attacks on workers, like the, you know, the [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2810.28s)]
*  Democrats blocking and breaking the railroad workers strike in 2022, which AOC was part of, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2816.44s)]
*  that that's the best that the working class can get. But regardless, you know, regardless of their [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2822.68s)]
*  individual differences, the truth about AOC and Bernie Sanders is that they both of them [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2827.4s)]
*  have campaigned, I mean, Bernie Sanders much more relentlessly, but AOC did initially campaign [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2832.52s)]
*  on Medicare for all $15 an hour minimum wage and a Green New Deal. And like I said, I commend [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2838.28s)]
*  Mamdani for being relentless about those demands. But, but Bernie Sanders has also been relentless [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2846.44s)]
*  about those demands. He still is talking about I mean, he's less relentless than before, because [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2853.2400000000002s)]
*  he doesn't want to embarrass the Democrats, which is itself rotten. However, the point is that they [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2857.48s)]
*  both have campaigned on these demands. And not a thing, not a thing has been won for the working [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2863.7200000000003s)]
*  class. The metric cannot be are they talking about those demands, the metric has to be what have they [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2870.44s)]
*  won in the last five, six years, what have they done? And what have what has happened to working [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2875.16s)]
*  class agendas in the in that interim, the Bernie Sanders two campaigns were completely destroyed [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2881.08s)]
*  by the Democratic Party. And last year, the Democratic Party showed that they would much rather [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2888.2s)]
*  allow somebody who they call a fascist and an existential threat allow that person to be elected [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2895.48s)]
*  than allow even a shadow of working class agenda to enter their purview. Like they did not even want [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2904.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris to even lie. I mean, just fucking lie that, okay, I'm going to do something about [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2911.56s)]
*  the genocide. Maybe I'll talk about 15. And she if she had done any one of a little bit of murmuring [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2916.1200000000003s)]
*  towards the working class, and she would have tipped the scales, very likely, they were not [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2922.6800000000003s)]
*  even willing to do that. Why? Because they don't want to create expectations among working class [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2927.2400000000002s)]
*  people that they will do anything at all for them, because they they want to hold the line, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2933.24s)]
*  they are the billionaire class representatives, just like the republicans are, and they don't want [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2937.7999999999997s)]
*  to create any such idea that or the working class can have can expect anything from them. So what [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2943.7999999999997s)]
*  they want to do is they want the the they want the working class to be permanently attached to them [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2948.3599999999997s)]
*  and keep voting them in, but they want to do it on the basis of not doing anything for the working [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2955.72s)]
*  class. And that is that contradiction that conundrum is what has led them to this sorry state [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2961.64s)]
*  where they have the lowest approval ratings historically. But at the same time, if we don't [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2967.24s)]
*  provide an alternative to them, then they are, you know, they're probably going to make gains in the [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2972.8399999999997s)]
*  midterm elections, because people are also angry at Trump. And Trump is no alternative either. And [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2977.08s)]
*  so for defeating the right wing, we will need a break from the Democratic Party. And that might [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2981.4s)]
*  sound like a contradiction in terms of that that's precisely what we need, because it is the Democratic [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2987.24s)]
*  Party that has given you Donald Trump, the Democratic Party are the best builders of Trumpism. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2992.44s)]
*  And to in order to destroy Trumpism, you need to destroy the Democratic Party. And that comes [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=2998.6s)]
*  first with breaking your ties with Democratic Party. And here's what I have to say, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3003.8799999999997s)]
*  whom Mamdani has listed as his role models is a very telling story to me. Mamdani has said [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3008.8399999999997s)]
*  that he is very inspired by I mean, I'm not quoting him, I'm paraphrasing what he said he's [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3016.6s)]
*  very inspired by Boston Governor Michelle Wu. Michelle Wu ran on housing demands. She also [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3022.44s)]
*  brought them up relentlessly. She talked about rent control relentlessly. What has she done after [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3029.24s)]
*  she got into office completely betray working class renters, I mean, just completely. He has [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3033.16s)]
*  also said that former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was the best in his in his mom Donnie's [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3039.48s)]
*  lifetime. You know what, among other attacks on unions and workers, Mayor de Blasio and Governor [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3045.24s)]
*  Andrew Cuomo together in 2018 upheld the Taylor law of New York, which has a draconian strike ban [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3051.56s)]
*  on public sector unions. According to an article in the DSA aligned publication Jacobin, this New [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3059.24s)]
*  York strike ban, it's a this is a quote, makes red state anti strike laws look like pieces of fluff. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3067.56s)]
*  And keep in mind 2018 was the year of the historic public school teacher strikes in red states, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3074.52s)]
*  starting with West Virginia. The Jacobin article also says the next time a new Republican governor [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3080.52s)]
*  works up the nerve to enforce anti strike laws against public workers, they'll have the satisfaction [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3086.52s)]
*  of piggybacking on those democratic friends of labor, Cuomo and de Blasio. So I mean, so he has [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3091.88s)]
*  stated AOC, Bernie Sanders, Michelle Wu and de Blasio all as his as his inspirations, and they [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3099.1600000000003s)]
*  all they all have a record of selling out working class people. One last thing that he has said, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3108.36s)]
*  he has also repeatedly cited and effusively praised former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3115.2400000000002s)]
*  who was a Republican mayor who was supported at the time in 1941, you know, during the war, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3122.04s)]
*  he was running for reelection. And he was supported by the rotten Stalinists. And they, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3127.08s)]
*  you know, they supported him against Trotskyist James Cannon, you know, he was Trotskyist at the [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3133.72s)]
*  time, who ran on a pro worker anti war platform. And you know, one of the things LaGuardia did [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3138.92s)]
*  was brutally go after striking transport workers, you know, basically telling them [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3145.48s)]
*  that the country is at war, so municipal workers don't have the right to go on strike. So I mean, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3150.04s)]
*  you know, your list, your viewers can can reach their own conclusions about what it means when [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3155.0s)]
*  somebody ties themselves so closely to a whole string of people who have a track record of having [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3161.64s)]
*  sold out workers. Let's just close by talking about your own campaign. Where are you? You know, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3169.08s)]
*  what are you up against? You mentioned at the beginning of the interview a little bit about [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3176.12s)]
*  who you're running against. Yes, we're running for US Congress from the Washington state's [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3182.04s)]
*  ninth congressional district, which includes a part of Seattle and also many other neighboring [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3189.16s)]
*  cities, where there are lots of rich people, there's lots of billionaires, but there's also [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3195.48s)]
*  lots of working class people, lots of refugees, it's a majority minority district. There, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3200.36s)]
*  the district has a lot of people who have personally faced losses, family losses in [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3205.96s)]
*  Gaza through the genocide. There are many East African and East Asian and South Asian [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3213.16s)]
*  working class people who live here, many of whom are struggling to get by. And we are running [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3221.48s)]
*  against Adam Smith, who has been in Congress for nearly 30 years. And he, you know, he, as I said [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3226.28s)]
*  before, he has repeatedly voted to send tens of billions of dollars of funding to the Israeli [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3234.6s)]
*  military throughout the genocide. That's not the first time he has said he has voted to send money [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3242.68s)]
*  to Israel over and over during his nearly 30 year career. But especially notable is that he has [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3247.0s)]
*  repeatedly voted to fund the genocide. And he is not surprisingly, he is a favorite of [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3257.32s)]
*  the military contractors, you know, we know that both Democratic and Republican parties are [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3265.48s)]
*  warmongering parties, they have been purveyors of endless brutal wars throughout their history. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3270.1200000000003s)]
*  And Adam Smith is one of the generals among the Warhawks. He is not a foot soldier, he has never [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3275.6400000000003s)]
*  met a war that he didn't like. He has demonized anti-genocide activists as totalitarian, as [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3281.08s)]
*  extremists, as left-wing fascists. He has called for them to be arrested. He also holds the shameful [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3288.92s)]
*  distinction of being one of only five sitting Democratic Congress members who voted for the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3295.64s)]
*  Iraq war, as I said, in 2002. He supported the wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3300.7599999999998s)]
*  Yemen, and the current bloody, interimperialist proxy war in Ukraine. He has been bankrolled for [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3307.48s)]
*  three decades by weapons industry profiteers such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Palantir, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3313.88s)]
*  as I mentioned earlier. And he's a darling of AIPAC and the Zionist lobby. As I said, AIPAC was [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3321.32s)]
*  his biggest funder last year. And he, you know, just to contrast between our campaign and him, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3328.12s)]
*  in the summer of 2014, that was my second year on the city council, I used my city council position [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3335.88s)]
*  not only to attend protests against Israel's indiscriminate bombardment of Gaza at the time, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3342.04s)]
*  but also to draft a public letter calling for an end to all U.S. military aid to Israel and the [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3347.56s)]
*  brutal settlements in Palestinian territories and the occupation. During that same time that I was [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3354.6800000000003s)]
*  doing that, Adam Smith was enthusiastically backing Israel's Iron Dome system, which, as we know, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3361.4s)]
*  is one of the key components in enabling the Israeli state slaughter apparatus against the [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3367.56s)]
*  Palestinian people. And in the final days of my decade in City Hall, in October and November of [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3373.32s)]
*  2023, I was fighting to win. And we did win, despite the opposition of the Democrats, the second at the [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3380.52s)]
*  time and the strongest city council resolution calling for a ceasefire and an end to all U.S. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3387.0s)]
*  military aid to Israel. At that same moment, Smith was part of Biden's cabal that was monstrously [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3391.8s)]
*  insisting on over $100 billion of military funding for not just Israel, but also for Ukraine, instead [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3399.0s)]
*  of funding the needs of the cost of living crisis here faced by working people here. And he's also [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3405.08s)]
*  just one of the most thoroughly corporate, pro-corporate politicians. And in fact, you know, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3410.92s)]
*  our race against Adam Smith goes to your other question as well, is what will it take to defeat [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3416.1200000000003s)]
*  the right wing? It will take destroying the Democratic Party, and that begins also, as I said, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3420.76s)]
*  with defeating Congress members like Adam Smith, because during the George W. Bush presidency, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3426.76s)]
*  when the nation was, of course, going rightward because of the rightward push by the Bush [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3435.56s)]
*  presidency, Smith, instead of advising that the Democrats should, you know, be more pro-working [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3439.8s)]
*  class, less pro-war, his advice to Democrats was to reduce the contrast between themselves [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3445.32s)]
*  and the Republicans. And at that time, he said the Democratic Party should consider privatizing [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3451.1600000000003s)]
*  Medicare. So it's no surprise there that notorious corporations like United Healthcare, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3456.2000000000003s)]
*  which ferociously oppose Medicare for All, have also donated to Smith's campaign. He also voted [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3461.8s)]
*  in favor of the bailout of big banks in 2008 while ordinary people were left to rot. So, you [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3467.0s)]
*  know, this is his track record. We have our track record from the city council, from the decade on [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3473.88s)]
*  the city council, having won historic victories for the working class. This congressional campaign, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3481.24s)]
*  just like all of our election campaigns, is not in service of my personal political career. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3486.2s)]
*  It is a vehicle to build movements, and the movements we are specifically focusing on [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3493.64s)]
*  through our congressional campaign is to end the genocide and the U.S. military funding and the [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3499.16s)]
*  occupation. And we're also calling for stopping all the deportations and shutting down the [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3505.3199999999997s)]
*  detention centers. And we are also fighting for free healthcare for all, funded by Taxing the Rich [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3511.8799999999997s)]
*  and for rent control nationally. In fact, we are pairing the congressional campaign with a [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3519.48s)]
*  citywide, Seattle citywide ballot initiative campaign for free healthcare for all, funded by [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3524.6s)]
*  increasing the Amazon tax that we've already won, increasing it to $5 billion. So this is a campaign [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3530.92s)]
*  for all working people who want to win big victories for ourselves, send a stinging message [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3537.08s)]
*  to the ruling class, to the Zionist lobby. So nationally, whoever is listening, whoever is [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3544.28s)]
*  watching this, you need to get involved in this campaign. We actually, you know, something exciting [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FU7vtb2_5Y&t=3549.1600000000003s)]
