# Everything You Need To Know About War With Iran (w/ Alastair Crooke) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI)
*  The 12-day conflict between Israel, the United States and Iran is not over. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=0.0s)]
*  It is the first phase of what could become an endless war, much like Israel's decades-long [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=15.16s)]
*  sporadic war against Lebanon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=20.56s)]
*  The attacks on Iran, as with the invasion and occupation of Iraq, was based on a lie. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=23.26s)]
*  Neither U.S. intelligence nor the United Nations concurred with Netanyahu and Trump's claim [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=29.6s)]
*  that Iran was weaponizing its enriched uranium. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=35.24s)]
*  Israel was able to inflict significant damage on Iran, including what it says were the targeted [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  assassinations of 30 senior security officials and 11 senior nuclear scientists. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=43.94s)]
*  But Israel and the United States do not appear to have, as Donald Trump insisted, obliterated [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=50.72s)]
*  Iran's nuclear weapons program. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=56.36s)]
*  At best, it probably set back any enrichment program by only a few weeks or months, should [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=58.82s)]
*  Iran decide to build a bomb. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=65.42s)]
*  Iran's surface-to-surface missiles probably caused more damage and casualties than Israel [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=68.66s)]
*  expected, but because the Israeli Air Force had virtual control over the skies of Iran, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  it was able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficiency. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=79.38s)]
*  By shredding the nuclear agreement with Iran in Trump's first administration, which the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=84.7s)]
*  Iranians were abiding by, and then allowing Israel to carry out an attack while negotiations [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  were ongoing with Iran, the United States and Israel have effectively shut the door [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=94.28s)]
*  on any diplomatic resolution to the conflict. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  The failure of European governments to condemn the bombing, a flagrant violation of Iran's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  sovereignty, has only widened the divide between Iran and the West. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=107.62s)]
*  Rather than weaken the Iranian regime, these attacks have enraged Iranians, especially [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=113.3s)]
*  young Iranians, who poured into the streets in the millions for the funerals of the victims [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  of Israel's attacks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  It has hardened the resolve of Iran's rulers, who have suspended cooperation with the International [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=126.36s)]
*  Atomic Energy Agency and rejected calls by the Trump administration to resume negotiations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=132.5s)]
*  Joining me to discuss the fallout from this 12-day war and what comes next is Alistair [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=140.02s)]
*  Crook, a former British diplomat who served for many years in the Middle East, working [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=145.24s)]
*  as a security adviser to the EU Special Envoy to the Middle East, as well as helping lead [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=151.02s)]
*  efforts to set up negotiations and truces between Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=157.14000000000001s)]
*  resistance groups with Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  He is also the author of Resistance, the Essence of the Islamist Revolution, which analyzes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=166.18s)]
*  the ascendancy of Islamic movements in the Middle East. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=172.54s)]
*  You can find his work at conflictsforum.substack.com. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=176.88s)]
*  Let's begin with a question that has puzzled me since these attacks began, and that is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=184.54s)]
*  Why was it so easy for Israel to take out Iran's air defenses, which were a mixture [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  of Iranian-produced air defenses, of course, but also Russian air defenses? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's a certain deception about what happened there. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=203.38000000000002s)]
*  I know that it is advertised by Israel and by many in the United States that there was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=211.86s)]
*  open skies and that Israel could actually come across and destroy the air defenses. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  That actually is not true. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=226.44s)]
*  In fact, if you look, you'll find there is not a single video. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  Many people were taking, you know, shots from their smartphones and things, not a single [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=233.76s)]
*  video of an Israeli aircraft over Tehran or Iran as a whole. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  What happened? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  It's really very interesting because it has a very important impact. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=247.6s)]
*  What happened was that well before the 13th of June's surprise attack that Israel mounted [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=252.76s)]
*  on Iran, Israel Mossad and its special forces were pre-positioning anti-tank strike, anti-tank [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=263.24s)]
*  weapons from Kurdistan area, from Erbil and the Kurdistan area of Iraq across the border [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=273.96s)]
*  into Iran, quite close, as close as they could get to the air defense systems that were present. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  And then special forces, Israelis have admitted they had special forces in Iran at that time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  And the special forces then were using, coming and using ballistic missiles guided by American [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=302.08s)]
*  software, the Battlescape software system onto the targets that they wanted. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  Now there were no aircraft crossing into Iranian airspace except that some aircraft from Israel [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=317.28s)]
*  flew right along the north of Iran, which is very mountainous and really deserted, into [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=326.64s)]
*  Azerbaijan airspace. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=333.36s)]
*  And from Azerbaijan, Israel launched drones, attack drones. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  They didn't have such a big warhead, but they also then flew down the Caspian till they [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=343.56s)]
*  were opposite Tehran. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=349.3s)]
*  And from there, the Israeli planes fired these latest cruise missile, ballistic cruise missiles. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=351.28s)]
*  Those are the ones that hit Tehran and made a big impact on it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=360.0s)]
*  So it was a very complicated setup that had taken months, if not years for Mossad to put [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  all of those into position to infiltrate people, pre-position them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=372.94s)]
*  What took out the Iranian air defenses in the first day was actually a cyber attack, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=378.92s)]
*  a really major cyber attack on their air defenses. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=386.44s)]
*  And they managed to undo that and to correct it with ATARS, after which their air defenses [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=391.8s)]
*  were working again. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=398.88s)]
*  And you can see there's evidence, we can see quite clear evidence of that happening. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=399.88s)]
*  Why was Iran in such a vulnerable position? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=404.74s)]
*  Well, that's quite interesting too, because actually on that day, the 13th of June, scheduled, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=408.04s)]
*  long scheduled, and with the Iranians expecting to go to talks on the Sunday with Witkoff [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=415.44000000000005s)]
*  in Oman and the Americans to talk about the nuclear program, the IRGC had a big program, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  a big exercise prepared with Naval and other forces engaged with us. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  And some of the missile launches were actually exposed and put out because of this big exercise. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=437.04s)]
*  I think it involved the Chinese too, as well. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=442.04s)]
*  But so they were all in those headquarters in a single room in the headquarters when [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=446.16s)]
*  Israeli decapitated the line commanders of the IRGC and the military staff who were all [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=454.58000000000004s)]
*  preparing for this big exercise. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  And they were taken by surprise and the decapitation happened. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=466.16s)]
*  What happened with the civilian scientists, they were killed by spike missiles fired directly [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  and small ballistic missiles fired by probably the special forces, I'm not quite sure, into [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=481.44s)]
*  their homes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  Precise strikes into the homes, killing them and their families too. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=488.84000000000003s)]
*  I think it's 11 or 11 scientists were killed. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=495.2s)]
*  So that was really what happened. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=500.56s)]
*  Now the most important, there are two important things that flow from this. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=504.36s)]
*  The first is this setup is not repeatable. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  You can't, I mean, it was a very sophisticated, long prepared positioning people in the site, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=512.92s)]
*  both from the north, from Azerbaijan and across the border from Kurdistan, the MEK [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=521.8s)]
*  coming across Kurdistan, setting all these up. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=530.64s)]
*  The cyber attack was set up and prepared and everything was ready for this. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=535.1999999999999s)]
*  But now it's exposed. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=541.5999999999999s)]
*  You can't go back to it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  And also that now, I mean, the Iranian air defenses are fully operational. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=545.28s)]
*  They're getting more air defenses from the Chinese. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=551.72s)]
*  So it won't be the same. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=555.24s)]
*  You can't just repeat that operation. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=556.4s)]
*  And the talk about open skies was very deceptive, was really a lie. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=558.84s)]
*  It wasn't open skies. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=566.0s)]
*  It was actually something rather different that happened. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=568.88s)]
*  So that's very important that, you know, it's not something can be repeated. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=572.84s)]
*  Israel can't do this next week or the week after. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=577.4s)]
*  It would take months if possible. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=579.64s)]
*  But in the meantime, Iran is, of course, operating in around Erbil and Kurdistan. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=582.24s)]
*  You've probably seen there be many explosions and attacks in the north, removing Baluchis [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=588.72s)]
*  and refugees from across the border from that area. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=595.64s)]
*  And there is a tough conversation taking place between Russia and Aliyev, the head [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=600.12s)]
*  of the Azzar state, and also from Iran. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=607.32s)]
*  So there is a great deal of tension there from Azerbaijan and Russia about different [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=619.4s)]
*  things. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=627.24s)]
*  It used to have good relations, but now it's very tense indeed. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=629.4s)]
*  The Russians suspect that not only those tactics of infiltration of saboteurs were done, if [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  you like, during that attack on Russia's strategic former force out of Kazakhstan, but they think [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=644.88s)]
*  some of them were done by part of the illegal and criminal gangs who are Azeris as well [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=652.9599999999999s)]
*  as Russian citizens. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=660.9599999999999s)]
*  And behind us, Russia sees the hand of Turkey and NATO for both the attack in Iran and also [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=663.68s)]
*  the attack that took place, I think it was called the Spider's Web attack on those strategic [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=672.8399999999999s)]
*  bombers that were out and open on again the day before peace talks were taking place. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=682.24s)]
*  Let's talk about the American strike. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=690.0s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, it was my understanding that the Israelis did take out air defenses [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=692.8s)]
*  to open a corridor for American bombers, but maybe that's incorrect. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  And secondly, let's talk about the 408 kilograms of enriched uranium, I think they're supposedly [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=706.44s)]
*  at 60 percent, but let's talk about the American strike. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=713.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, the Americans warned these Iranians beforehand, either I think probably through [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=719.8800000000001s)]
*  the Swiss embassy in Tehran or through, but equally likely through Oman, warned them in [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=729.2800000000001s)]
*  advance and also told them it was once and done, it would be one strike, finish, end [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=736.32s)]
*  of the process. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=743.72s)]
*  So they passed that information to the Iranians. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=745.88s)]
*  And I believe I can't vouch for it perfectly, but my understanding is that the Russians [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=749.84s)]
*  said to them, look, just let it happen. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=755.2s)]
*  It's much better. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=758.6s)]
*  Just let it happen. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=759.96s)]
*  You probably won't, it won't be as damaging as it may be advertised. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=761.48s)]
*  Just let it happen. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=768.12s)]
*  And it's true because on that time it's fairly clear. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=769.4s)]
*  There was no evidence you can see of any great, if you like, you know, air defenses being [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=772.76s)]
*  used or mounted or explosions. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=782.36s)]
*  Iranians tell me, I was in Iran just before this happened. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  The Iranians tell me it was very quiet that night. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=789.24s)]
*  There was nothing happening. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=791.96s)]
*  So they just came in, they did what they wanted to do, and then they left. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=793.32s)]
*  What success they had? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=799.96s)]
*  Well, you know, nobody can really say, I mean, at this stage, anyone who tells you or says [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  they know, I don't think is telling the truth because the only way you know, there are about [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=807.6s)]
*  five entrances to Fordow, five different entrances. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=814.08s)]
*  Two of them were blocked up with soil by the Iranians before the strike, two days before. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  And the whole basis of this depends on a very controversial piece of, if you like, mechanics. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=824.2800000000001s)]
*  Most of those entrances to the Fordow base have got blast bends in them. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=835.64s)]
*  In other words, if there's an explosion, it can't go any further. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=842.08s)]
*  It can't reach the centrifuge hole. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=845.32s)]
*  Centrifuge hole, don't forget, is at 800 meters depth in this mountain. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=847.88s)]
*  And then there is an event. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=853.7600000000001s)]
*  And this is a source of controversy in America as anywhere else is according to the Americans [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=856.84s)]
*  and who briefed Trump. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=863.96s)]
*  The vent had no, if you like, bend in it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=865.72s)]
*  It was vertical, straight from the surface down to the to the centrifuge hole. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=869.56s)]
*  And many experts, professors from MIT and others are very adamant and saying it's [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  unbelievable that the Iranians would have put blast bends in all of the entrances, but [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=883.8399999999999s)]
*  have forget to do it in the vent. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=889.04s)]
*  Well, I don't know the answer to that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=891.56s)]
*  You have to go and ask the professor about that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=894.1199999999999s)]
*  But yes, four days beforehand, there were trucks at Fordow and the Iranians and there's [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=898.32s)]
*  some, I think there's some reasonably reliable reporting that the highly enriched uranium [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  was removed and probably deposited in this other site called Peckax Mountain, which is [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=915.1600000000001s)]
*  also quite close to Korn. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=922.7600000000001s)]
*  And I would think it's probably hidden there somewhere. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=925.0s)]
*  It's even deeper than Fordow, by the way. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=928.24s)]
*  But it's never mentioned because it seems to be off the radar. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=931.24s)]
*  Anyway, I think that is probably where it is. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=936.24s)]
*  But until the Iranians clear one of these entrances, I mean, which they deliberately [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=939.5600000000001s)]
*  blocked up to sort of stop pressure rising and go into the hole, we won't know how much [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=945.4000000000001s)]
*  damage is done. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=954.56s)]
*  But I think the Isfahan one also is very deep and it's quite likely that centrifuges [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=956.24s)]
*  were not destroyed at Isfahan. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=962.96s)]
*  Nantaz is different. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  Nantaz is very old. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=967.24s)]
*  It's there from the Shah's time. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=969.04s)]
*  It's mostly on the surface. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=971.16s)]
*  I remember passing it and you could, you know, it's there and you see it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=973.0s)]
*  But they put the centrifuges down, I think, between 60 and 80 meters. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=977.3199999999999s)]
*  So, I mean, maybe they're badly damaged. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=983.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=985.72s)]
*  But they don't need many centrifuges. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=987.52s)]
*  One of the things that this professor from MIT, Postel, Postel says that, you know, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=990.64s)]
*  once you get to a certain point in the enrichment process, then it becomes [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=996.4s)]
*  exponential. You just have to do a tiny bit more and that you're up at 90 percent. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1001.0s)]
*  So, I mean, you know, they don't need many centrifuges to survive. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1006.36s)]
*  The pilots talked about seeing explosions. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1012.52s)]
*  But what I heard, that was in fact not a good sign. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1017.6s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1022.04s)]
*  That is a sign that there was a blast bend on the vent. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1024.36s)]
*  And so the blast was coming up. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1029.48s)]
*  And that's why it had a spectacular view of explosion because it hadn't gone down to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1031.84s)]
*  the centrifuge floor. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1037.04s)]
*  It had come up and was at the surface. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1039.56s)]
*  So it isn't necessarily a good indicator of that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1042.12s)]
*  So that was really the gist of it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1047.32s)]
*  I think it was clear, you know, that Trump wanted it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1051.8s)]
*  And we know quite a lot about that day because someone, and I wrote about it, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1056.1999999999998s)]
*  in a sense, you and I'm sure you probably know Michael Wolfe, who's written four books on Trump. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1065.8s)]
*  And he was talking and calling. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1073.56s)]
*  You know, he works by calling interlocutors that Trump has just spoken to on the phone. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1076.2s)]
*  And he says it's a really reliable way of finding out what Trump is thinking because he says the same [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  question to each interlocutor. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1087.24s)]
*  And it's not really a question. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1089.6s)]
*  So on the 12th, it seemed that on the 22nd, rather the day of the American strike, Trump was quite anxious, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1091.32s)]
*  according to Michael Wolfe. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1100.76s)]
*  And he kept asking people, I mean, is it going to work? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1103.1599999999999s)]
*  Is it going to be a win? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1106.84s)]
*  Is it going to be, I mean, a game changer? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1108.12s)]
*  I'm hoping for a game changer. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1110.84s)]
*  We want something that is perfect. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1112.4399999999998s)]
*  And this will be, you know, a big headline and a big win. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1115.32s)]
*  And I want the headline. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1120.04s)]
*  We won. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1122.12s)]
*  And so he says there was, you know, an element of sort of lack of confidence almost in Trump. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he went on saying the same thing. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1132.36s)]
*  You know, this is what it's got to be. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1135.1599999999999s)]
*  In, boom, out. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1137.3999999999999s)]
*  In, boom, out, ceasefire. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1139.8s)]
*  And so that's how it was presented. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1143.0s)]
*  And actually, you know, this suits the Iranians quite well, because he says, you know, and insists, obliterated. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1147.08s)]
*  Everything has been obliterated. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1156.9199999999998s)]
*  There's nothing left. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1158.6s)]
*  It's all over. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1159.6399999999999s)]
*  No nuclear program. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1160.76s)]
*  Well, this is fine from the Iranian point of view, because they say, well, then to sort of Macron and others who say, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1162.52s)]
*  well, well, the IEA have to go back and sort of inspect and find out what's going on. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1170.6s)]
*  And they said, but it's you who say it's all over. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1176.52s)]
*  There isn't a program. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1179.08s)]
*  So why do we need the IEA in there at all? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1180.12s)]
*  In fact, the IEA are already out and they're returned. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1182.84s)]
*  I mean, I already am not exaggerating this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1188.12s)]
*  They need huge bodyguards if they ever went back to Iran. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1191.4s)]
*  They are hated with a huge intensity by the ordinary population, because they believe that particularly the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1195.16s)]
*  assassination of the scientists and the identification of them came from the IEA artificial intelligence program [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1204.92s)]
*  Mosaic, which is one of the, if you like, Palantir stable of targeting systems, which relies on imputing motives to people, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1215.88s)]
*  not on evidence. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1229.0800000000002s)]
*  This is where you get the great disparity with Talsi Gabbard, for example, because what the IEA were using was this data [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1230.44s)]
*  gathering process examining 400 million pieces of data, social, what you read on your social platforms, where you move, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1239.16s)]
*  who your children play with, all of those things, just like Palantir uses the same system in Israel and in Gaza to impute to Israel. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1249.3200000000002s)]
*  To Iran, the idea that they are not being honest in moving the enriched uranium, that they're not declaring things. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1261.32s)]
*  And so that's what happened on the 12th, the day before the Israeli attack on Iran. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1271.6399999999999s)]
*  The board of the IEA on the basis of this evidence said, oh, Iran is accelerating towards enrichment and therefore to a bomb. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1278.6799999999998s)]
*  And this is in breach of the protocols of the JCPOA. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1291.8s)]
*  This is really the pretext for the attack on Iran that took place on Friday the 13th of June. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1298.12s)]
*  That resolution that was prepared and stage managed effectively by the IEA to give, if you like, a peg for the Israeli [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1307.24s)]
*  attack to take place, which is why the Iranians and the Russians too are so distrustful of the IEA. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1319.64s)]
*  And I don't think it's going back into Iran. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1329.4s)]
*  Well, the UN inspection teams in Iraq were riddled with foreign intelligence operatives, including Israeli. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1333.5600000000002s)]
*  One has to assume that's also true with the IEA. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1340.76s)]
*  Oh, it's completely, I mean, it's not, I mean, it's verified. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1344.44s)]
*  I mean, we know that they were providing intelligence to the Mossad and to Israel about. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1349.48s)]
*  And of course, IEA insisted on meeting the scientists involved in the nuclear program and therefore being able to identify them. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1356.28s)]
*  Whether this was directly passed on, I can't say. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1366.6s)]
*  But the Iranians have intelligence which suggests that it was passed on. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1370.36s)]
*  I haven't seen the intelligence. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1375.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about the strikes on Israel. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1378.76s)]
*  Of course, because of military censorship in Israel, we don't know the full picture. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1380.84s)]
*  We know that refineries were hit in Haifa. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1385.64s)]
*  We know the Weizmann Institute was hit. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1388.1200000000001s)]
*  Reading it from a distance, it does appear that Israel was probably a little surprised [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1393.48s)]
*  at the extent of the damage that the Iranians were able to inflict. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1398.68s)]
*  Oh, I think they were very shocked by it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1403.96s)]
*  They had never been, they were attacked as they'd never been attacked before. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1408.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, they might have been used to a few Katusha rockets from Gaza, but this was a completely different order. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1412.68s)]
*  As you say, there's been a complete news blackout. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1420.92s)]
*  But subsequently, from satellite images, it's clear that at least five military sites [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1424.2s)]
*  were destroyed by the Iranians apart from, if you like, the main ones, which was the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1432.28s)]
*  Akiria, which was the equivalent of the Pentagon, the Mossad headquarters, and Herzliya, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1439.0s)]
*  and various other sites as well, as well as other damages. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1446.04s)]
*  And those other ones are very important because this is key in their economic sense that first of all, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1450.2s)]
*  there was the attack on Haifa and the destruction of the refinery at Haifa. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1459.0s)]
*  And that's been that the Israelis say will not be able to operate for at least a month. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1465.72s)]
*  And then there was the attack on the Ashdod port, which destroyed the electric power system. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1472.3600000000001s)]
*  There's the generators, the power generators there, which led to the blackout in about a third of the country. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1481.0800000000002s)]
*  There's been restored. But Israel has three ports, Elat, which has been closed for months, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1488.84s)]
*  Haifa and Ashdod. Both of those were heavily attacked. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1496.28s)]
*  And the economy was really at a halt. And this is why Israel called to the [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1502.84s)]
*  Omanis and said, we need a ceasefire and said the same to America, we need it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1509.08s)]
*  And the other reason was because they were running out of of missiles, or intercept missiles. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1513.64s)]
*  The Israelis themselves say 93 THAAD missiles were fired by the Americans and the Israelis [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1520.6000000000001s)]
*  in that period of the 12 days. 93, which is equivalent to 1.2 billion worth of missiles, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1529.24s)]
*  and which is about two to three years total production capacity of THAAD missile interceptors. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1537.16s)]
*  During that period. So again, you know, not only can that operation that they did on the 13th not [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1543.72s)]
*  be easily resurrected, but at the moment, Israel is going to have to wait to re equip itself with [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1550.3600000000001s)]
*  air defenses in a major way before they could think of attacking. Iran is doing the same. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1559.8000000000002s)]
*  The Iranians believe and think that there will be a further attack from Israel, because it's not [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1569.16s)]
*  they believe in Israel's interest to accept the Trump assertion that the program is over, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1579.16s)]
*  that Israel wants to say that the program is there because that provides them with the cue [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1588.6000000000001s)]
*  that to say, yes, within the ceasefire, we have the right to attack when and as we want on to Iran, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1596.76s)]
*  if we suspect that they're enriching or moving uranium, we can attack at our initiative. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1604.1200000000001s)]
*  This is what the basis of the ceasefire in Lebanon is that there is to be a ceasefire, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1612.2s)]
*  but Israeli has the right to attack anywhere in Lebanon as it chooses and when it chooses. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1618.76s)]
*  So they've been trying to impose the same terms, if you like, on Iran. And I think that is [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1625.8s)]
*  ultimately intended to try and pull in America to another round of attacks because Israeli position [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1632.36s)]
*  is still and this is very important, really, that the Israeli position is that simply the [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1641.6399999999999s)]
*  enrichment program cannot be defeated by military systems alone. The only way ultimately to defeat [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1652.1200000000001s)]
*  it is by a regime change and the imposition of a Western style puppet government into Tehran, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1659.72s)]
*  because they believe that they cannot kill the technical knowledge or the will to move ahead [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1671.4s)]
*  with enrichment. So I think it's pretty, if the West, I think there are two triggers [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1677.8799999999999s)]
*  that we should watch. If the West really pushes the Iranians to allow some sort of oversight or [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1685.3999999999999s)]
*  monitoring of the program with a reformed perhaps IAEA or whatever, by the way, Russia won't push [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1695.32s)]
*  them very hard on that because the IAEA, Russia has its own quarrels with the IAEA. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1706.28s)]
*  But if the West pushes, Trump pushes very hard on that, then I think, and it is required under the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1711.96s)]
*  NPT, the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, monitoring and accountability is part of the treaty. If that [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1720.52s)]
*  is pushed, then I think there will be an answer, which is we're leaving the NPT. And if then, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1730.36s)]
*  which is also likely, the Euro 3 and the JCPOA push for a snapback of sanctions on Iran, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1741.1599999999999s)]
*  and they've already said publicly that they intend to push for a snapback sanctions. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1751.8799999999999s)]
*  Part of the whole process of putting more pressure on Iran and then, you know, the hope that Trump [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1759.64s)]
*  keeps saying that they will then come and offer an unconditional surrender, which will never happen. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1766.6s)]
*  But that's the plan anyway. But those two things were likely to push Iran off the NPT. What happens [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1772.68s)]
*  then? We have to wait and see. But there is a very strong patriotic mood, as you referred to [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1780.04s)]
*  in the introduction. And what is so striking is it's the young, you know, the people that people [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1787.24s)]
*  thought were not necessarily, you know, supporters of it. And they are totally, totally supporting [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1795.56s)]
*  the Supreme Leader. He's like a sort of celebrity figure now for everyone, for the young and for [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1803.48s)]
*  all. So I don't know whether they will decide to move towards a weapon or leave it in sort of [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1812.52s)]
*  strategic ambiguity. That's a possibility too. Well, these kinds of attacks always [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1825.16s)]
*  generate that kind of blowback. I was in Buenos Aires right before the British attack, the Falklands, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1833.4s)]
*  and the regime was about to fall, the junta. And then as soon as the attack began, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1839.16s)]
*  these people became national galtiere and all these criminals became national heroes. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1843.88s)]
*  I want to talk about that process because the Supreme Leader has, I think it was 2003, had written [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1848.6000000000001s)]
*  that it was against Sharia Islamic law to build a nuclear weapon. That's perfectly true. But there [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1856.28s)]
*  is some important element. Under Sharia jurisprudence, there's a thing called Ijtihad, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1867.8s)]
*  which is that you can change law through reasoning, through a process of reasoning. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1874.6s)]
*  And that reasoning can be changed on the basis of time and circumstances. So that if it's no longer [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1883.72s)]
*  appropriate because the world has moved on and life is different, or because of a change in [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1893.16s)]
*  circumstances, then a jurist, it has to be a jurist. It's not a political decision, but a qualified [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1899.88s)]
*  jurist, Hodget al-Islam or Morsignor, can actually change the law and a new fatwa can be issued [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1907.0s)]
*  very easily. It doesn't need parliamentary or a few, but there is a majority in Iran now [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1916.52s)]
*  of people who argue that it was a mistake never to go down this route. And that this is going to be [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1924.76s)]
*  something that is going to be really much more. And this is something the Russians have alluded to, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1934.52s)]
*  which I think is quite significant. They're saying actually this whole proliferation process [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1939.88s)]
*  that the West had is actually back to front because actually it's pushing people ultimately [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1945.96s)]
*  towards a weapon, not preventing them because this process of going around and just threatening [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1952.6000000000001s)]
*  states were going to bomb you to the stone age if you don't do what we tell you, actually has ended. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1959.24s)]
*  And that's what happened, of course, with North Korea. I mean, they'd agreed a process of giving [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1967.4s)]
*  it up, but then more requirements and more requirements were imposed. I mean, it was all [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1973.16s)]
*  agreed and there was going to be money put in and a new process. And then the extra demands [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1978.44s)]
*  that Washington imposed on top of the original agreement prompted the North Koreans to say, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1986.1200000000001s)]
*  oh, hang it. It's not worth it. I mean, it's much better than we should go for a bomb. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1992.6s)]
*  So, I mean, the Russians and others are saying, well, you know, this whole nonproliferation, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=1998.36s)]
*  actually the real proliferators at this moment is the West because they keep pushing people [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2005.1599999999999s)]
*  towards thinking the only thing that they need. And look what's happened. They bombed Iran and [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2011.08s)]
*  now Saudi Arabia is talking about a weapon. Now India is expressing concerns about it and what [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2019.4s)]
*  the consequences will be. Other states will be pursuing it. So actually, rather than stopping [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2025.8000000000002s)]
*  proliferation, acting to stop proliferation as the West says it's doing, it is actually encouraging [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2031.96s)]
*  proliferation. That's the Russian view. Medvedev said that, the vice president said that quite [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2040.8400000000001s)]
*  recently. We also have the example of Gaddafi who gave up his program. Exactly. Exactly. It [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2048.6s)]
*  wasn't too difficult to take away, I remember, because it was still in its packing cases. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2058.12s)]
*  He hadn't even unpacked it and it was removed. Anyway, that was, yes, there isn't a good history [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2063.48s)]
*  by it. Let's talk about the increased drone activity that apparently is occurring over Iran [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2069.72s)]
*  and what that means. The Israeli drone activity over Iran at the moment is not attack drones. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2076.04s)]
*  It is mostly surveillance drones. They're trying to scope out radar and the time it takes for radar [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2086.6s)]
*  to lock onto them and where the radar is. And that is being fed into the American, only the Americans [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2096.6s)]
*  have this sort of satellite-based battlescape map that sort of tracks all radar and air defenses so [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2104.2s)]
*  that you can, if you like, construct your missiles to sort of do a slalom between all the impediments [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2113.56s)]
*  to reach your target. So that's what's happening at the moment. Plus, and I heard this from Tehran [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2122.68s)]
*  just yesterday, they're under huge cyber attack from all NATO, they say. I mean, there's a big [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2132.76s)]
*  cyber attacks going. So I think both parties expect there will be another round and Iran's, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2140.28s)]
*  certainly, and Israel is preparing for the next stage. So I think, although Trump, and I don't [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2150.0400000000004s)]
*  think he wanted this, I mean, from everything that Michael Wolff said about those calls, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2160.6s)]
*  which were, you know, I just want this to be perfect. I want this, you know, I want this to be [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2166.92s)]
*  in boom, out, finished, ceasefire, done. Let's close it and finish this talk. I think that what [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2172.84s)]
*  Trump is trying to do there is he does not, and Michael Wolff says, and I think this is absolutely [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2181.32s)]
*  right. He doesn't think he has the attention span to do a long, drawn out slugfest fight with Iran. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2187.88s)]
*  What he's trying to do is shut it down to give him enough space to get back to what really wants, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2196.76s)]
*  which is, if you like, this new Middle East business world, this new structure whereby [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2204.52s)]
*  Lebanon and Syria and others will be brought into some form, we will have the Abraham Accords 2.0, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2211.48s)]
*  and that through this will open a universe of business and trading possibilities through, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2222.12s)]
*  and, you know, that he hopes that Iran can just sort of stand on the sidelines and not do anything [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2230.44s)]
*  about it until he can find some other agreement with Iran. But the main thing is the headline. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2238.04s)]
*  Let's have a big headline. We've done it. There's a new Middle East. Everyone's in this new sort of [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2243.64s)]
*  matrix of money, investments, resources, and of course the resources of Iran, which are so vital [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2251.56s)]
*  to China, and also the fact that the Gulf states and that if he can take that whole, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2261.56s)]
*  if you like, corridor of the Middle East, he can take it into southern Central Asia and disrupt [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2269.32s)]
*  the BRICS and their connectivity plans in those stun areas, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, all those [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2277.96s)]
*  areas. He can disrupt it and start moving the economic sphere into this at the same time that [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2288.92s)]
*  he's doing, if you like, an attempt to cage China literally by tariff structures and also weakening [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2296.6800000000003s)]
*  Russia by reigniting the tensions in the Caucasus again. And so Russia and Putin is taking this very [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2307.96s)]
*  seriously, and so is China, and they are very angry about this. They're angry about the deceit because [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2319.64s)]
*  Putin thinks he was deceived by those attacks on the strategic bombers just the day before the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2329.0s)]
*  Istanbul talks, just as Iran is. And China believes also that Xi was cheated by Trump [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2336.36s)]
*  in the discussions that they had. So there's a real sort of sense of preparing for a new and wider [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2348.84s)]
*  cold war that is being pushed. I mean, Kazakhstan in the north, that is, I was in Russia around [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2357.7999999999997s)]
*  about the time of the Krokus Hall, the concert hall that was burnt down. And they were Tajiks [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2372.68s)]
*  that had come down who were found to be responsible. And there was a big structure [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2382.12s)]
*  in Kazakhstan for recruiting people, Afghans and Tajiks and others, and for infiltrating them into [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2388.68s)]
*  to Russia or to Iran or whatever. And now we see that Azerbaijan is engaged in the same idea. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2397.64s)]
*  Now, the reports, I can't verify them, but recently Russia arrested a number of [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2406.6s)]
*  Azeris Russian citizens, and that produced a dramatic response from Aliyev, who arrested [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2415.56s)]
*  all the Sputnik journalists and many others in Azerbaijan. And they roughed them up, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2423.7999999999997s)]
*  and they've charged them with espionage and other charges. Now, there's always been a sort [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2431.2400000000002s)]
*  of criminal groups in Russia or from Azerbaijan. They're known as sort of a mafia there. But this [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2439.0s)]
*  is more serious, I believe, because it's thinking the Russians may be suspecting that these groups [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2448.84s)]
*  were also facilitating the infiltration of some of those pre-positioned units that were ready for [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2455.48s)]
*  the attack on the strategic bomber system in Russia. The spiders were. And that also Azerbaijan [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2465.32s)]
*  was facilitating the attack on Iran. So Azerbaijan and Armenia too, and the question of Turkey's role. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2477.64s)]
*  The United States is trying to woo Erdogan with promises of F-35s, if only Hill-Mothball, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2487.7999999999997s)]
*  the S-400s that he has. And I think that the aim is, the Israeli aim is the key to their, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2497.48s)]
*  if you like, their new corridor, the new, if you like, Abraham Accord 2.0, a business plan right [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2509.32s)]
*  through to Asia, is that Turkey should persuade both Syria and Lebanon that they have no choice [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2519.24s)]
*  and incentivize them both to join into this new sort of greater Israel project. So this is why [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2531.24s)]
*  there's a lot of tensions that all these proposals that are coming out of America at the moment, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2540.52s)]
*  the intent to sort of cut off China from trade by putting differential tariffs on China, if they [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2547.56s)]
*  trans ship goods through Vietnam or another country, the prospect of new sanctions on Russia, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2558.12s)]
*  the attack on Iran is a pivot, a key pivot for Russia and China of the whole brick structure. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2566.92s)]
*  All of these things producing a really strong response from Russia. I mean, it's giving, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2576.7599999999998s)]
*  it's given very tough response to Trump and this and says, we know exactly what you're doing in the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2585.4s)]
*  Caucasus. We know what you are doing in Azerbaijan, and we won't put up with it. And so Russia [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2592.12s)]
*  responded to this by destroying the two refineries in Ukraine that were fueled from Baku, from [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2601.08s)]
*  Azerbaijan. There was Azerbaijan input that was fueling these two refineries. This was a [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2612.3599999999997s)]
*  warning to Azerbaijan, you know, stop playing around with this. So Iran will be saying something [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2619.64s)]
*  rather similar, I suspect, to the Azeris. Now, I think some people in the United States think, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2629.16s)]
*  even dream of the idea that Azerbaijan could invade at the right moment in coordination with [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2638.68s)]
*  Israel into Iran as the Baluch perhaps come from another side or the Kurds from the other. But I [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2646.6s)]
*  think that is very far fetched because 85% of Azeris are Shi. There is, if you like, the leadership [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2654.6s)]
*  is Turkic more than Iranian Shi, but they're Turkic, either Sunni or Shi converted. Anyway, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2665.3199999999997s)]
*  it's very secular. And the, you know, the Iranians, all the Azeris in Iran are very, very loyal to [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2672.44s)]
*  Iran. And, you know, people talk about, you know, well, the Azeris glass ceiling. And I slightly laugh [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2682.52s)]
*  at that. And I say, well, there's one person you've probably heard of, who's a really well-known poet, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2689.48s)]
*  and he writes in the Azeri language. And he's fluent in the Azeri language. And he is Azeri, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2696.28s)]
*  and that's a supreme leader. So it's not that the Azeris are completely sort of outliers in Iran. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2703.4s)]
*  Isn't that, didn't Israel launch drones from there? Isn't that a point? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2711.1600000000003s)]
*  Exactly. They launched drones. And also, as I say, the airspace of Azerbaijan was used for standoff [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2715.48s)]
*  firing of drones that had these new cruise missiles, multiple cruise missiles. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2727.8s)]
*  They could launch them once they were in Iranian territory. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2735.56s)]
*  I have two last questions, but just on Gaza, because in the meeting in the White House, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2739.16s)]
*  when reporters were allowed in, Trump and Netanyahu were talking about depopulating Gaza. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2748.12s)]
*  Netanyahu very cynically said, it's not a prison. People who want to leave, of course, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2755.72s)]
*  there's enforced starvation since March 2nd, should have the right to leave. Just your thoughts on [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2761.3199999999997s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza? What's happening in Gaza is that [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2769.48s)]
*  Netanyahu and the right are intent on, first of all, pushing all the Palestinians into what [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2778.12s)]
*  amounts to a concentration camp in one small part. They will be put in, but they will not be [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2785.64s)]
*  allowed out of it. And it is a stage towards, it's politely called voluntary expatriation, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2793.72s)]
*  but it is, of course, mandatory, if you like, removal of the population from Gaza. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2802.4399999999996s)]
*  The same is going on in the West Bank. Huge process. Smotrich is in charge of this aspect. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2813.24s)]
*  And there is a real effort being made because they think they believe they can persuade Trump [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2821.56s)]
*  to annex most of the West Bank. But settlers have moved in into large areas. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2830.52s)]
*  New settlements are announced all the time. It is the annexation is afoot in the West Bank, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2837.4s)]
*  as in Gaza. And I think I remember Smotrich was always very, very clear about this. I remember [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2846.04s)]
*  listening to him about six years ago or so. And he said, listen, listen, this is our plan, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2855.0s)]
*  to remove all the Palestinians from the area. And he said, but as it is with the legal system, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2861.88s)]
*  it's difficult. What we need is a big crisis or a big war. And when that happens, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2870.7599999999998s)]
*  we will complete the project. That's what we're looking for. And that's why they're always sort [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2878.12s)]
*  of playing around with the Temple Mount, Al-Aqsa. Looking to use that perhaps as the pretext to sort [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2884.12s)]
*  of trigger a commotion in the whole Muslim world. Al-Aqsa is a neurologic point in the Muslim world [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2891.96s)]
*  that they could use us as the ability to sort of create the crisis that they could then, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2904.68s)]
*  under the pretext of an emergency, really move, finish off the depopulation of Gaza [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2910.52s)]
*  and also much of the West Bank. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2918.7599999999998s)]
*  But does that mean they would try and drive them into Jordan and they would drive the Palestinians [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2921.16s)]
*  and Gaza into Egypt? The Egyptians and the Jordanians have been adamant that's not going to happen. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2927.48s)]
*  Yes. But they are pushing them closer and closer to the Rafale Gate. And what's going to happen [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2933.24s)]
*  if they open those gates and just push them out? You know, a million or so Palestinians. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2942.04s)]
*  It's very, very sensitive in Egypt. The Egyptians are really ordinary Egyptians. The Egyptian army [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2949.64s)]
*  is very angry with Sisi about his ineffectual response to what's happening in Gaza. It could [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2957.08s)]
*  explode. The whole Egyptian element could explode in this process. Of course, there'll be some sort [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2964.2s)]
*  of public relations exercise of sending a few Palestinians to, I don't know where, but somewhere [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2973.72s)]
*  to say, oh no, they went voluntarily. But of course, that's not what's planned. What's planned [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2979.4s)]
*  is another Nakba from Gaza. And it's unfolding, sadly, unfortunately. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=2986.2s)]
*  Hamas demands are not met by this proposal. This is why I think what we will get is probably some [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3003.8799999999997s)]
*  sort of ceasefire. But it's a ceasefire designed to allow the Israelis to resume the attrition of [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3012.52s)]
*  Gaza, either because they'll claim it breaking down or because they'll claim the 60 days are over. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3020.44s)]
*  And the Hamas position remains unchanged. We want an end to the war. We want the removal of all of [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3029.8s)]
*  the Israeli troops from Gaza and a reconstruction of the strip. And of course, the Witkoff proposal [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3038.84s)]
*  does none of those things. It doesn't provide for an end of the war. There will still be Israeli [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3047.88s)]
*  forces inside Gaza during the ceasefire and after. And the proposals for reconstructing it is quite [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3052.6000000000004s)]
*  different to be done by client Arab states. We should just draw that parallel between [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3062.12s)]
*  decapitating Hamas. I knew Abdul Aziz Rantisi, one of the co-founders of Hamas, assassinated with his [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3069.72s)]
*  son in 2004, a long litany of Hamas leaders who were killed. And of course, it disrupts the [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3075.88s)]
*  organization without question. But just because Israel has decapitated Iranian leadership, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3088.76s)]
*  ultimately, I mean, I'll get your feet on this, but it ultimately doesn't disrupt the system. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3095.8s)]
*  I think that's exactly what we saw in Iran. I mean, you know, that actually, as so often has happened, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3105.0s)]
*  Israel decapitates the moderates and the younger generation that come in are much more hardline [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3112.36s)]
*  than, you know, they're rather elderly. I mean, some of the IRGC, you know, are veterans from [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3120.28s)]
*  the Iran-Iraq war and, you know, the younger are much more vigorous and much more determined [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3126.04s)]
*  than the older ones. And that's what's happened. And I don't think, you know, I don't think, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3136.36s)]
*  I think what we've seen is the other part of this great equation that was supposed to come out of [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3143.1600000000003s)]
*  Washington. As Boehler said categorically, they will not accept any process that leads to their [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3148.52s)]
*  disarmament. Now, this may end up in civil war in Lebanon. It could do. It's very, it would, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3156.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, what the Americans are pushing very, very hard in every way to disenfranchise, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3162.2s)]
*  depoliticise, demilitarise the Shia who are the majority in Lebanon. And they, it won't happen. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3169.08s)]
*  I mean, they've been down that route in the past, as you know, and it's not likely to happen. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3180.04s)]
*  Let's just close with the next Israeli strike. I mean, which, you know, you talked about how [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3186.2s)]
*  Israel views ceasefires. This is writ large in Gaza, where Israel violates every single ceasefire [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3195.48s)]
*  they make to quote unquote, mow the lawn. That same kind of mentality will most likely [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3202.9199999999996s)]
*  be used to again make strikes against Iran if in Israeli eyes, they feel they are [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3210.04s)]
*  reconstituting military defences or a nuclear programme. What's, what do you, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3217.08s)]
*  how do you picture that strike and the consequences? The next one. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3224.84s)]
*  I think the first thing which is really important to say is that, and you know, we follow the Israeli [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3231.32s)]
*  press very, very closely, the Hebrew press, I mean, not just the English language press. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3238.92s)]
*  It's very clear that they know now after what has happened, I mean, they sustain much more damage [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3246.44s)]
*  than they had expected, that they cannot attack Iran without full un-stinting American support. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3254.6800000000003s)]
*  Now the question is, is that going to be forthcoming? And I think one of the things that [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3263.88s)]
*  I feel might stop it is the question of the MAGA. I think the MAGA are really quite unhappy. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3270.76s)]
*  You know, there were two issues in the American election, immigration and forever wars. And MAGA [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3282.2s)]
*  you know, came and also there is a quite a number of Democrats, young Democratic voters, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3290.04s)]
*  who supported Trump mainly because he promised peace and no more war. Not necessarily for the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3297.08s)]
*  other part, but certainly for that. They are starting to filter away. And it's also in the [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3304.12s)]
*  MAGA, you've seen, I mean, Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and everyone who, there's a big pushback [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3311.88s)]
*  against it. They have, Trump has a majority, I think you can correct me if I'm wrong, about three [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3320.04s)]
*  in both houses, in the Senate and the House. It's small and midterms are just over a year away. So [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3326.6800000000003s)]
*  I think he is going to be worried about the internal position, the MAGA position and that. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3336.52s)]
*  And that was obvious almost when Hexess came in, spoke and he said, he went on, you may remember [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3343.72s)]
*  it, he made a statement, I think on Fox News saying, look, we're not attacking Iran per se, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3349.8s)]
*  or the Iranian people, we're just attacking the nuclear program. I think, you know, we're not [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3354.84s)]
*  wanting to have a war with Iran, we're just trying to sort this part out. So I think he will, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3362.12s)]
*  because, you know, with only three, it would be quite feasible if he gets stuck and locked into a [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3369.0s)]
*  long bloody conflict in Iran. And it would be because Iran's got surprises for the United States, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3377.24s)]
*  and for Israel, if it moves to another phase, everyone is preparing for another phase. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3387.0s)]
*  If it does that, you know, he may find that, you know, at the end of it, I mean, it will be a very [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3395.4s)]
*  different world. I mean, one can't even rule out if there is a change at the midterm elections, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3401.4s)]
*  you know, impeachment and things might come back onto the agenda. Well, you know more about that [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3406.44s)]
*  than I, but it's a generous moment. And I think he's right to be concerned about it, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3411.64s)]
*  because it's from both ends of his, it's the young and it is the MAGA who both, you know, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3417.48s)]
*  don't want a war, a big war in the Middle East, particularly. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3424.68s)]
*  Great. Thanks. And I want to thank Sophia, Victor, Max, Thomas, and Diego, who produced the show. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO3jNWfyWNI&t=3431.24s)]
