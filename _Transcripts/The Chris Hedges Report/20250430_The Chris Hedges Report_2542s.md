# The West Serves as Israel's Police (w/ Richard Medhurst) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M)
*  Richard Medhurst is a journalist from the United Kingdom known for his coverage on international [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=0.0s)]
*  relations and the Middle East. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=15.76s)]
*  Having spent many years reporting on the persecution of Julian Assange, he now faces his own legal [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=18.04s)]
*  battle in Britain due to his reporting. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=24.3s)]
*  He is accused not of espionage but of another political crime nonetheless, terrorism. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=27.36s)]
*  In August 2024, counter-terrorism police boarded Medhurst's flight as he landed in Heathrow [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=33.84s)]
*  and arrested him under the Terrorism Act. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=40.12s)]
*  This marked the first time in Britain that a journalist had been arrested under Section [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=43.76s)]
*  12-1A, a provision so broad it effectively criminalizes the press or anyone who speaks [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  uncomfortable truths. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=55.54s)]
*  Since releasing him on bail, the police have kept Medhurst under investigation for almost [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=57.78s)]
*  nine months, extending the process every quarter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=62.9s)]
*  This can potentially go on for years, keeping a person in a state of limbo and uncertainty [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=67.1s)]
*  about their future. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=72.3s)]
*  Medhurst was also asked to unlock his phones by the police. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=74.7s)]
*  He has refused to do so in order to protect confidential sources and information. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=78.78s)]
*  However, if the police obtain a court order, refusal to comply under RIPA, another press [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=84.26s)]
*  of law, can result in an automatic prison sentence of two to five years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=90.22s)]
*  In February, he was told by the UK that the investigation was being extended yet again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=95.3s)]
*  Then, within a week, Medhurst was suddenly summoned by immigration authorities in Austria [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=100.98s)]
*  to what turned out to be a trap. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=106.86s)]
*  He was first issued a thinly veiled threat that his residency might be revoked because [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=109.1s)]
*  of his work. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=114.41999999999999s)]
*  Then agents belonging to the Austrian security services ambushed him with a warrant, detained [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=115.94s)]
*  him and raided both his home and studio, seizing all his electronic devices. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  The raid was ordered by the Vienna State Prosecutor, who accuses Medhurst, who is Christian, of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  being a member of Hamas's military wing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  Medhurst is now under investigation in both countries, for no other reason than his reporting [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=139.22s)]
*  on Palestine and Lebanon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=144.74s)]
*  His criticism of Israel's genocide in Gaza has made him a target of two governments, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=147.06s)]
*  if not more. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=152.62s)]
*  If charged and convicted, he could potentially face up to 14 years imprisonment in the UK [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=153.62s)]
*  and or another 10 years in Austria. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=160.42s)]
*  Before United Nations special rapporteurs have written to British Prime Minister Keir [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=163.34s)]
*  Stammer in protest of this abuse of counter-terrorism laws, not just against Medhurst, but the crackdown [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=167.94s)]
*  that ensued following his arrest against dissident voices such as Craig Murray and Kit Clarenburg [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=175.46s)]
*  and others. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=181.86s)]
*  The International Federation of Journalists, the IFJ and the National Union of Journalists, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=183.06s)]
*  and UJ have also protested to the government and counter-terrorism command at what has [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=188.42s)]
*  happened to Medhurst. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=193.94s)]
*  Joining me to discuss this growing assault on journalism is Richard Medhurst. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=196.54s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about your reporting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=205.77999999999997s)]
*  And I have this printout from the Israeli Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=208.82s)]
*  Anti-Semitism of which you are singled out along with Jeremy Corbyn of all people and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=217.9s)]
*  Roger Waters from Pink Floyd. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=226.46s)]
*  And I found what they call the documentation of your support for terrorism just so absurd, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=229.74s)]
*  it's laughable. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=241.02s)]
*  They have screenshots, for instance, and they must have taken this from something that you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=242.02s)]
*  sent out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=247.7s)]
*  And you write, funny how Al-Qaeda and ISIS haven't lifted a finger to help the Palestinians. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=249.61999999999998s)]
*  It's almost as if they work with Israel and America, not against them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=255.22s)]
*  Well, I covered Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and Al-Qaeda has long had an animosity to Hamas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=258.82s)]
*  They consider Hamas to be apostates. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=265.78s)]
*  They would never have left a finger to help Hamas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=268.26s)]
*  That's just a factual statement. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=272.14s)]
*  So I want to talk a little bit about what it is, the kinds of things that you reported. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=275.22s)]
*  I've, of course, watched your show and done events with you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  And why you think it has triggered such a vicious response on the part of Israel and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=286.62s)]
*  then their surrogates in the UK and Austria. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=293.26000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Chris. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I laughed when I saw that document, first of all, because I was in shock at the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=299.38000000000005s)]
*  examples they picked too, because I mean, this term antisemitism is used, as we all [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=304.5s)]
*  know, to silence and stifle criticism of Zionism, which is a European colonial movement. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=309.86s)]
*  And they're, of course, labeling us all antisemites so they can smear us, so they can attack our [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=320.94s)]
*  reputations and try to paint us being a bunch of racists. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=327.02s)]
*  And those examples that they picked, I mean, just to further prove my point, look at what [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=330.06s)]
*  happened in Syria in the last couple of months with the ouster of Al-Assad and then the takeover [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=336.26s)]
*  of Jolani, who headed not just units of ISIS, but also Al-Qaeda. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=342.38s)]
*  He was a commander in both. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=348.98s)]
*  And while Israel was bombing Damascus afterwards, Jolani and his crowd didn't lift a finger. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=351.42s)]
*  They never attacked the Israelis, even when Israel is directly bombing their country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=358.66s)]
*  So it just raises a bunch of questions, doesn't it? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=364.8s)]
*  And we have those pictures, of course, of Netanyahu shaking hands with wounded so-called [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=368.22s)]
*  Syrian rebels who are actually better described as being Al-Qaeda, you know, taken to these [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=373.48s)]
*  IDF field hospitals. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=380.1s)]
*  The Israelis were treating them, giving them medical assistance, if not military assistance [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=381.98s)]
*  and intelligence. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=385.22s)]
*  So these are documented facts. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=386.7s)]
*  And like you said, they're at odds with the Palestinians. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=389.53999999999996s)]
*  So I just pointed out some facts. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=394.42s)]
*  And I don't know why they picked these tweets in particular, but I think it's my coverage [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  in general of Zionism and what's happening in Palestine and in Lebanon and in Syria that's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  angered them a lot. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=406.86s)]
*  Let's talk about, you would run, I think, videos that were posted by the resistance [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=410.86s)]
*  and comment on them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=417.14s)]
*  I'm wondering if, I mean, that's fair journalism, by the way, but I'm wondering if that is, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=419.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, do you have any idea why, you know, you've now been named, I mean, they've devoted, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=425.22s)]
*  of course, a whole page to you here, along with the other criminals like Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=432.14s)]
*  Do you have any idea, can you take any guesses as to why? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  You're an Arabic speaker too, we should be clear. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=440.5s)]
*  Is there, I mean, you know, obviously they start with you and they come for everyone [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=442.94s)]
*  else. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=448.46s)]
*  But do you have any idea why in particular, maybe it was just that you had a very broad [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=449.46s)]
*  reach? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=453.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=454.22s)]
*  Have you thought about that? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=455.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they've cited various examples. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=456.22s)]
*  I can't go into detail about what exactly they said at this stage, but I'm talking now [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=459.06s)]
*  just broadly about both Austria and the UK. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=463.98s)]
*  So I said, you know, they questioned me for two hours in the UK and they brought up various [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=467.78s)]
*  things and it was all to do with my reporting on Palestine, Lebanon, there was nothing, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=474.26s)]
*  nothing else in the entire world. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=479.09999999999997s)]
*  And the same thing in Austria. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=481.73999999999995s)]
*  And I mean, I posted this on Twitter. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  One of the examples that the Vienna State Prosecutor cited, it's actually the first [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=485.61999999999995s)]
*  one, is that I allegedly showed a video of Hamas eating triangle shaped dessert. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=490.58s)]
*  So you know, I think, I mean, I just, I don't know what to say, honestly, like, I'm kind [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=498.78s)]
*  of stunned and I was stunned from the moment they started reading this warrant to me, because [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=504.14s)]
*  in the very beginning, they're saying you're a member of Hamas and specifically the military [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=506.97999999999996s)]
*  wing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=510.82s)]
*  So they're basically saying I'm a gunman. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=511.82s)]
*  It's just, I tried to explain to them, they don't allow Christians in Hamas, it's just [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  not possible for me to be in that group. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=517.8199999999999s)]
*  I've never even been to Palestine before. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=520.78s)]
*  If I tried to go there, I wouldn't be allowed in by the Israelis, right? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=523.42s)]
*  So it's just, they, you know, they said they're following orders. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=526.86s)]
*  It didn't make any difference. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=531.5799999999999s)]
*  I tried explaining all these things to them, but I was shocked that a prosecutor can type [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=532.5799999999999s)]
*  these things out and think them up and type them out and act on them and have, you know, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=536.62s)]
*  agents, these are not just regular police, these were like MI5, they told me they're [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=541.78s)]
*  the equivalent of MI5. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=546.64s)]
*  Those are their words. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=548.2s)]
*  They came and took all my stuff. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  They were in this room right here, you know, and they went through all my things and took [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=551.16s)]
*  photographs of my rooms and the whole place, you know, they even took stuff that doesn't [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=555.2s)]
*  belong to me. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=558.76s)]
*  So I'm just, I'm still kind of in shock that you can make up a fantasy like that and just, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=559.88s)]
*  you know, attack someone based off of lies, based off of things that make no sense. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=565.16s)]
*  Well when you landed at Heathrow, if I have this right, you were detained on the plane, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=572.04s)]
*  right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=577.72s)]
*  I mean, they didn't, the plane landed and wasn't allowed to go to the gate because didn't [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=578.72s)]
*  they come and take you physically off the plane? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=582.8s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=585.2s)]
*  Yeah, they boarded the plane. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=586.2s)]
*  But before the passengers disembarked? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=588.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=592.92s)]
*  Yeah, they wouldn't let anyone disembark. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=593.92s)]
*  They called me to the front of the plane and I knew something wrong was happening because [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=595.52s)]
*  the plane just wasn't moving for a bit. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  And I started to think, okay, this is, this is finally it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=603.38s)]
*  They're going to nick me now because of, you know, my work. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=607.38s)]
*  Even though I haven't done anything wrong, but because I know that other people have [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  been persecuted under the terrorism act, you know, David Miranda, Glenn Grimald's husband, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=612.66s)]
*  Craig Murray, it's happened to so many people. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=620.86s)]
*  And so I thought this is probably it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=623.26s)]
*  And then they called me to the front of the plane and yeah, they, two agents got on the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=624.9s)]
*  flight and they took my bags and then they immediately, they didn't detain me. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=629.54s)]
*  They arrested me. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=636.8199999999999s)]
*  They officially arrested me. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=637.8199999999999s)]
*  And yeah, there was, I think one of them was in the tactical gear as well, you know, like [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=640.54s)]
*  proper counterterrorism response, which is just so wild, you know, that they send six [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=648.3399999999999s)]
*  people to begin with. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=654.02s)]
*  And then one of them is like an armed counterterrorism commander. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=655.02s)]
*  I mean, I just, what a waste of resources, you know, to put it mildly. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=657.9s)]
*  So what do you think, what do you think it's just part of the concerted campaign, which [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=664.38s)]
*  is of course being accelerated to shut down anyone who speaks up on behalf of Palestine [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=669.14s)]
*  and they're just beginning to pick off, you know, people like you for, I mean, what do [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=674.54s)]
*  you, what do you see this as presaging? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=681.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the police in both countries in the UK and Austria, they commented on how [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=686.0600000000001s)]
*  many followers I had in my reach. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=690.94s)]
*  So they made a point to, they made a point about it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=692.74s)]
*  They said like, you have a large amount of subscribers and you know, they were showing [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=696.22s)]
*  me like screenshots of my YouTube page and commenting on the number and it was in the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  warrant, in the Austrian warrant. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=705.26s)]
*  They also wrote down the number of followers I had on every page. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=706.82s)]
*  So they were trying to make a point that, you know, I'm supposedly a menace or something, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=709.88s)]
*  you know, and I think again, I'm guessing, but I think there's more to, so there's more [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=715.2s)]
*  to what they're letting on, you know, there's things, for example, my coverage of Julian's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=723.24s)]
*  case, I mean, which you also covered, we were in court together. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=727.72s)]
*  I think that might have bothered them as well. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=730.56s)]
*  I think it's also my coverage of the NATO war in Ukraine, the Russia-Ukraine war. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=733.76s)]
*  I think it's all of these things. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=741.84s)]
*  And I think also the fact that I covered Syria critically, you know, I pointed out the fact [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  that the Israelis are involved, America's involved, Britain is involved. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=748.2s)]
*  It's a regime change operation. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=752.08s)]
*  I think all of these things must have angered them. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=753.08s)]
*  And you know, I wasn't trying to anger anyone. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=756.4s)]
*  I was just trying to tell the truth as best as I could, you know, with the facts that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=759.12s)]
*  we had at that time. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=762.16s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  And I think they're trying to make an example out of me, definitely. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=764.9599999999999s)]
*  And I was already stunned when this happened in the UK, but when they came after me in [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=767.4399999999999s)]
*  Austria, I thought, yeah, they really have it in for me. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=771.28s)]
*  There's something not normal about this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=774.36s)]
*  And I'm shocked that you can even go after someone legally for the same thing in two [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  countries in two jurisdictions. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  It just, I mean, I know double jeopardy applies usually to being tried and convicted. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=783.16s)]
*  I haven't been charged with a crime in any country, thankfully. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=788.48s)]
*  But nevertheless, you know, my rights are being limited. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=792.5200000000001s)]
*  My equipment has been taken away. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=794.9000000000001s)]
*  Both in the UK and Austria, they took away my journalistic tools. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=797.5200000000001s)]
*  It wasn't just my phone and my laptop, which I also use for work, which are my work tools, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  but microphones. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  They took, you know, hard drive adapters, things that don't even have data on them, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=805.4000000000001s)]
*  analog microphones. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=809.88s)]
*  Like, why would you do that to someone unless you're trying to make a point that you don't [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=810.88s)]
*  want them to continue their work? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=813.7s)]
*  My understanding is that, and I mentioned Kit and Craig, but your situation, I think, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=818.32s)]
*  is worse than theirs. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=825.32s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=826.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean, Craig, of course, was tossed in jail. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=827.7600000000001s)]
*  And Kit wasn't expelled, was he, from the UK? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=833.5600000000001s)]
*  Was that correct? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=837.48s)]
*  But I think yours is more severe, your case. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=839.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=842.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're my colleagues and my friends. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=843.32s)]
*  And what happens to them, I consider as an affront on all of us, especially, you know, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=846.9200000000001s)]
*  members of the press. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=852.08s)]
*  I think what happened to me is perhaps a bit more escalatory because they didn't just detain [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=854.9200000000001s)]
*  me like they've done to everybody else using Schedule 7. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  They went with this Schedule 12, 1A, which has never been used before, and escalated [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=863.44s)]
*  it straight to an arrest. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=867.84s)]
*  So they booked me. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=869.44s)]
*  They took my fingerprints, my DNA. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=870.6s)]
*  They put me in jail for 24 hours. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=872.46s)]
*  And you know, keep in mind, this was in the UK. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=875.38s)]
*  This is in the UK, yeah. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  So I was arrested at 6.30 p.m. and I wasn't questioned until 2 p.m. the next day. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=881.72s)]
*  I have no idea what they wanted. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=886.5400000000001s)]
*  And that might have been part of kind of just trying to rattle someone, but it's definitely [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=888.46s)]
*  escalatory to keep me in jail for the full 24 hours and then put me under investigation, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=892.32s)]
*  release me on bail. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=899.5400000000001s)]
*  In Austria, they didn't arrest me, but they detained me and they took my fingerprints [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=901.98s)]
*  as well and they took my DNA as well and mugshots, everything. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=906.6999999999999s)]
*  It's very dehumanizing. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=909.5s)]
*  So yeah, in both jurisdictions, it's certainly an escalation. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=911.26s)]
*  And I think that was when the crackdown began. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=915.38s)]
*  So after me, they went for Richard Barnard of Palestine Action. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=918.3s)]
*  They charged him with 12, 1A. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=921.78s)]
*  Then they went after Sarah Wilkinson. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=923.54s)]
*  They raided her house. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=925.1s)]
*  And then I think it went after Asa Winstanley's devices. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=926.74s)]
*  So it was very, very, very clear that a crackdown had begun with my arrest. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=930.14s)]
*  Do you have any idea what the timing? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=937.98s)]
*  Do you think something triggered it or not? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=940.38s)]
*  I think it's because labor came to power. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=944.9s)]
*  So I was arrested in August and they won the election in June, July. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=947.86s)]
*  You and I were in England for Craig campaign in June. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=952.18s)]
*  So that was the last time I was in the UK in peace. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=956.22s)]
*  And then when I came back the next time, I was arrested. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=959.02s)]
*  But I think that's the shift, which is not me trying to say the Tories are any better. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=961.26s)]
*  They were the ones giving the Israelis weapons as well. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=966.86s)]
*  But I think you could imagine that it might be linked to labor coming to power, especially [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=969.22s)]
*  after what they did to Corbyn. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=975.06s)]
*  There was a purge in the Labor Party and a crackdown and they got rid of anyone who was [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=977.02s)]
*  pro-Palestine, including Jewish MPs. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=981.38s)]
*  Jackie Walker, Tony Greenstein also booted from labor. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=983.98s)]
*  And he's been charged, by the way, under the Terrorism Act and he was raided as well. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=987.78s)]
*  So I think that is the trigger. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=992.56s)]
*  But honestly, I think it's also because we were having an effect in terms of our reporting. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=996.66s)]
*  Again, we're not taking sides. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1000.3399999999999s)]
*  We were just telling the truth about what's happening in Palestine. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1001.5799999999999s)]
*  What effect has this had on other journalists around you? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1007.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, as you said, there have been others since they've gone after you. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1011.38s)]
*  I think Palestine Action is listed in this Israeli Diaspora Affairs Report, right? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1017.14s)]
*  I believe they're also just as an organization targeted for allegedly promoting anti-Semitism. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1023.2199999999999s)]
*  Have you seen, have they succeeded? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1032.1399999999999s)]
*  Are they essentially shutting down voices that detail what's happening in Palestine? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1034.78s)]
*  I think yes. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1043.3799999999999s)]
*  I think they are succeeding. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1044.58s)]
*  They've succeeded in getting away with genocide. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1046.94s)]
*  So if you can get away with genocide on live TV, you can. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1048.98s)]
*  I mean, you're getting away with murder, literally. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1052.66s)]
*  And I think, you know, I had to make a decision when I got arrested whether to tell people [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1056.06s)]
*  or not, because the lawyers, I think in any case, will tell you don't talk about it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1060.74s)]
*  And I know that other people who were detained under Schedule 7, for example, haven't talked [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1065.8600000000001s)]
*  about it publicly. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1070.8200000000002s)]
*  They only, they came to me privately after they saw that I got arrested and discussed [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1071.8200000000002s)]
*  it with me, but they didn't announce it publicly. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1074.98s)]
*  And the reason that some of them, for example, didn't want to talk about it publicly is they [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1077.9s)]
*  didn't want other people to start becoming afraid or for a climate of fear to develop [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1082.5s)]
*  or transpire, which is perhaps what exactly what these powers want when they're arresting [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1089.02s)]
*  and detaining people. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1094.58s)]
*  But what they did to me was so new, again, not just the provision they used, but to make [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1095.6200000000001s)]
*  it an actual arrest and to put me in jail. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1101.82s)]
*  It was so wild that I felt obligated to tell people about what was happening. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1103.98s)]
*  And I think that they are succeeding in silencing people. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1110.1000000000001s)]
*  They've certainly put me in a position where I'm not able to talk because if you've looked [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1113.22s)]
*  at the provision 12.1a, it's so broad. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1118.14s)]
*  I mean, stating a simple fact could really land you in jail. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1121.5800000000002s)]
*  That's how the lawyers explained it to me. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1125.42s)]
*  If they really want to, they can charge you for just saying a simple fact just because [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1127.54s)]
*  the fact is uncomfortable to the government and or perhaps they can twist it into saying [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1131.74s)]
*  you're glorifying a group that's prescribed. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1138.5400000000002s)]
*  But it's not true. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1140.26s)]
*  You're not glorifying anyone. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1141.26s)]
*  You're just stating a fact, but they can still charge you. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1142.66s)]
*  That's what's so dangerous about this law. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1145.02s)]
*  Well, if the goal was to shut down your platform, at least until now, they succeeded. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1147.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they've made it impossible and difficult for me to work. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1155.66s)]
*  Yeah, they have. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1159.46s)]
*  They've come for me in my country of origin and in my country of residence. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1161.8999999999999s)]
*  There's a very clear agenda here, which is like, you know, just to make sure that I stop [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1165.3s)]
*  working. I think there's many aspects to it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1171.06s)]
*  There's a material aspect where they take your equipment as they took mine. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1173.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about at least 10,000 euros worth of gear, every single laptop, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1177.78s)]
*  computer, drive stick that I bought since I started working journalism. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1182.54s)]
*  They took it from me. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1187.54s)]
*  And then there's also a psychological aspect to to rattle you, to make you feel uncertain, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1188.74s)]
*  anxious and and the legal aspect, of course, where the law is so broad that, you know, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1195.02s)]
*  this is not a walk in the park. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1200.78s)]
*  I mean, it's a terrorism investigation. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1201.98s)]
*  It's purely political, so it can turn into anything. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1204.7s)]
*  And I've been unable to work now probably for almost nine months. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1208.94s)]
*  And I don't know how long this is going to go on for. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1213.1s)]
*  But yeah, they've certainly succeeded in that regard. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1216.42s)]
*  But it's also financial, Richard, too. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1219.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I haven't been able to work, so I'm not earning anywhere near the same money [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1221.7s)]
*  I was when I was. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1227.8600000000001s)]
*  What do you think the goal is? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1231.5s)]
*  I mean, I assume the goal is just complete silencing through intimidation of anyone who [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1232.94s)]
*  reports what Israel doesn't want reported. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1241.38s)]
*  Yeah, I'm I'm not quite sure what the end goal is. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1247.42s)]
*  Some lawyers and legal experts told me that perhaps their plan ultimately is to keep me [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1251.78s)]
*  in this state of limbo where they don't have to take it to court, but they can still reap [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1257.3400000000001s)]
*  the benefit of just silencing me out of, you know, well, just basically out of fear of [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1262.74s)]
*  further legal threats. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1270.74s)]
*  So that's one one potential outcome or situation. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1272.14s)]
*  And I'll just I'll just remind people that with Richard Barnard, for example, they had [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1276.14s)]
*  him under investigation for a year with 12 1A. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1281.7800000000002s)]
*  They shot the case. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1284.5s)]
*  They reopened it a week later and charged him. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1285.74s)]
*  So, you know, how can you live like that? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1287.5400000000002s)]
*  You know, you're basically they've got you by the neck for the rest of your life. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1290.5400000000002s)]
*  And and the other option, of course, is that they actually take it to court. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1295.46s)]
*  I don't know what their plan is. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1300.66s)]
*  And, you know, I'm glad that the IFC and the NUJ and the United Nations have stood behind [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1301.78s)]
*  me because as a journalist, especially, you know, I'm accredited in Austria, at the UN, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1306.94s)]
*  in the UK, at the IFC as well, the international one. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1312.6200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, it is a threat to everyone to to basically silence a journalist for their [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1316.5800000000002s)]
*  reporting to arrest them and put them under investigation. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1322.66s)]
*  And you and I saw what they did to Julian. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1324.94s)]
*  They really took it to court. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1326.38s)]
*  They really put him in jail. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1327.5s)]
*  So I guess all bets are off. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1328.94s)]
*  And it's not very exciting prospect to think about what they might do. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1330.94s)]
*  But I think both strategies align with their interests. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1334.94s)]
*  They can simply avoid the drama of going to court by also just keeping you under investigation. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1337.74s)]
*  I really can't tell what their goal is. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1342.5400000000002s)]
*  They seized a manuscript of yours, is that correct, to the Austrians? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1345.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I was working on on on a book and on on cybersecurity and they they took it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1350.7800000000002s)]
*  And I pleaded with them. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1358.94s)]
*  You know, I even offered to unlock the computer if if they would promise to give me a copy [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1360.8200000000002s)]
*  of the book just so I could keep it, so I don't lose my work. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1366.1000000000001s)]
*  But they they they just took it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1368.1000000000001s)]
*  And did they say that you would eventually get it back? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1371.7800000000002s)]
*  Do you know whether you will ever get any of that back? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1374.66s)]
*  So I I spoke to the IT guys who were picking my stuff apart because they had to bring in [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1379.9s)]
*  two specialists and I tried to I tried to understand what was going on with the gear, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1385.5400000000002s)]
*  what's going to happen if they they can't get in? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1392.3400000000001s)]
*  What will they do with it? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1394.2600000000002s)]
*  And they explained to me that if they can't get in, they might ship it off to a different country, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1395.46s)]
*  which I found very interesting, to say the least. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1401.14s)]
*  They said, of course, that this would go through official channels through, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1405.3000000000002s)]
*  you know, police departments across the world cooperate with each other. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1408.66s)]
*  So that's what they meant. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1411.7800000000002s)]
*  But to me, I understood it as well. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1413.38s)]
*  My gear might be in London tomorrow morning or in Tel Aviv. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1415.7800000000002s)]
*  Right. And honestly, I don't know where it is. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1418.42s)]
*  And I asked the police, these agents rather several times, when do I get my stuff back? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1421.5400000000002s)]
*  Because you're taking my my work tools. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1426.42s)]
*  You know, these these are work tools. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1428.74s)]
*  I can't work without them, whether it's the phones, the computers, all of it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1430.74s)]
*  And they told me that if I give them the passwords or the encryption keys, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1434.8200000000002s)]
*  I'll get them back sooner. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1439.46s)]
*  But that if, you know, if I don't, it's going to it's going to take a while. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1441.62s)]
*  And I told them, well, how soon will I get them back if I were to give you the passwords? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1445.62s)]
*  Hypothetically. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1449.06s)]
*  And they said, oh, yeah, maybe in a year or a couple of months. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1449.78s)]
*  And I said, well, where's the incentive in any of that? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1452.6599999999999s)]
*  Because again, I don't have anything to hide. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1455.22s)]
*  I just really want my tools. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1457.06s)]
*  But yeah, they said it will take a while. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1459.7s)]
*  And I asked them, and if I don't give you the encryption keys, how long does that take? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1462.58s)]
*  They said a couple of years. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1466.4199999999998s)]
*  And the next day after the raid, they came back to my to my studio, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1468.34s)]
*  these two of these agents, and they handed me a receipt. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1474.1s)]
*  And it's so long, I didn't even read it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1478.1799999999998s)]
*  It's really like at least 19, 20 pages, I think 25 pages. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1480.4199999999998s)]
*  So what they did is they had three receipts. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1484.9799999999998s)]
*  They had a receipt from when they detained me and they searched me and, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1486.7399999999998s)]
*  you know, basically pickpocketed me. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1489.62s)]
*  And then they had a second receipt from my home and then a third receipt from my studio. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1491.86s)]
*  So these were all the devices they had taken off my person and my workplace and my home. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1496.66s)]
*  And it was literally like 20 plus pages, at the very least. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1501.14s)]
*  And I again asked them, when do I get my stuff back? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1506.66s)]
*  And they said it might take a couple of years and it might be broken when you get it back. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1508.5800000000002s)]
*  Because if you don't give us the encryption keys, we have to pick it apart. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1511.46s)]
*  And yeah, it could break. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1514.5800000000002s)]
*  I know you use encryption. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1518.42s)]
*  I don't have as much faith in it. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1520.26s)]
*  But talk a little bit about the security measures [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1522.74s)]
*  that, and I know you recommend, you've recommended it to me, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1525.78s)]
*  the security measures you use and the security measures you feel journalists should use. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1529.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just the encryption by itself, but the most important thing is the operating system [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1537.8600000000001s)]
*  that you're working on. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1544.02s)]
*  Because, you know, an iPhone is encrypted on paper. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1545.3s)]
*  But how many people have had their phones hacked because they were using iPhones? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1548.82s)]
*  And I'm talking specifically about journalists. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1554.18s)]
*  I was speaking to one from Lebanon just a while back, a few weeks ago, who was seeking my advice [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1556.8200000000002s)]
*  because she had been told by Apple that her phone had been hacked using Pegasus, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1563.22s)]
*  this Israeli spyware tool. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1568.9s)]
*  Jamal Khashoggi was killed, literally chopped up because his phone was compromised. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1571.0600000000002s)]
*  So it's really about the operating system. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1575.38s)]
*  And stock Android is no good. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1578.1000000000001s)]
*  When I say stock Android, I mean like Samsung or Huawei or Xiaomi, when you buy it as it is. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1582.42s)]
*  And iOS is no good. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1588.3400000000001s)]
*  So your best bet with a phone is Graphene OS. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1590.18s)]
*  That is a stripped down version of Android. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1593.06s)]
*  There's almost nothing on it. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1595.94s)]
*  And you can, of course, install Google services on it afterwards and make it work like a full phone. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1598.9s)]
*  You would never be able to tell the difference. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1605.06s)]
*  But it's completely, completely stripped down. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1606.74s)]
*  And it only works on Google Pixels for the time being. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1609.54s)]
*  Not because you should trust Google. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1615.46s)]
*  On the contrary, but when you install Graphene, you wipe the phone of Google's operating system [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1617.06s)]
*  and then you install Android as Graphene OS, which is stripped down. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1622.18s)]
*  And again, Android does not belong to Google. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1626.8999999999999s)]
*  It's open source and you or I could go and make our own version of it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1628.6599999999999s)]
*  And it takes advantage of the hardware inside. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1632.42s)]
*  All the other phones, they don't have a secure element inside to protect your passwords, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1634.6599999999999s)]
*  to protect your encryption key, which is exactly what law enforcement rely on to hack the phones. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1639.06s)]
*  If you recall, the FBI, they asked Apple for a back door and then Apple didn't give it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1644.4199999999998s)]
*  But they managed to hack it anyway. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1649.62s)]
*  That's because there's no mechanism inside the phone, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1651.78s)]
*  a physical mechanism that stops them from hacking it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1655.06s)]
*  It's all software. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1657.3s)]
*  And unfortunately, most phones, they lack that hardware element, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1658.58s)]
*  that secure element, which Google Pixels have. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1662.34s)]
*  So any journalist who's serious about protecting themselves and their colleagues, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1664.34s)]
*  should be on Graphene OS on Google Pixel. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1668.98s)]
*  This is what I recommend. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1670.74s)]
*  This is what I use. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1671.54s)]
*  This is what Snowden recommends and uses as well. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1672.34s)]
*  And that's what I've been writing about in my book. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1676.66s)]
*  And I've interviewed the leaders of Graphene OS, the lead developers and many, many others. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1679.3s)]
*  It's a comprehensive cybersecurity Bible. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1684.98s)]
*  And when it comes to laptops, you should be using Cube OS, which is a version of Linux. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1688.34s)]
*  And again, I really did not enjoy researching and writing this book, but I had to do it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1692.58s)]
*  I felt obligated to help others. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1698.1s)]
*  And that's a manuscript that they took from me. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1700.82s)]
*  So yeah, I'm working on that. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1703.2199999999998s)]
*  And I think it's going to revolutionize how journalists and activists and lawyers protect [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1705.4599999999998s)]
*  themselves. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1710.5s)]
*  It's very, very necessary. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1711.2199999999998s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the press coverage of the genocide, which has been, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1712.34s)]
*  I think, appalling. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1719.3799999999999s)]
*  Your work has stood out. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1721.78s)]
*  Al Jazeera has done some good work. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1724.58s)]
*  Max Blumenthal at Grayzone has done some good work, but it's a pretty small number. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1728.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1737.3s)]
*  And you've also done very good work, Chris. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1737.86s)]
*  Of course, that goes without saying. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1740.8999999999999s)]
*  And the number is very small because I think many people are aware of what's going to happen [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1742.5s)]
*  to their careers, to their freedoms if they tell the truth simply. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1749.54s)]
*  It's not about picking a side. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1755.06s)]
*  Again, the truth just happens to be to Israel's detriment because Israel's committing genocide. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1756.18s)]
*  It's not because we specifically are trying to pick on anyone. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1760.8200000000002s)]
*  But I think many people realize that they don't end up like me or like Julian. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1765.22s)]
*  And so they try and keep their heads down. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1770.26s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily justify it, but I certainly started to digest and understand [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1773.38s)]
*  why people don't speak out that much about what's happening in Gaza once this stuff happened [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1778.26s)]
*  to me. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1783.22s)]
*  I got it, if you know what I mean. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1784.42s)]
*  I really understood it now. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1787.14s)]
*  Apparently, everyone was ahead of me. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1789.14s)]
*  But I'm just being a bit sarcastic. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1790.58s)]
*  But I really think that that's the reason. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1794.02s)]
*  And there's a phrase about this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1796.18s)]
*  All it takes for evil to triumph is for good people, for good men to stand idly by. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1798.74s)]
*  And I think that many journalists are simply too afraid to talk about it. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1805.46s)]
*  And they see that career advancement lies with protecting Zionism. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1809.6999999999998s)]
*  And they will regret this one day. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1814.4199999999998s)]
*  Not only because it's morally wrong and repugnant, but also because what integrity do they have [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1816.5s)]
*  as journalists by not telling the truth, by lying? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1824.1s)]
*  And if I may just add a parenthesis about press coverage, the UK press still haven't said a word [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1827.3799999999999s)]
*  about what's happened to me. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1834.1s)]
*  The Austrian press did cover it, however. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1835.62s)]
*  They all covered it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1837.6999999999998s)]
*  It was on TV. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1838.42s)]
*  It was in the paper everywhere. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1839.14s)]
*  So at least they had the decency to talk about it. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1841.7s)]
*  There was no UK press that covered your arrest? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1846.18s)]
*  No. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1851.14s)]
*  And I know for a fact that they were aware of it through mutual acquaintances. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1851.54s)]
*  And they haven't talked about it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1856.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, they could have perhaps redeemed themselves by covering the letter that the UN wrote to [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1858.26s)]
*  Keir Starmer a few months later. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1864.66s)]
*  They also didn't cover that. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1866.74s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1868.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1870.5800000000002s)]
*  What are you, you know, reflecting on this over the past nine months? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1872.74s)]
*  Do you see a way out? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1880.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I just see the walls closing in, especially here under the Trump administration, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1881.94s)]
*  with kind of frightening rapidity. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1886.8200000000002s)]
*  If I'm being perfectly honest, it's, I'm not just talking about myself now, but [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1890.5800000000002s)]
*  about the whole situation, it's quite depressing. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1894.8200000000002s)]
*  We see that the Israelis and all their backers in London and Washington were able to get [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1898.5s)]
*  away with genocide and there's no one to hold them to account. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1904.9s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not naive. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1908.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, I know the UN and, you know, the ICC and the ICJ, you know, and all the courts [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1910.5800000000002s)]
*  in the world weren't going to help. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1918.66s)]
*  I mean, my parents worked in the UN. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1921.3000000000002s)]
*  They're the ones who tell me firsthand that, you know, they can't, it just, the UN just [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1922.9s)]
*  doesn't get anything done. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1927.14s)]
*  But nevertheless, just to see it played out like that, I think, I mean, it's even worse [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1929.3000000000002s)]
*  than Iraq, honestly. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1934.5800000000002s)]
*  And I thought Iraq was bad. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1936.18s)]
*  The, I'm not just talking about the war itself with the failure of international law, how, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1937.7s)]
*  you know, we saw the UN go to, sorry, the US go to the UN, Colin Powell, then just, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1941.22s)]
*  you know, ignore what the Security Council had to say and invade anyway in the UK following [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1946.5800000000002s)]
*  them. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1950.18s)]
*  I feel like this was even a larger demonstration of just how, you know, morally bankrupt the [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1951.14s)]
*  West is, unfortunately. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1959.6200000000001s)]
*  And I feel like no amount of photos or images of dead children in the world is going to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1961.46s)]
*  change people's minds. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1966.98s)]
*  And so, yeah, it feels like the walls are closing in and I don't just mean that about [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1968.9s)]
*  me. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1972.9s)]
*  I'm just talking generally on, you know, reflecting generally on this whole situation. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1973.14s)]
*  It does feel like that. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1978.42s)]
*  You and I both have spent time in Arab countries since the genocide began. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1981.5400000000002s)]
*  It seems that that genocide has now created a divide that's almost unfathomable or [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=1995.14s)]
*  unbridgeable, given the very justifiable rage on the Arab street, the great anger at the [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2001.0600000000002s)]
*  Arab regimes, which are in most cases client regimes of the United States, Saudi Arabia, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2010.5s)]
*  Jordan, Egypt, etc. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2016.34s)]
*  As somebody who knows the Arab world, what do you see happening? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2019.14s)]
*  I mean, I just see this, you know, now this gap between, probably, that can never be closed [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2022.9s)]
*  between the global South and the global North. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2030.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's difficult to say, Chris, because you would expect most Arab leaders and Muslim [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2033.22s)]
*  leaders to be on the side of the Palestinians. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2043.6200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, once upon a time, maybe they were. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2046.42s)]
*  But I feel like the fact no one has held the West to account is also emboldening people, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2050.82s)]
*  you know, like the Saudis or the Emiratis to kind of just say, well, why not go ahead and [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2058.74s)]
*  normalize ties with the Israelis? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2063.7799999999997s)]
*  And I know they put on a show, you know, they paused it for a bit. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2065.94s)]
*  And even Erdogan, who's giving the Israelis fuel and food, likes to talk about how much [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2068.58s)]
*  he supposedly dislikes Netanyahu and Zionism. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2074.42s)]
*  But they're all friends, you know, under the table, behind the scenes. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2077.94s)]
*  They're all friends. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2081.06s)]
*  And no matter how much hatred or anger or, you know, or outrage people feel on the streets [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2082.18s)]
*  of the Arab world, I don't think that it's going to hold enough sway when it comes to [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2092.2599999999998s)]
*  these leaders. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2097.62s)]
*  I think they're going to go ahead with the Abram Accords plus whatever and just normalize [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2098.2599999999998s)]
*  ties. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2103.3799999999997s)]
*  I think that's the direction we're headed in. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2103.62s)]
*  And so there's not just a divide between the global North and global South. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2105.3799999999997s)]
*  There's also a divide between, you know, what the average person feels, what the average [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2108.58s)]
*  Arab person feels and what their leaders are doing. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2114.58s)]
*  And look at Syria now, the last Arab state that had some kind of leverage in the sense [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2116.9s)]
*  that it refused to recognize Israel and it was, you know, it was opposed to Zionism. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2123.14s)]
*  That's gone too. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2128.2599999999998s)]
*  So that's another obstacle the Israelis have managed to remove, a massive one that they've [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2129.14s)]
*  been working out for 40, 50 years. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2133.22s)]
*  And this is this again speaks to what I was saying, where I feel that they've achieved [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2135.46s)]
*  massive, massive strategic victories. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2141.54s)]
*  They've gotten away with genocide. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2143.7000000000003s)]
*  They've removed their opponents, whether they're in Gaza, in Lebanon or so in Palestine, Lebanon [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2145.14s)]
*  or Syria. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2151.38s)]
*  And, you know, why should Arab leaders listen to their own people when they can just make [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2152.26s)]
*  more money and make more business ventures come to fruition with the Israelis? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2157.86s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2164.18s)]
*  They're just going to go ahead with their plans. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2165.3799999999997s)]
*  So I don't know how that's going to transpire. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2168.02s)]
*  But I'm shocked in Syria seeing how many people just don't care that Israel is taking more [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2171.46s)]
*  land because we talk about what they're doing in Palestine. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2177.14s)]
*  People forget that Syria is also occupied by Israel and Syria has lost more ground now. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2180.3399999999997s)]
*  You know, the most strategic point in the Middle East, Mount Haramon, they took at the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2186.74s)]
*  Israelis in the last months. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2190.02s)]
*  And I think it's the fatigue from the war that explains part of it. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2191.7799999999997s)]
*  But it's shocking to see the animosity and the indifference from even some Arab people [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2196.5s)]
*  towards the fact that they're losing land and there's a genocide. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2204.3399999999997s)]
*  It's quite shocking. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2207.8599999999997s)]
*  And just to close, where do you see the genocide going? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2209.9399999999996s)]
*  How do you think it's going to play out in Gaza and maybe the West Bank? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2216.1s)]
*  Well, I think the plan originally was to get this gas that is off the coast of Palestine [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2222.1s)]
*  and Lebanon and Syria because we have to remember that they sanctioned Iran when Trump pulled [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2229.14s)]
*  out of the nuclear deal. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2233.7s)]
*  So that cut off a large amount of gas to Europe. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2235.06s)]
*  And then Russia was sanctioned. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2237.9399999999996s)]
*  That also cut off a large amount of gas. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2239.06s)]
*  And then the Israelis signed a gas deal with Egypt and the EU. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2240.98s)]
*  But where are they going to get this gas from? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2244.5s)]
*  So I think that's one of their economic goals. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2247.06s)]
*  And they, of course, plan to settle it, to expel and deport and ethnically cleanse Gaza. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2249.86s)]
*  That was something they announced as well in the first couple of days. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2255.78s)]
*  And they haven't abandoned these plans. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2259.94s)]
*  I think this is where it's headed. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2262.42s)]
*  And no one's paying attention to the West Bank, unfortunately, where they're also stealing [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2263.78s)]
*  more and more land. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2268.6600000000003s)]
*  And they're now using planes to bomb it again, like during the interfaith. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2269.38s)]
*  They've got tanks rolling through there as well. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2274.26s)]
*  So this is what happens. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2276.82s)]
*  What we were talking about earlier, where we have people standing idly by, it just allows [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2279.38s)]
*  evil to flourish. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2283.86s)]
*  So when the press corps don't do their job, this is what happens. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2285.2200000000003s)]
*  The lack of coverage promotes and allows for the growth of this kind of aggression. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2289.54s)]
*  And so their whole plan for the Middle East is a Greater Israel. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2295.94s)]
*  So they're not only going to take the resources, but they're also going to take the land and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2300.1800000000003s)]
*  colonize it to expand. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2303.3s)]
*  You heard Smotrich saying just a few months ago on television that their Greater Israel [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2306.4199999999996s)]
*  will extend to Damascus. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2311.22s)]
*  Lo and behold, they're basically on the outskirts of Damascus. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2312.74s)]
*  So it's headed in that direction. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2317.2999999999997s)]
*  That is what is happening. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2319.22s)]
*  They've achieved massive strategic victories. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2320.5s)]
*  And again, I don't say that because I'm on Israel's side. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2323.22s)]
*  I say that because that is what seems to be the case on the ground. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2326.1s)]
*  Of course, only time will tell. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2331.14s)]
*  But right now, they've gotten away with it. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2332.34s)]
*  And their plans are exactly that. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2334.42s)]
*  Economic. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2336.26s)]
*  Take all the resources, help out the Europeans, help out the West, and of course, take the [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2338.5s)]
*  land for their Greater Israel project. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2343.94s)]
*  That's where it's headed. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2345.46s)]
*  But you've also traumatized now hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, half of the [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2347.06s)]
*  residents of Gaza are under the age of 18. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2354.98s)]
*  They don't have the only mechanism they have to fight back at this point, with the [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2358.1s)]
*  exception of maybe the armed groups like Islam Jihad and Hamas, is terrorism. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2365.22s)]
*  They don't have an air force. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2369.8599999999997s)]
*  They don't have it just seems inevitable that there's going to be what the CIA calls [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2371.2999999999997s)]
*  blowback. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2375.22s)]
*  And if there is a terrorist attack in the UK, that can be traced in some way to not [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2377.3799999999997s)]
*  just Palestinians, perhaps Muslims. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2384.74s)]
*  That seems a gift to figures like Trump to just shut everything down instantly, maybe [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2387.62s)]
*  Stammer as well. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2393.06s)]
*  It could be. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2395.54s)]
*  It could be. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2396.58s)]
*  And what's sad about all this is that the number one victims, even though perhaps Trump, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2397.14s)]
*  Stammer would claim otherwise, but the number one victims at the end of the day continue [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2404.8999999999996s)]
*  to be Arabs and Muslims. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2408.18s)]
*  And you look at what Al-Qaeda did, you look at what ISIS did. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2409.2999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, these spooks that are playing all these games, the ones that caused this blowback [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2413.06s)]
*  and who coined this term in the first place. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2420.74s)]
*  I mean, I find it incredible that they have the nerve to accuse me of terrorism because [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2422.58s)]
*  I got blown up by Zawahiri, who is Jolani's mentor, who is Bin Laden's mentor, when he [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2427.22s)]
*  targeted the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2434.26s)]
*  And then they have the nerve to accuse me of being a terrorist. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2436.18s)]
*  So I did realize the irony in all that. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2440.58s)]
*  And it works out to their benefit, doesn't it? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2444.82s)]
*  They either use these people as tools or then when it turns to blowback, they suddenly create [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2449.94s)]
*  more racism or rather a larger climate of racism and fear and xenophobia so they can [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2456.66s)]
*  get away with pushing a right-wing agenda. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2462.1s)]
*  So I mean, again, I don't want to sit here and pretend like it isn't depressing. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2464.66s)]
*  It is, you know, and that's just what's going on. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2471.38s)]
*  I think we'd be, you know, we wouldn't be doing the truth justice or people justice [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2475.46s)]
*  by trying to paint this as a rosy picture. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2481.62s)]
*  It really isn't. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2483.7s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised just to underscore your point, Chris, if things like that happen. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2485.46s)]
*  And again, I'm not taking sides or justifying anything. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2490.9s)]
*  It's just that I've been a victim of that myself with CIA blowback when they lose control [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2493.54s)]
*  of their proxies. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2499.22s)]
*  And, you know, I think that anything is possible. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2501.38s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2509.7799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2512.1s)]
*  That was Richard Medhurst. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2512.42s)]
*  I want to thank Diego, Thomas, Sophia, and Max who produced the show. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frm2Ckcsm7M&t=2514.5s)]
