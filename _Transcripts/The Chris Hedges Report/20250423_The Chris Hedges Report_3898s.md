# Israel’s Eradication of Gaza’s Healthcare System (w/ Dr. Feroze Sidhwa) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0)
*  Israel during the genocide has repeatedly targeted Gaza's 36 hospitals, clinics, ambulances, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=0.0s)]
*  and killed over 1,000 medical workers, including over 400 doctors and nurses, many in targeted [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=17.64s)]
*  assassinations. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  22 of Gaza's hospitals are now only partially functioning, chronically short of medicine [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=25.72s)]
*  and basic supplies, caused by Israel's total blockade imposed on March 2 of all humanitarian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=32.6s)]
*  supplies including food. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  The latest medical facility to be bombed by Israel is the Al Ahly Arab Hospital in Gaza [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=42.959999999999994s)]
*  City, the largest remaining functioning hospital in northern Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=49.04s)]
*  The Al Ahly Hospital was treating hundreds of patients when Israel, on short notice, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=54.68s)]
*  ordered its evacuation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=60.16s)]
*  Patients many critically ill were carted out to the road. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=62.6s)]
*  The hospital was then hit by at least two missiles. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=66.32s)]
*  In October 2023, nearly 500 people were killed in an Israeli air attack on the Al Ahly Hospital. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=70.44s)]
*  Israel routinely blames errant rockets launched by armed Palestinian factions for the explosions [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=78.68s)]
*  or claims hospitals are being used as command and control centers by Hamas and are therefore [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=85.0s)]
*  legitimate targets. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=90.76s)]
*  This last claim was made by Israel to justify the most recent missile strike. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=92.8s)]
*  But Israel rarely offers evidence to back up its allegations. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=98.34s)]
*  Today we discuss Israel's systematic destruction of Gaza's health infrastructure with Dr. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=102.64s)]
*  Feroz Sidwa, a general trauma and critical care surgeon in California who recently returned [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=109.08s)]
*  from Gaza. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=116.72s)]
*  This is your second trip to work in Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=118.36s)]
*  Before we begin with what's happening in Gaza, you should talk about all the roadblocks that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=121.24s)]
*  are put before medical workers who want to go volunteer to work in the hospitals in Gaza. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=126.44s)]
*  Yeah, so the first time I went was March of 2024. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=134.56s)]
*  And at that time, the the Rafa crossing hadn't been taken the border between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=141.6s)]
*  And so the Egyptians didn't care if you took in a whole bunch of extra supplies because [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=147.04s)]
*  they knew that the hospitals were being starved. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=152.42s)]
*  There's no regular resupply of the hospitals for surgical equipment for antibiotics, even [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=155.14s)]
*  just simple things, things that couldn't possibly be weaponized. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, I took if I'm remembering correctly, it was a year ago now, but if I'm [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=164.72s)]
*  remembering right, I took about 850 pounds of stuff with me on my British Airways flight. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=169.24s)]
*  I gave another 250 pounds to another guy who was going from just he just lives north of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=173.8s)]
*  me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=178.44s)]
*  And so I alone brought like 1100 pounds of stuff, all medical stuff, no, nothing, nothing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=179.44s)]
*  really, nothing else. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  By the time we left Gaza in two weeks, it was it was really all gone. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=187.84s)]
*  I went with Mark Perlmutter, who took about 700 pounds of orthopedic implants. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  So yeah, so that that was a crucial way for for physicians, nurses, others to bring things [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  in that are that are needed because the hospitals just can't get resupplied. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=201.76s)]
*  Obviously it's not enough like individual people can't bring in enough medical equipment [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=207.28s)]
*  for a whole society one one one person at a time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=210.4s)]
*  But but it was something. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=213.96s)]
*  You know, I think if I'm remembering right, Rafa was taken on May 7th and now you now [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  the way medical teams what these are called are EMTs, emergency medical teams. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=222.64s)]
*  It's a World Health Organization mechanism. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=227.32s)]
*  And so the WHO talks to COGA, the Israeli office that coordinates with humanitarian [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=229.72s)]
*  groups for the IDF. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=236.2s)]
*  And everybody gets so the the WHO puts together a team. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=238.44s)]
*  So for me, it was six people or five health care workers. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=243.16s)]
*  And and they and then everybody gets pre approval from the Israelis. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=248.48s)]
*  So you get pre approved. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=252.88s)]
*  Oh, great. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=253.88s)]
*  I got pre approval. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=254.88s)]
*  So you fly to Amman, the capital of Jordan. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=256.04s)]
*  You wait. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  You have to get there two or three days early. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  So now you've already taken more than four weeks off of work, which is very difficult [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=261.12s)]
*  for an American physician to do. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=264.6s)]
*  I'm very lucky in that I have supportive partners who helped me do that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=266.64s)]
*  But you've taken four or five weeks off of work. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=270.72s)]
*  And you fly to Amman and like literally less than 12 hours before you're going to cross [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=273.76s)]
*  the border, you get final approval. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=278.12s)]
*  Now in my group, just to illustrate how ridiculous this is in my group, I, you know, I'm a 43 [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=280.84s)]
*  year old guy, so I'm certainly a man of military age. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=286.84s)]
*  And I've been perfectly public about what I saw in Gaza, what I did there, what other [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=290.2s)]
*  people have seen. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=294.96s)]
*  I've written a New York Times article, I've written a Politico article. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=295.96s)]
*  So I've been like fairly public. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  I was admitted. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=300.35999999999996s)]
*  Tammy Abu-Ghanayem, who was with me, is probably the next most vocal person on the trip. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=302.36s)]
*  And she was admitted. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=308.16s)]
*  The people who were denied are a 78 year old pediatrician with two fake knees named John [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  Kahler, who obviously couldn't possibly pose a threat to anybody. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=314.8s)]
*  And then an American Army veteran and woman who probably weighs about 105 pounds named [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  Bing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=324.72s)]
*  How could you, what is the logic? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=327.24s)]
*  What's the reason behind it? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  It seems to be quite literally at random. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=332.0s)]
*  So you know, our team didn't have half of the people that we were expecting to have. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=336.12s)]
*  The hospital didn't have half of the extra staff help that it was expecting to have. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's not as big of a problem as bombs falling out of the sky. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=345.52s)]
*  But it's clearly just disruption for its own sake. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=349.88s)]
*  So let's talk about your first trip and your second trip and comparing the two of them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=354.44s)]
*  And talk about, you know, where you were located, what you did, what your day was like. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=360.88s)]
*  But I'm assuming this second time, it must have been even more horrendous than the first [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  time in terms of shortages and power outages and everything else. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=371.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  So the first trip was March 25th to April 8th, if I'm remembering the dates correctly, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  just two weeks. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=382.08s)]
*  And when we were, and I was in Cognumus at European Hospital, which is on the eastern [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=383.28s)]
*  edge of the city, pretty close to the border zone or the border with Israel. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=388.56s)]
*  So when we got there, at the time, basically all of Gaza's hospitals were also refugee [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=395.24s)]
*  camps or displaced persons camps, however you want to say it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=402.44s)]
*  And so not only was the grounds of the hospital, like the hospital campus was a refugee camp, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=405.47999999999996s)]
*  but even inside the hospital in the hallways lining every hallway, lining every area that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=415.48s)]
*  was available were families living in improvised tents. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=421.04s)]
*  You know, just some string hanging a sheet from the ceiling so that people could have [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=424.88s)]
*  a little bit of privacy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=432.16s)]
*  And so there were about 1,500 people living inside the hospital, not patients, just living [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=434.04s)]
*  inside the hospital. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  And then on top of that, it's a 220-bed facility that had 1,500 people admitted to it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=440.44s)]
*  So you can imagine in this situation, it's not really a hospital anymore. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=445.64s)]
*  There's kind of hospital stuff going on, but it's not really a hospital. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=450.59999999999997s)]
*  It's impossible to keep anything clean. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=453.88s)]
*  You know, women were like draining out canned foods in the ICU sink. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  It was just, yeah, it was completely ridiculous. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=460.4s)]
*  Furthermore, the entire healthcare staff was already either homeless or, you know, the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=462.4s)]
*  The real destruction of Khan Unis was happening at that time. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=467.32s)]
*  So it was very unsafe to move from, especially because European hospitals on the far eastern [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=470.32s)]
*  edge of the city near the border. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=475.92s)]
*  It's very dangerous for people to come and go from the hospital. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=478.84s)]
*  So most of the healthcare staff actually lived at the hospital as well. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=481.96s)]
*  The OR staff slept in the operating room at night or in the sterile processing facilities. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=484.48s)]
*  You know, it is just completely ridiculous. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=489.48s)]
*  So the hospital, truth be told, it really just couldn't function like this. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=491.32s)]
*  And, you know, we were able to do some good work, but not much, to be perfectly honest. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=497.32s)]
*  You know, when I first got there, I did wound care rounds, which took about three days to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=504.32s)]
*  find everybody in the hospital who had a serious wound. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=510.32s)]
*  Half of them were small kids. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  What were the wounds? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  Describe the wounds. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  So the wounds were of different varieties. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=520.32s)]
*  Some of them were surgical wounds, meaning like they had had a laparotomy. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=522.32s)]
*  Somebody, the general surgeon had looked inside their abdomen and then the wound had become [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=525.32s)]
*  infected afterwards, which virtually every wound did. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=530.32s)]
*  So the skin had to be opened and the pus had to be allowed to drain out. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=532.32s)]
*  But then that requires constant wound care going forward. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=536.32s)]
*  That was probably, I don't know, a third, I'm just guessing, but about a third of them. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=539.32s)]
*  And the other two thirds were really serious injuries to the limbs. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=543.32s)]
*  Part amputations, partial amputations, severe degloving injuries, like where, you know, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=548.32s)]
*  the part of the limbs kind of banana peeled off, things like that. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=552.32s)]
*  And so I found about 250 people, like I said, half of them small kids who needed not just wound [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=557.32s)]
*  care, but actually operative wound care. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=563.32s)]
*  Like they needed to be taken to an operating room with all the bells and whistles that we have [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=565.32s)]
*  there, nice lighting, anesthetics, things like that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=569.32s)]
*  Well, there's only four operating rooms at European Hospital. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=573.32s)]
*  How am I going to take 250 people to the OR every day? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=576.32s)]
*  Just me. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=578.32s)]
*  Like this is completely ridiculous, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=579.32s)]
*  So what we had to do was actually start taking ketamine. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=581.32s)]
*  It's an anesthetic that lets you keep breathing. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=584.32s)]
*  And we had to start, we had to take that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=587.32s)]
*  And I just brought, I brought a little pulse oximeter, the little thing that tells you how [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=590.32s)]
*  high your oxygen is, that I bought off of Amazon. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=593.32s)]
*  And that was the only monitoring I had. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=596.32s)]
*  I would just bring the ketamine out to the regular ward and I would anesthetize people on the ward. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=598.32s)]
*  This is, you know, I use ketamine in the United States for my patients. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=604.32s)]
*  So it's not like I was doing something I've never done before. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=607.32s)]
*  But this is not the way you do these things properly. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=610.32s)]
*  There's no sterility. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=613.32s)]
*  And even in the operating room, to be honest, there wasn't much sterility, but the ward was obviously much worse. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=614.32s)]
*  You know, there's cats walking around. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=619.32s)]
*  There's no, there's no, there's no sterility. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=621.32s)]
*  Little kids are running in and out of the room while we're doing this stuff, you know, and every room has [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=624.32s)]
*  three or four times as many people in it as it's supposed to, you know, because like I said, 220 bed facility, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=628.32s)]
*  but with 1500 people admitted to it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=633.32s)]
*  So so it was basically just impossible. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=635.32s)]
*  You can imagine the hospital just can't function like this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=639.32s)]
*  So almost ever. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=641.32s)]
*  Actually, I think quite literally I might be there might be one or two exceptions, but I think literally every [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=643.32s)]
*  hospital in Gaza has at some point been forcibly evacuated, meaning everyone was told, leave or we'll kill you if you don't leave, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=648.32s)]
*  which is, you know, evacuation isn't really the right term for that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=655.32s)]
*  But and when once once they were evac, once they were once people were forcibly displaced from the hospital, the hospital [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=658.32s)]
*  administrators usually made the decision not to allow refugees to come back into the hospital itself. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=668.32s)]
*  The grounds of the hospital are right outside it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=674.32s)]
*  That was fine. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=676.32s)]
*  But they they said, look, the hospitals just can't function like this. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=677.32s)]
*  So then when I went back to to Nasser this time when I was there, March, I guess it was six to April 1st, the thankfully the hospital was not a DP camp anymore. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=680.32s)]
*  And so the hospital could actually function. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=693.32s)]
*  But, you know, I got there on March 6th. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=696.32s)]
*  And like you said, the blockade had been or the cut off of all entry and exit into Gaza of any goods whatsoever had started on March 2nd. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=698.32s)]
*  So a few days before. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=707.32s)]
*  So the hospital can no longer be resupplied with anything. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=709.32s)]
*  Well, from March 6th, when I was there until the 18th, there were, you know, we did see trauma cases, maybe one or two surgical cases a day due to trauma. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=713.32s)]
*  But otherwise, the hospital was actually working in its normal elective capacity, fixing hernias, taking out people's gallbladders, things like that. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=722.32s)]
*  The normal normal general surgical problems that any of us can can get at any moment. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=729.32s)]
*  Well, so we weren't burning through our supplies, in other words, but on March 18th, that's when the bombing campaign restarted just that day, literally just that day that morning. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=733.32s)]
*  I know because I'm writing a paper about this for a medical journal. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=743.32s)]
*  Nasser Medical Complex just by itself saw two hundred twenty one patients just just that morning. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=746.32s)]
*  Just to give you an idea of how extreme that is. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=753.32s)]
*  And I was a resident during the Boston Marathon bombing. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=756.32s)]
*  It was an explosion of terrorist attack in 2013 in Boston during the marathon. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=760.32s)]
*  And in that in that attack, it was it was in the city of Boston. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=766.32s)]
*  Boston has six level one trauma centers, if you include Boston Children's Hospital, because it's a pediatric level one trauma center. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=771.32s)]
*  And between them, they have 4000 beds. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=776.32s)]
*  Right. Nasser Medical Complex, with the tent extensions that it has, has 450 beds. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=779.32s)]
*  So about about a tenth in all of the hospitals. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=784.32s)]
*  In all of Boston, all of the level one trauma centers together saw one hundred twenty nine patients that day. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=788.32s)]
*  Nasser alone saw two hundred twenty one patients. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=795.32s)]
*  The differential is just enormous. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=799.32s)]
*  So you're talking about a huge expenditure of hospital resources and the hospital not only can't be resupplied anymore, but the hospital's warehouse was actually destroyed during the raid on Nasser, which had been a year before I got there. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=801.32s)]
*  It was actually when I was at European Hospital, they were raiding Nasser Medical Complex about a year ago. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=817.32s)]
*  How was it? How was it? How was it destroyed? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=823.32s)]
*  Yes. So the so the the hospital has a relatively new building. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=826.32s)]
*  I think it was built in 2020. It was a dialysis unit on the first and second floors. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=831.32s)]
*  And then the hospital's warehouse was the third floor. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=836.32s)]
*  The Israelis invade when the Israelis invaded and basically smashed Nasser Hospital to pieces. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=838.32s)]
*  They went into that building. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=844.32s)]
*  They found that it was a dialysis center and then they just burned the whole place. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=846.32s)]
*  They just set the whole place on fire. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=850.32s)]
*  You can still see actually the burn marks on the outside of the you know, where the flames came out of the window. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=851.32s)]
*  Was that early in the genocide or when was it? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=856.32s)]
*  That was in March of twenty twenty four. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=858.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was. So the Israelis raided Nasser Medical Complex in February of twenty twenty four. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=861.32s)]
*  And then again in March of twenty twenty four. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=867.32s)]
*  February, they certainly caused damage and a whole lot of disruption. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=869.32s)]
*  And I think about half a dozen patients died during that time. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=874.32s)]
*  And they arrested a whole bunch of people. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=878.32s)]
*  But then they came back in March and that's when they really, really destroyed the place. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=880.32s)]
*  Tore it to shreds, arrested most of the medical staff, buried people in mass graves outside the hospital, burned the warehouse, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=886.32s)]
*  forced the the the hospital director. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=895.32s)]
*  I think his name was Dr. Atif, if I remember correctly, or he's still there now, forced him to make a confession in sitting in front of Israeli flags in his office. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=899.32s)]
*  I mean, just completely ridiculous nonsense. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=908.32s)]
*  Was that was that mass grave, which I remember reading about? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=913.32s)]
*  Were those mostly patients? Who had died? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=917.32s)]
*  I honestly don't know the answer. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=921.32s)]
*  So so there were this is this is sad. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=922.32s)]
*  There were two mass graves at Nasser Medical Complex. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=924.32s)]
*  From what I've been told, I haven't read a report about this, but from what I've been told, and it makes some sense, the mass grave. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=927.32s)]
*  So we lived on the fourth floor of the hospital. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=935.32s)]
*  This was so to the west on the western edge of the hospital grounds right at the there was a large courtyard that had been a tent encampment. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=938.32s)]
*  The Israelis came through. This is a year ago now, right? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=947.32s)]
*  In March of last year, the Israelis came through the tent and through the wall, destroyed the entire tent encampment. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=949.32s)]
*  And of course, threw everybody out. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=956.32s)]
*  They then dug a mass grave in that area just inside the wall of the hospital. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=959.32s)]
*  And from what I'm told, again, I can't verify, but from what I'm told, this was this was filled with bodies mostly from communists, actually. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=965.32s)]
*  Why? I don't know. I don't know if they had been dug up in these rows were looking for hostages or if it was just random brutality for its own sake. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=974.32s)]
*  I really have no idea. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=981.32s)]
*  But then so that's looking west. That's on the western edge on the southern edge of the hospital compound is a small mosque, which is right next to a right next to the morgue. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=983.32s)]
*  And the morgue started burying people in in a mass grave right where the mosque is now. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=997.32s)]
*  That mosque wasn't there before. It's just a tent. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1004.32s)]
*  They started burying people in a very shallow mass grave there because the Israelis wouldn't allow them to take bodies to the graveyard, which is about 300 meters away from the hospital. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1007.32s)]
*  So they were burying people there, but they don't know they didn't have any equipment. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1018.32s)]
*  There's there. They certainly weren't allowed to dig real graves. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1021.32s)]
*  So all of these bodies were mangled by by animals and things like that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1024.32s)]
*  And then after after the Israelis finally withdrew from the hospital, those people were were exhumed and then were buried properly in a grave. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1029.32s)]
*  I want to go back to so the bombing starts on March 18th. You have that day you have right 200 over 200. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1038.32s)]
*  Two hundred twenty one patients. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1047.32s)]
*  Just what it what it looked like. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1048.32s)]
*  Describe what you saw. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1050.32s)]
*  Yeah, so this this like I mentioned, I was I was at the Boston Marathon bombing. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1052.32s)]
*  I was I was working in a hospital during the Boston Marathon bombing at Boston Medical Center and that until up until March 18th. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1056.32s)]
*  That was the biggest mass casualty event I had ever seen. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1064.32s)]
*  But March 18th was a completely different. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1066.32s)]
*  It wasn't even the same. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1068.32s)]
*  It seems strange to call both of the mass casualty events. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1070.32s)]
*  So, yeah, so, you know, the the we were all the bombing started at two thirty a.m. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1075.32s)]
*  We were all asleep in the the fourth floor hospital living quarters where the where the emergency medical teams stay. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1081.32s)]
*  And so the when the some some blast happened close enough that it actually blew the door of our living quarters open. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1088.32s)]
*  It smashed into the cabinet right behind it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1098.32s)]
*  And that was what woke us all up. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1100.32s)]
*  It was incredibly loud. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1102.32s)]
*  And then we realized that the bombing had restarted because it was just it was just continuous at that point. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1104.32s)]
*  The whole hospital was shaking. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1110.32s)]
*  It was incredibly loud. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1111.32s)]
*  It was like I was back at European Hospital. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1114.32s)]
*  And so we all said, well, you know, we better better go down to the emergency room. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1116.32s)]
*  So we all got dressed, went down to the ER and we went to the front of the hospital. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1120.32s)]
*  And I have to say the Palestinians when I was at European Hospital, they did not have the ability to triage to run a mass casualty event properly. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1124.32s)]
*  Nasser was very different. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1131.32s)]
*  The Palestinians are they they really are very good at this. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1132.32s)]
*  I was I was pretty shocked by how efficient they were. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1139.32s)]
*  And just to give you an idea, the when we when we've got down there, patients hadn't started arriving yet. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1142.32s)]
*  And the already at the front of the house, this is like seven or eight minutes after the bombing started already at the front of the hospital, the director, not the director of nursing, the nursing supervisor on call and call it all. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1149.32s)]
*  Who is one of the you probably have at least heard his name. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1163.32s)]
*  He's a he's a general surgeon at Nasser Medical Complex. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1167.32s)]
*  He's quite well known because he was he was imprisoned by the Israelis for six months. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1171.32s)]
*  And so Khalid was at the front of Khalid is 10 years younger than I am. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1176.32s)]
*  He finished residency two years ago and residency in the Gaza Strip is not a very robust experience compared to say like the United States, where it's much, much more structured. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1181.32s)]
*  Nevertheless, he is out there and he's the one that's going to lead this mass casualty event. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1191.32s)]
*  And he does so incredibly effectively. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1196.32s)]
*  People who are obviously dead, even though their families decapitated, chest is ripped open, whatever it might be, their families are obviously begging you, no, no, no, take them and do something. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1199.32s)]
*  No, take them to the morgue. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1208.32s)]
*  They're dead. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1210.32s)]
*  Keep driving the because otherwise the hospital is flooded with dead people and completely uninteresting people who have like a finger injury. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1211.32s)]
*  You know, then then you just don't have any space to take care of the people who are seriously injured. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1220.32s)]
*  So then so then he started directing patients into green, yellow and red red zones. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1225.32s)]
*  The red zone is where me and Dr. Morgan McMonagle, he's an Irish trauma surgeon that was there with us. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1231.32s)]
*  He was with medical aid for Palestinians. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1236.32s)]
*  I was with Medglobal. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1238.32s)]
*  They he called said, look, you guys go to the red area and start taking patients up to the OR as you as you think they need to go. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1240.32s)]
*  So so Morgan and I went to the went to the red area. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1247.32s)]
*  And honestly, the first 10 or 15 minutes, all we did was pronounce small children dead. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1252.32s)]
*  Most of the people in that area were small kids. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1256.32s)]
*  They're laid out on there. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1259.32s)]
*  There were six or seven stretchers in there. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1260.32s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1264.32s)]
*  I think I think six. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1265.32s)]
*  But there's already children laid out all over the floor. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1266.32s)]
*  So like the first the first person I found was this maybe probably a three or four year old girl. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1269.32s)]
*  She had her how her head was still attached to her. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1274.32s)]
*  I really don't know. She just had an incredible number of shrapnel injuries to the head and also some to the neck. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1278.32s)]
*  And the she wasn't breathing properly, so I jaw thrusted her, just meaning like kind of bringing your your anybody who's done, you know, CPR classes learned how to do that. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1283.32s)]
*  And but she still didn't start breathing properly and in a mass casualty event, especially when we don't have a neurosurgeon, that basically means she's going to die. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1295.32s)]
*  She was still attempting to breathe, but she she couldn't. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1302.32s)]
*  So then it was it was because of these brain injuries she had. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1306.32s)]
*  So I just I picked her up. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1309.32s)]
*  I gave her to I assume it was her father is some male relative. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1311.32s)]
*  I gave him to her and I said, take her out there. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1314.32s)]
*  There's an area they literally they do this in every hospital in Gaza. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1316.32s)]
*  Now they have to set up an area where patients can just die with their families because they can't be helped. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1320.32s)]
*  You know, their injuries are either too severe for what the hospital can actually provide or or they're just or it's just they're they're so far gone that it would take, you know, 10 people all day to possibly save their life, maybe have a five or 10 percent chance of saving their life. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1326.32s)]
*  But that means those 10 people aren't working on everybody else who have a 90 percent chance of survival. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1344.32s)]
*  You know, so these are they're called triage decisions and these are, you know, they're not not the most fun things, especially when you're dealing with small kids. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1348.32s)]
*  But so then I think there was one other girl that I pronounced dead in the same fashion. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1355.32s)]
*  And then finally, I found a little five year old girl. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1360.32s)]
*  I thought she was four at the time. She turned out to be five who had a single wound right here on the left side of her face. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1364.32s)]
*  It turned out that that shrapnel had traveled through her brain, but it had stayed on one side. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1370.32s)]
*  So that's actually a survivable injury. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1374.32s)]
*  And other than that, her spleen was bleeding and her left lung was punctured and was bleeding. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1376.32s)]
*  So I took her upstairs. I took her to the operating room, removed her spleen, put in a chest tube. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1381.32s)]
*  One of the pediatric surgeons actually came in in the middle of the operation. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1389.32s)]
*  So I handed it off to him and went across. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1391.32s)]
*  You know, there's a bank of six operating rooms. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1394.32s)]
*  So I just went across and there was a 29 year old woman there named Lovna that one of the residents, Yahya had brought up to to operate on. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1396.32s)]
*  Lovna had a hole in her back about maybe a little bit smaller than a bowling ball just above her gluteal cleft above her butt crack. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1405.32s)]
*  And I don't know what had caused that. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1415.32s)]
*  I've never I saw two such injuries in Gaza. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1418.32s)]
*  One was one of the last people I operated on before I left. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1420.32s)]
*  But I've never seen an injury like that. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1423.32s)]
*  This injury, you know, your pelvis has two wings and the bone right in the middle is called the sacrum. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1426.32s)]
*  It's a very, very dense bone. It attaches your spine to your pelvis. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1432.32s)]
*  It's very, very thick and dense. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1436.32s)]
*  It was completely gone. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1438.32s)]
*  And there's a fine network of veins that sits right on top of it that were just shredded. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1440.32s)]
*  I mean, they were just bleeding everywhere. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1444.32s)]
*  And there's nothing surgically that you can do about this. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1445.32s)]
*  Her vagina was torn. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1449.32s)]
*  Her rectum was torn. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1451.32s)]
*  Her bladder was torn. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1452.32s)]
*  And so we we just basically closed off the rectum because it's dirty and we left everything else alone. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1453.32s)]
*  And we packed her tightly with cotton, with gauze. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1460.32s)]
*  And we took her to the ICU. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1464.32s)]
*  Now, in the U.S. or in Israel or in Britain or actually really any any third world country even that where where it wasn't true that every single hospital was also experiencing a mass cashew. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1467.32s)]
*  The event at the same time, she this this woman would have lived because all she needed was to be transfused with blood for two or three days until those veins stopped bleeding. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1477.32s)]
*  Whether or not the big wound in her back could be reconstructed with flaps and things, I honestly don't know. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1486.32s)]
*  Probably not in the not in the context of Gaza elsewhere. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1492.32s)]
*  It certainly could be. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1497.32s)]
*  But but but because we were in this huge mass casualty event and because there was no way of the hospital getting blood from elsewhere, you know, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1498.32s)]
*  like at Boston Med Center when we during the marathon bombing, if we had started to run out of blood, we just would have called we would have called hospitals in Lowell or in Brookline or like literally just anywhere else. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1506.32s)]
*  And they would have just trucked. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1519.32s)]
*  They would just put a whole bunch of blood in an ambulance and driven it to us. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1520.32s)]
*  That's obviously not an option because every hospital in Gaza is having a mass casualty event at the same moment. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1523.32s)]
*  So the blood bank just said, look, she can only get eight units. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1528.32s)]
*  That's it. But she would have needed like 100. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1532.32s)]
*  So she died. She bled to death 12 hours later. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1534.32s)]
*  The next kid that we operated on me and Morgan and one of the Palestinian surgeons as well was a six year old boy who had two shrapnel injuries to the right side of his heart. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1537.32s)]
*  His heart actually stopped on the way up to the up to the operating room. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1549.32s)]
*  Morgan opened his chest, actually was able to sew the holes closed and get his heart restarted just because the kid's so young. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1553.32s)]
*  He's just physiologically robust. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1558.32s)]
*  His liver was smashed. His right lung, if I'm remembering correctly, had a huge gash in it that we resected with just just removed that part of the lung. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1560.32s)]
*  Basically, his liver was torn and his stomach, small bowel and colon were all all had major holes in them. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1570.32s)]
*  And again, this kid in the flagship hospital, because you remember, Nasser is the biggest hospital in Gaza right now. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1578.32s)]
*  Shifa. I know you've been to I'm pretty sure you've been to Shifa Hospital many times. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1582.32s)]
*  But Shifa doesn't really exist for in any real sense right now. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1585.32s)]
*  I think there's one operating room that's been set up in a dentist's office or something. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1589.32s)]
*  It's completely absurd. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1593.32s)]
*  So right now, Nasser is the biggest hospital in the flagship hospital of any third world country. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1595.32s)]
*  This kid could have survived. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1600.32s)]
*  But at Nasser, we don't have the right types of pressures, the right types of critical care medications and and even just simple things like a pediatric ventilator. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1601.32s)]
*  We just wasn't available. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1611.32s)]
*  So he died 12 hours later. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1612.32s)]
*  The end of this, it just it kind of went on like this. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1616.32s)]
*  The one of the last cases I did on that day was a 16 year old boy named Ibrahim. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1621.32s)]
*  He wasn't bleeding badly, but he had injuries to his his rectum and his colon. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1627.32s)]
*  So and as his belly pain got worse, we said, let's take him to the operating room. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1633.32s)]
*  So we did open his abdomen and found those injuries, repaired them and I gave him a colostomy. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1637.32s)]
*  And he's the he's the boy that was killed on March 23rd when the Israelis bombed Nasser to kill some guy named Ismael Bar-Houm that they don't like. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1643.32s)]
*  And and yeah, so you know, basically the last operation I did on March 18th, that kid, he would have gone home on March 24th, but then he was murdered in his hospital bed on March 23rd. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1652.32s)]
*  Is that because they bombed the hospital? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1666.32s)]
*  Yeah, on March 23rd, Nasser was bombed directly. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1668.32s)]
*  The Israelis were quite proud of it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1671.32s)]
*  They didn't. There was no no attempt to pretend otherwise. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1672.32s)]
*  And yeah, so it was March 23rd. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1675.32s)]
*  It was I think about nine, eight thirty or nine o'clock at night. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1680.32s)]
*  And the so I actually I was like I said, we lived on the fourth floor of the hospital in the EMT area and the men's surgical ward. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1683.32s)]
*  They divide all the wards between men and women. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1694.32s)]
*  The men's surgical ward was on the second floor. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1696.32s)]
*  But the ICU is also on the fourth floor and I have to walk past it to go down there. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1699.32s)]
*  So after Iftar, you know, the evening the evening meal that that Muslims have during Ramadan, after Iftar, I was going to go change Ibrahim's bandages and just and just explain to his family more because, you know, he has a colostomy, but he's a 16 year old kid. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1703.32s)]
*  And so just explaining how to take care of it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1718.32s)]
*  He was actually a pretty pretty smart kid. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1720.32s)]
*  He didn't didn't complain about things. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1722.32s)]
*  And he was already changing his own colostomy appliance. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1724.32s)]
*  But but just to explain to them what's going on, what do you do from here? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1727.32s)]
*  How does he get better moving forward? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1731.32s)]
*  Things like that. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1733.32s)]
*  And when as I walked past the ICU, there was a critical care doctor, a Palestinian critical care doctor. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1734.32s)]
*  I think her name is Hanib. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1742.32s)]
*  But she was like froze. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1744.32s)]
*  There's this guy over here, Mohammed, who's bleeding. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1745.32s)]
*  He was just transferred from another hospital. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1747.32s)]
*  Can you come take a look at us? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1749.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1750.32s)]
*  So I went in there, spent about 10 minutes working up Mohammed and we realized he needed to go to the OR. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1751.32s)]
*  So I said, OK, you'll I told her like you go talk to the anesthesia folks and tell him he needs to go to the OR right away. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1758.32s)]
*  I'm just going to go change this kid's dressings because who knows how long this operation will take. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1765.32s)]
*  He'll be asleep by the time I get out. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1769.32s)]
*  So we're going to change. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1771.32s)]
*  I'm going to go change his dressings. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1773.32s)]
*  And then by the time I do that, I'll come back and we'll be in the operating room with Mohammed. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1774.32s)]
*  And literally as I walked out of the ICU, that's when Mohammed there. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1778.32s)]
*  That's when Ibrahim's room exploded. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1781.32s)]
*  The Israelis, I don't know. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1784.32s)]
*  I don't think they confirmed what they use, but it was probably a drone fired missile. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1786.32s)]
*  The Palestinian the Palestinian guys who cleaned up the ward afterwards found found the munitions remnants and they had a camera on it and stuff. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1790.32s)]
*  So it's probably probably a drone fired missile. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1800.32s)]
*  But but yeah, you know, Ibrahim and this the guy that they were trying to kill Ismail are from the same family. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1802.32s)]
*  They're like distant cousins or something. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1809.32s)]
*  So the so they were put in the same room because that just makes family visits easier and things like that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1811.32s)]
*  And and yeah, so this so this kid was killed in this hospital. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1817.32s)]
*  But I was almost killed because I was literally on my way down to be standing right next to him. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1821.32s)]
*  But yeah, I want to talk about sniper fire. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1825.32s)]
*  You know, there's all sorts of reports of children being hit. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1830.32s)]
*  Of course, you may not have seen it, but you know, the people sniper shooting children in the head, etc. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1836.32s)]
*  What can you tell me about Israeli sniper fire? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1842.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I try to be careful about this. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1845.32s)]
*  I don't. So like you said, I wouldn't have seen the shooting, right, because I'm sitting in the hospital waiting for for people to come in. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1848.32s)]
*  So so let's talk about my first trip there, European Hospital in March and April of last year. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1857.32s)]
*  And during that time, there were ground troops in communists. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1863.32s)]
*  And that's where the that's where the hospital is located. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1867.32s)]
*  And and literally, quite literally every day I was there, I did 13 days of clinical work there and I saw 13 children shot in the head during that time. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1869.32s)]
*  I wrote about this in The New York Times. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1877.32s)]
*  And I pulled I pulled about 64 other physicians and nurses who'd been in Gaza as well about what they had seen. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1879.32s)]
*  And pretty much everybody saw the same thing because we were there during the ground while the ground invasion was active. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1886.32s)]
*  And and yeah, most of us saw some and we're not talking about 17 and a half year old boys. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1893.32s)]
*  We're talking about small like preteen children shot in the head or the chest, often with single gunshot wounds to the head or head in the chest. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1897.32s)]
*  And and this was a major this this was constant. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1905.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, I actually I try to be as conservative as possible with these things. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1909.32s)]
*  So I I actually only talk about the children that I actually recorded in my diary when I was there. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1914.32s)]
*  I there were there were entire days where, like, literally, I had one pair of gloves available, like we were out of gloves or there were no gloves. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1921.32s)]
*  So my hands were just like covered in blood the entire day. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1927.32s)]
*  So I couldn't even grab my phone to write anything down, you know. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1929.32s)]
*  So I'm sure I actually saw more. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1932.32s)]
*  I just I just don't remember. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1934.32s)]
*  So, you know, that that was it was a huge problem. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1938.32s)]
*  And the reason the reason that I focused on that in the in the times and then, you know, when I give talks about this and stuff like that, the reason I focused on that is because it kind of illustrates what the Israeli attack is, you know, like because it's always framed as a as a an Israel Hamas war. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1941.32s)]
*  Right. Like like Mark Perlmutter and I when we got back, we wrote an article in Politico. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1961.32s)]
*  And the whole point of this article is to discuss how direct and how how how clearly directed this attack is at the civilian population of Gaza. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1967.32s)]
*  Now, we don't we don't explicitly discuss like that. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1978.32s)]
*  We don't explicitly say that we just show that give people the stories and we hope that they can come to their own conclusion. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1981.32s)]
*  But, you know, you've you used to write for the Times, right? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1987.32s)]
*  So the you know how newspapers work. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1989.32s)]
*  You don't really choose the headline of your article that's decided on by editors. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1993.32s)]
*  You really don't even have anything to do with that question. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1996.32s)]
*  I'm often surprised and you're often a shock. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=1999.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pleasantly surprised. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2002.32s)]
*  Yeah. And that's exactly what happened here is and I just have to give my editor, the editor that we worked with for the piece, Teresa, all the credit in the world. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2004.32s)]
*  I'm sure she didn't choose this headline. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2011.32s)]
*  She was absolutely phenomenal. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2013.32s)]
*  But whoever chose this headline made the sub or I don't know what you call the smaller headline right below the headline. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2014.32s)]
*  But it was what two surgeons saw in the Israel Hamas war. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2020.32s)]
*  And we were like, dude, the whole point of this article is that it's not an Israel Hamas war. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2025.32s)]
*  It's an attack on the population of Gaza. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2029.32s)]
*  But the you know, so that kind of thing was frustrating. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2032.32s)]
*  And that was why I really tried to emphasize that this the shooting of children in the head in in the catchment, like because it's not it's not like, oh, I saw it once one place and maybe one of the like you could argue that one child shot in the head was an accident or a crossfire or just some sadistic soldier who's a psychopath. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2035.32s)]
*  You know, we have those in our society. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2055.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm sure Palestinians have that too. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2057.3199999999997s)]
*  Everybody has that in their society. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2059.3199999999997s)]
*  There are violent, crazy people everywhere. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2061.3199999999997s)]
*  But the when you are talking about in the catchment area of every hospital in the Gaza Strip for more than a year at that point, a child is being shot in the head every day or regularly, meaning almost on a daily basis. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2063.32s)]
*  That can't possibly be an accident. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2080.32s)]
*  The Israeli military is extremely sophisticated. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2082.32s)]
*  They have body cameras. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2085.32s)]
*  I've been told a lot of the sniper scopes themselves have cameras. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2086.32s)]
*  There's obviously cameras on every drone. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2089.32s)]
*  All of the drones missiles themselves also have cameras. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2091.32s)]
*  There's cameras everywhere. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2094.32s)]
*  They know exactly what's going on. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2095.32s)]
*  You know, the the the the killing of the Red Crescent workers and civil defense workers recently illustrates it. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2098.32s)]
*  The Times actually had a good report on it just yesterday where they were they told they talked about how they were shown drone footage and stuff like that. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2104.32s)]
*  And even the Israeli even the drone footage that the Israelis were showing them contradicted what they were saying. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2113.32s)]
*  But the but yeah, so like the they know what's going on. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2117.32s)]
*  It's not like they don't have any clue who their soldiers are shooting. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2122.32s)]
*  And for them, or if you read the Israeli press or if you look at Breaking the Silence, any of these people, they've all pointed out the same thing. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2125.32s)]
*  I'm hardly the first person to mention it, that there just are no rules of engagement that you can the soldiers can do whatever they want. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2131.32s)]
*  Well, if that went on for, you know, two weeks after October 7th, I think I think people could, you know, at least rationally say, oh, well, they're in a rage. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2139.32s)]
*  People are just furious. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2148.32s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2149.32s)]
*  A month, two months, six months, a year. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2151.32s)]
*  No, that's not that's not believable anymore. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2156.32s)]
*  Even if the soldiers are still acting out of a rage, the Israeli military has a policy of not doing anything about it at that point, even if it's just by default. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2159.32s)]
*  So that that was why we focused on that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2166.32s)]
*  Now, when I was back in and this this is I'll mention this for two reasons. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2168.32s)]
*  I didn't see at least I haven't reviewed my notes since I came back. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2172.32s)]
*  But I'm pretty sure I don't believe I ever saw a child shot in the head this time that I was in Gaza. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2177.32s)]
*  I saw plenty of people shot by Israelis, but none were children shot in the head. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2183.32s)]
*  And I think the reason is just because there are no ground troops in Khan Younis now. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2187.32s)]
*  There are in the far eastern side of the city, but they would go to European hospital. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2191.32s)]
*  They wouldn't come to Nasir Medical Complex on the on in Khan Younis proper and on the West. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2195.32s)]
*  It's almost all bombing. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2201.32s)]
*  And in Rafa, because the invasion of Rafa hadn't started when I was there in Rafa, they were just shooting individual people from this giant sniper tower that they've built in the in the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2203.32s)]
*  So so it's just it's not it's not the same thing as having ground troops throughout the city who feel like they can do whatever they want and they know where they won't be punished for it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2216.32s)]
*  But it also goes back to the idea because, you know, the only the only defense that somebody could have, I guess there's maybe two. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2225.32s)]
*  One is that I'm lying, which doesn't track. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2231.32s)]
*  Why would I do that? And even if I'm lying, what about everyone else who saw the same thing? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2234.32s)]
*  It doesn't doesn't really make like why is John Kahler lying? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2238.32s)]
*  Why is Adam Hamo we lying? [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2241.32s)]
*  Why is Mark Perlmutter lying? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2242.32s)]
*  Why is Monica Johnson lying? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2243.32s)]
*  You know, it doesn't make any sense. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2244.32s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2246.32s)]
*  But the second thing that people could say is, oh, you just don't realize they were shot by Hamas, not by the Israelis. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2248.32s)]
*  Well, OK, well, that that seems like it would require like the grandest conspiracy of all time to actually accomplish. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2254.32s)]
*  Like not one Palestinian has pointed out that no, it was Hamas that shot my kid. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2262.32s)]
*  Not like, you know, like 100,000 people are thought to have fled Gaza since this started. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2266.32s)]
*  Not one of them has thought I think imagine what a celebrity that person would become. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2272.32s)]
*  All their problems would be solved in life. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2276.32s)]
*  They'd get all sorts of money from APAC for the rest of their life. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2278.32s)]
*  Not one person is no real. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2281.32s)]
*  I mean, just imagine it. They'd be set for life. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2283.32s)]
*  Not one. Then these are poor people living, living like refugees. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2285.32s)]
*  You know, not one person has said this because it isn't true. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2288.32s)]
*  It's just completely ridiculous. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2291.32s)]
*  Again, could Hamas accidentally have shot a kid in a crossfire? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2293.32s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2297.32s)]
*  Could there be some Hamas lunatic who shot a kid thinking, oh, this is what's going to solve the Israel-Palestinian problem? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2299.32s)]
*  Yeah, that's possible. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2304.32s)]
*  But it doesn't explain the pattern. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2305.32s)]
*  It doesn't explain the longevity of the pattern. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2307.32s)]
*  Doesn't explain the intensity. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2309.32s)]
*  Right. This is just these are silly arguments, you know. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2310.32s)]
*  So so that's why we focused on it. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2313.32s)]
*  Yeah. But oh, but sorry. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2315.32s)]
*  The point I was good. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2317.32s)]
*  No, the last point I was going to make is that, you know, this this idea that it's Hamas shooting these people. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2319.32s)]
*  Well, then why when there are no Israeli there's there's plenty of Hamas people in Khan Younis. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2323.32s)]
*  At least I assume there are. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2327.32s)]
*  Why aren't kids still getting shot in the head? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2328.32s)]
*  You know, how did you handle wounded fighters? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2330.32s)]
*  Did you put them in? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2334.32s)]
*  How did that work? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2335.32s)]
*  So if somebody came in, never saw one. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2336.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2339.32s)]
*  No, I never saw one. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2340.32s)]
*  This is I have to admit that this is a minority position. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2342.32s)]
*  What I'm about to say, but virtually no one and I'd encourage you to ask other people who've worked there. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2345.32s)]
*  Virtually no one has ever encountered an somebody that they were sure was a fighter. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2351.32s)]
*  I when I was at European the week before I got there, people told me that there was one guy who came in with an entourage of other guys. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2359.32s)]
*  And and it was kind of obvious that they were they were militants. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2370.32s)]
*  And this guy, I think he had it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2374.32s)]
*  I think he had a partial amputation of his arm or something. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2376.32s)]
*  And they didn't come in armed, but it was obvious who they were. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2378.32s)]
*  And so they but they didn't get aggressive with people. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2382.32s)]
*  They just said, if you like, tell us what you need. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2385.32s)]
*  They said, oh, we need this, this and this. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2387.32s)]
*  They went and got it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2389.32s)]
*  They brought it back. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2390.32s)]
*  They did an operation and then they just whisked the guy out of the hospital almost immediately. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2391.32s)]
*  Now, um, uh, but that was literally the only person that I ever the only male I should say that I ever encountered who didn't come in with their family. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2394.32s)]
*  And you can you can people can say whatever they want about Hamas, but nobody thinks they're dragging their wives out to the battlefield. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2406.32s)]
*  Like, that's completely ridiculous. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2412.32s)]
*  Um, you know, Hamas films a lot of its operations against Israeli forces. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2414.32s)]
*  And that's just not what's happening. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2418.32s)]
*  Nor nor do the Israelis even claim it is. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2420.32s)]
*  They claim that they're using them as human shields when they're at home eating dinner, you know. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2422.32s)]
*  So the but yeah, no, honestly, I just never, never saw never saw a combatant. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2426.32s)]
*  There was one. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2430.32s)]
*  It was probably March. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2431.32s)]
*  Eighth or ninth before the ceasefire ended. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2433.32s)]
*  In other words, there I saw one. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2437.32s)]
*  I saw a pickup truck with two guys in the kind of typical Hamas garb. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2439.32s)]
*  You know, the face covered the the vest, you know, the kind of military looking vest sort of thing. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2444.32s)]
*  Um, and with rifles of some kind, literally just enter the hospital gate, drive through and exit the other gate. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2448.32s)]
*  That was it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2455.32s)]
*  They were on the hospital property from like eight seconds. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2456.32s)]
*  I was like, I'd quite literally and I because I looked, I was like, oh my God, I've never. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2459.32s)]
*  Oh, they're gone. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2462.32s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2463.32s)]
*  You know, it's like they came in. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2464.32s)]
*  Israel's always making this charge that hospitals are command and control centers. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2465.32s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2470.32s)]
*  Underground tunnel complexes. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2471.32s)]
*  Not that they've ever been able to provide any evidence. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2473.32s)]
*  I want to talk about what's happening. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2477.32s)]
*  I mean, so March 2nd, everything's cut off, including medical supplies. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2478.32s)]
*  The last desalination plant because they've cut electricity is not producing clean water. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2483.32s)]
*  Of course, you have, you know, certainly malnutrition, if not cases of starvation, all sorts of diseases that come with having unclean water and camping next to fetid pools of open sewage, et cetera. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2488.32s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2504.32s)]
*  What's happening to the health system? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2505.32s)]
*  What do you see happening? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2507.32s)]
*  Is it is it? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2509.32s)]
*  I mean, at a certain point, it's going to have to shut down. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2510.32s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're really there is no sign. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2513.32s)]
*  I hate saying this because I respect my Palestinian colleagues deeply and they're they're doing everything they can. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2516.32s)]
*  There is no serious health system in Gaza anymore. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2522.32s)]
*  You know, like I said, Nasser Nasser is the the flagship hospital in Gaza. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2525.32s)]
*  And I everything that I did at Nasser Medical Complex to save people's lives, I could do in my house if you just gave me a knife and some suture and an anesthetic machine. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2531.32s)]
*  I mean, this literally there's nothing nothing else is going on. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2540.32s)]
*  You know, Mark, I keep mentioning Mark Perlmutter. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2544.32s)]
*  He's a he's a Jewish American hand surgeon, orthopedic surgeon that I had been to Gaza with twice now. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2547.32s)]
*  He he talked about how he was actually having to implant not pins, but drill bits themselves into children's bones in order to fixate them because they just don't have pins that are the size needed for for children. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2553.32s)]
*  The just there's there's no way to do anything. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2569.32s)]
*  You know, trauma surgery is is really the most basic part of surgery. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2573.32s)]
*  The goal is to stop people from bleeding to death. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2582.32s)]
*  That's it. That doesn't require a whole lot of fancy equipment or because you just don't have time to use it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2585.32s)]
*  Right. The that's that's just not what it is. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2590.32s)]
*  So, you know, for me, I wasn't out of, you know, if I like I said, if I have a scalpel and I have even one type of suture, I can do the vast majority of things I need to. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2593.32s)]
*  But that's not that's not real medical care. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2601.32s)]
*  You know, real medical care is putting people back together. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2603.32s)]
*  And that's just it's just not it's just not possible. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2606.32s)]
*  It's not doable at all. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2609.32s)]
*  The and that's leaving a site like like like you mentioned the the Ochly Baptist Hospital in in northern Gaza. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2611.32s)]
*  It basically doesn't exist anymore. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2620.32s)]
*  I mean, it's the like part of the building is still standing. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2622.32s)]
*  That's true. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2625.32s)]
*  And doctors can walk back into it if they want to. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2626.32s)]
*  But there's no supplies. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2628.32s)]
*  There's nothing there. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2629.32s)]
*  There's absolutely nothing there. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2630.32s)]
*  And the same is true of the vast majority of hospitals in Gaza. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2632.32s)]
*  There is just nothing there. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2635.32s)]
*  You know, even the ones that are standing that are still physically, you know, the building still physically exists just because doctors are inside a building that doesn't make it a hospital. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2637.32s)]
*  And like you said, nothing, you know, nothing has gotten through since March 2nd. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2647.32s)]
*  We're going in six weeks now. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2651.32s)]
*  And the entire strip has been in a mass casualty event continuously since then. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2653.32s)]
*  So, you know, yeah, there's just there is not I can't imagine that the health care system can function for more than another month or so. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2658.32s)]
*  I just I don't I mean, like function at all, like literally in any capacity. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2666.32s)]
*  I don't know how women who need C sections will get them. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2671.32s)]
*  I don't know how people who even just have regular role general surgery problems will be able to get them. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2675.32s)]
*  I don't know how a kid that has asthma will be able to get albuterol. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2680.32s)]
*  I don't know how somebody with heart disease will be able to get their medications, like just like leaving aside the trauma. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2683.32s)]
*  But yeah, the the the the. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2689.32s)]
*  And then on top of that, like you mentioned, the whole population is is being starved. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2693.32s)]
*  Literally no food has gone into Gaza for six weeks. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2698.32s)]
*  And and the entire local food production system has been destroyed. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2701.32s)]
*  The only place you can actually grow food in Gaza right now is in the sand, you know, which is not do it. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2704.32s)]
*  Because, you know, Gaza Gaza is basically fertile to the east of the Salah ad-Din Road right in the middle of the territory and not fertile to the to the west of it near the nearer to the to the ocean. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2710.32s)]
*  But the Israelis are occupying everything east of the Salah ad-Din Road now. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2720.32s)]
*  So there you can't even grow food except in the sand. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2725.32s)]
*  Maybe some cucumbers will grow outside your tent or something. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2728.32s)]
*  But that's that's where people are getting food now. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2731.32s)]
*  There you know, and actually it's not even it's not even like it just started happening. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2734.32s)]
*  I like like we said, the the block, the the cut off of any entry of anything into Gaza started on March 2nd. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2738.32s)]
*  I got there on March 6th and I was we ate meat that day. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2744.32s)]
*  Now, I don't really care about eating meat, but it's just to illustrate because this is a meat eating culture. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2748.32s)]
*  I eat meat that day and then we didn't eat any any I mean, no meat, no chicken, no fish, no kind of animal protein until I think it was like March 29th when somebody somebody found some chicken somehow. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2752.32s)]
*  And we're Westerners. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2763.32s)]
*  We have all the money in the world compared to everybody else. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2764.32s)]
*  But there's just none of this available. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2767.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's just literally isn't available. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2769.32s)]
*  I think Mark told me that at one point because he went up to Oxenmarder's Hospital in the the town just north of Conyers called Dero Bola. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2771.32s)]
*  He went up there and I think he told me he paid seven dollars for a can of tuna. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2780.32s)]
*  Now, someone might say, well, that was somebody taking advantage of him. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2784.32s)]
*  But no, he had he had he had a local go get it for him. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2786.32s)]
*  And it was seven dollars. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2790.32s)]
*  You know, when I was walking around the market that was right outside of Nasser Medical Complex, it's actually exactly where that I'm sure you saw the video of that poor journalist being burned alive in his tent. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2793.32s)]
*  That tent is literally right outside the right outside of the Nasser Medical Complex. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2804.32s)]
*  I had hung out with those journalists many times in that tent. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2808.32s)]
*  The I didn't know that particular fellow. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2812.32s)]
*  But yeah, but the but walking around in that little market, the eggs when I got there. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2814.32s)]
*  So just four days after the blockade started, when I got there, eggs were about 50 cents each, which is what I pay for, like nice organic eggs in California. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2822.32s)]
*  Obviously, nobody there can afford that. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2830.32s)]
*  When I left, it was more than two dollars an egg. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2832.32s)]
*  You know, I think they were asking for nine shekels per egg. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2834.32s)]
*  This is no no possible way that anybody can afford. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2838.32s)]
*  Actually, I guess so. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2842.32s)]
*  That's even closer to three dollars an egg, actually. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2843.32s)]
*  So the there's just no way that there's no way for people to obtain even food, which, of course, means there are much, much more vulnerable to to traumatic injuries, to infections afterwards, to, you know, pregnant women can't breastfeed pregnant women. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2845.32s)]
*  Once they give birth can't breastfeed. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2861.32s)]
*  So their infants are dying. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2863.32s)]
*  It's not it's not really well appreciated how severe the starvation problem is in Gaza. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2866.32s)]
*  You know, the integrated food security face classification is the the technical group that monitors food insecurity in the world. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2871.32s)]
*  Their last report on Gaza, I think, came out two months ago if I remember, maybe maybe last month. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2877.32s)]
*  But there I just I just did the calculations yesterday or the day before. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2883.32s)]
*  So I might have the numbers not exactly correct, but it's approximately something like this. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2888.32s)]
*  If their classifications of people, they classify households into different phases of food insecurity. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2891.32s)]
*  And given how many how many people are in class five, class four, class three, those are the those are the three classes where mortality actually increases. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2898.32s)]
*  If there if there are estimates of who's in which category are correct, there should be about one hundred and forty people dying of starvation related causes every day in Gaza. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2906.32s)]
*  And that's actually an underestimate because Gaza is an unusually heavily child population and children under the age of five are much more vulnerable to starvation than anybody else, especially newborns, obviously. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2916.32s)]
*  And then their projections because they usually do the IPC reports usually say what happened before this report came out and what do we expect to happen afterwards? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2928.32s)]
*  If there if their projections are correct, it's almost two hundred people a day that are going to start dying of starvation related causes in Gaza. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2939.32s)]
*  And, you know, the the the the story of starvation in Gaza is not a well understood one. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2946.32s)]
*  The the the extreme nature of how hungry Gaza has been for the past, you know, 18 months at this point is it is not something that has been widely reported on. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2953.32s)]
*  And the other the other issue is, you know, anecdotally from Palestinians, I know, who have family in Gaza, many of them are not listed as dead. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2964.32s)]
*  They just haven't heard from them for months. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2974.32s)]
*  So I've got to believe that the numbers of dead are far, far higher than the roughly fifty thousand put out by the Ministry of Health. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2976.32s)]
*  Yeah, so when so me and in October, me and 98 other health care professionals wrote an open letter to the Biden administration. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2984.32s)]
*  I when when Trump was elected, I modified it and sent it to him to through contacts in his his campaign. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2993.32s)]
*  But in that in that letter, we wrote an appendix. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=2998.32s)]
*  If anybody wants to read it, it's that Gaza Health Care Letters. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3001.32s)]
*  We wrote an appendix or yeah, basically I wrote an appendix in which, again, looking at the IPC's phase class, the IPC's reports on Gaza up until that point, which was September of 2024. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3005.32s)]
*  It was basically impossible to estimate that fewer than sixty two thousand people had starved to death in Gaza. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3018.32s)]
*  The technical term is died of starvation related causes. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3024.32s)]
*  But they mean the same thing to most people. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3027.32s)]
*  And now I do want to say that like the leading historian of famine is a guy named Alex DeWall. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3030.32s)]
*  He's at the Tufts World Peace Institute or something like that. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3036.32s)]
*  He disagrees. He doesn't think that the numbers are that high, but he still say he says that there's no way it's under ten thousand. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3040.32s)]
*  I shouldn't let me let me not miss miss quote him. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3046.32s)]
*  He says that it is almost certainly ten thousand or more. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3050.32s)]
*  So, you know, the like that there there's two things with that. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3054.32s)]
*  Number one, the the moral. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3058.32s)]
*  I don't know. I'm not very good with English, but more the moral dastardliness of, oh, well, it's only ten thousand who like no, like starving ten thousand people to death is a shocking crime. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3062.32s)]
*  But it kind of tells you something about ourselves that we don't even know to within like an order of magnitude. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3074.32s)]
*  How many people we've starved to death in Gaza, most of whom will have been small children. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3084.32s)]
*  But, you know, that's terrifying. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3091.32s)]
*  So that's one major cause of mortality that's not reported. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3093.32s)]
*  The second is what we were talking about a minute ago. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3096.32s)]
*  I am quite sure that very, very few combatants are actually counted in the Ministry of Health calculation. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3099.32s)]
*  You know, every time not calculation, the Ministry of Health reporting. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3105.32s)]
*  So like every time the the. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3108.32s)]
*  You know, the Times or the Post or whoever reports the BBC, any of them report, they say the Hamas Ministry of Health says fifty one thousand people have died. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3112.32s)]
*  However, they do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3122.32s)]
*  Now, that's technically accurate because nobody that's not how hospitals do things like I'd never asked anybody. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3125.32s)]
*  Excuse me, sir. Are you a combatant or a civilian? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3131.32s)]
*  I just you know, it's ridiculous. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3133.32s)]
*  But the that's just not medical care is provided to all people, including soldiers like the oldest part. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3135.32s)]
*  You know, the first Geneva Convention is from 1864. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3141.32s)]
*  You probably know this better than I do, but it's from 1864. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3144.32s)]
*  And it's specifically about the care and the protection afforded to wounded combatants, not not civilians. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3147.32s)]
*  So wounded combatants have since you know, since before the American Civil War was over, have been protected people under international law. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3153.32s)]
*  You don't it doesn't matter who they are. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3161.32s)]
*  Like you you take care of people who need to be taken care of. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3163.32s)]
*  And that's regardless of their national affiliation. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3165.32s)]
*  Right. Like if an Israeli soldier comes into the hospital for some reason, I'll take care of him, too. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3168.32s)]
*  Honestly, if Benjamin Netanyahu comes in, I'll take care of him. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3172.32s)]
*  I don't don't really want to, to be honest, but I'd still do it because that's what being a doctor is. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3174.32s)]
*  But the but yeah, so I very seriously doubt that anyone who was actually partiz not anybody, but very, very few people who are actually participating in combat have been brought to civilian hospitals in Gaza. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3180.32s)]
*  And there's a few reasons. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3195.32s)]
*  I mean, number one, almost everybody that I have ever seen in the hospital came in with their family. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3196.32s)]
*  They were all wounded together. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3201.32s)]
*  And like I said, Hamas is just not dragging their their kids and their wives out to the out to the battlefield. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3202.32s)]
*  But number two, Hamas is engaged or not just Hamas, all the Palestinian armed groups are engaging Israeli soldiers in these areas that are already severely bombed out, destroyed, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3208.32s)]
*  If one of them gets shot, I don't see how they could even possibly recover him. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3221.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm no military expert. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3225.32s)]
*  I don't want to pretend I am. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3226.32s)]
*  But, you know, the Israelis when they're when they're directing heavy loads of gunfire or tank shelling or whatever at a at a combatant in the middle of an actual not just bombing the crap out of helpless people, but an actual armed confrontation. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3227.32s)]
*  I just cannot imagine the scenario where they survive long enough to get trucked over. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3244.32s)]
*  This is with Yaya Sinwar. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3248.32s)]
*  He was wounded. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3250.32s)]
*  He was. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3251.32s)]
*  Yeah, no, he has. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3252.32s)]
*  It's a great example, actually. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3253.32s)]
*  They wounded and the drone found him and killed him. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3254.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's a well, it's a pretty good example. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3256.32s)]
*  Sinwar is a good example, you know, because he he was, you know, he was walking around, you know, they claimed he was in spending his billions of dollars in a tunnel or something. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3258.32s)]
*  But the he was walking around. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3267.32s)]
*  They encountered Israeli troops. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3270.32s)]
*  I think his arm was blown off by a tank shelling. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3272.32s)]
*  And then and this is this is in Rafa. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3275.32s)]
*  Right. So then he makes his way into a bombed out building. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3278.32s)]
*  Like you said, a drone finds him and then a tank shells again because they just thought he was some random guy. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3281.32s)]
*  But yeah, when the Israelis are actually confronted by anyone who presents any possible threat to them, they're the level of violence somehow increases even further compared to the violence that's being used against civilians. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3287.32s)]
*  So I just have a hard time believing it again. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3300.32s)]
*  I'm not a military expert. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3302.32s)]
*  If somebody were to explain to me while I'm wrong, I'm happy to listen. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3303.32s)]
*  But I cannot imagine, like I said, the only literally the only story I have heard from any and I've asked people before the only story I've ever heard was that one guy who came in with that arm injury that I mentioned. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3308.32s)]
*  That is the only combatant I know that anyone has encountered in a hospital in Gaza. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3321.32s)]
*  And again, the I should say suspected combatant, but probably was. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3326.32s)]
*  But that that's it. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3329.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3330.32s)]
*  So I'm sure that these people are being just buried and and then Hamas is going on with its life. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3331.32s)]
*  But secondly, there's a huge number of civilians who have definitely the way this these Hamas numbers right the the Ministry of Health. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3337.32s)]
*  First of all, the Ministry of Health is not actually run by Hamas. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3345.32s)]
*  It's it's actually one of the only things in Gaza that's run jointly by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3347.32s)]
*  But the those numbers come specifically from hospital databases of who died. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3352.32s)]
*  I've looked at the electronic database at at Nasser Medical Complex. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3359.32s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3361.32s)]
*  It's very straightforward. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3362.32s)]
*  Category seven means people who were injured in the they categorize patients. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3363.32s)]
*  Category seven is people who were injured specifically in the context of conflict. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3369.32s)]
*  So bombing, shooting, whatever. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3374.32s)]
*  Not not I got beat up in a family dispute. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3376.32s)]
*  Not not not like that. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3378.32s)]
*  So specifically that context of violence, they call it. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3380.32s)]
*  They call it all. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3383.32s)]
*  It's category seven. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3384.32s)]
*  And then category 63 is people who were killed in that context. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3386.32s)]
*  All the Ministry of Health is reporting is the reports that they get from hospitals on a daily or weekly basis. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3389.32s)]
*  I'm not honestly sure. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3395.32s)]
*  Probably a daily basis of category 63. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3396.32s)]
*  And then they're reporting category seven is the injured. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3398.32s)]
*  That's it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3401.32s)]
*  There's no way that everybody in Gaza is conspiring to inflate this number. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3402.32s)]
*  But so the important thing to realize is that's only people who have been delivered to hospital morgues. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3406.32s)]
*  Now, if you're like when I was in communists, right, the first time when I was at European Hospital, I did. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3412.32s)]
*  And I mean this seriously. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3418.32s)]
*  I did one hemorrhage control operation. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3419.32s)]
*  Like, in other words, I stopped one person from bleeding to death while I was there in two weeks. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3422.32s)]
*  And the reason again was because there were ground troops in communists. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3427.32s)]
*  It just wasn't possible to move people quickly to a hospital. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3430.32s)]
*  So if your if your house if your house is bombed or if your neighborhood is in lockdown because there are Israeli troops and your kid or your wife or your husband or whoever is shot and then three days later, you'd be able to take them to the hospital just so that they can be pronounced. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3434.32s)]
*  You know they're dead. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3450.32s)]
*  They've been dead for days. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3451.32s)]
*  Why would you make that dangerous trip over to the hospital? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3452.32s)]
*  What? Just so I can include one more person in my in my death? [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3456.32s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3459.32s)]
*  You're just going to bury them. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3460.32s)]
*  And the other thing is you have whole apartment blocks obliterated and then you have everyone inside. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3461.32s)]
*  Can you can't dig them out? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3466.32s)]
*  I mean this happened to a friend of mine is his wife's sister and her family. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3467.32s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3472.32s)]
*  No, and actually when you when you drive around, when you drive around, you'll see graffiti all over the place on buildings that says Osama is buried here. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3473.32s)]
*  Mohammed is buried here. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3484.32s)]
*  You know, it's just it's everywhere. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3485.32s)]
*  It's literally everywhere. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3487.32s)]
*  And the the civil defense has been estimating 10,000 people are under the rubble since January of last year. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3488.32s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's it's it's just completely you know, if theater postal, he's he's MIT's leading missile technology expert from what I understand. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3495.32s)]
*  He's a Jewish fellow and he he just so people understand where he's coming from. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3505.32s)]
*  He's a Jewish fellow and he classifies. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3510.32s)]
*  He's when he talks about the October 7th attacks, he describes those attacks as having been genocidal. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3513.32s)]
*  Like he thinks they were that was the intent of them, which is I don't agree with him, but that's fine. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3518.32s)]
*  It's his perspective. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3522.32s)]
*  He himself just casually said and he's not saying it carelessly. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3523.32s)]
*  I don't mean to say it that way, but he just casually estimates that at least hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Gaza by bombing. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3527.32s)]
*  He says, just look at the place. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3536.32s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3538.32s)]
*  How could hundreds of thousands of people not have been killed in this bombing? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3539.32s)]
*  Now, the Gazans have a you know, again, you know this better than I do. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3541.32s)]
*  Gazans have a very long history of surviving under bombardment, so they may have an unusual propensity for surviving such circumstances. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3545.32s)]
*  But it everything has a limit, you know. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3555.32s)]
*  But then there's sort of just just in case people are interested in these these data points, the Lancet. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3557.32s)]
*  It might have been the Lancet open or the actual Lancet. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3565.32s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3567.32s)]
*  But the Lancet is a prestigious British medical journal. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3568.32s)]
*  Maybe in at least a few months ago, maybe more than that, they published a paper which it's not really a study. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3571.32s)]
*  There's no statistics involved. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3581.32s)]
*  The the paper was done by researchers. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3583.32s)]
*  If I'm remembering correctly in Japan, Canada, and maybe the United States. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3588.32s)]
*  I think the United States also. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3594.32s)]
*  I think I think at Yale, but I could be I could be wrong. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3595.32s)]
*  But anyway, a big international team. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3597.32s)]
*  And what they did was they got the raw data from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, not the not the aggregate data, but literally line by line, person by person, name, birthday, ID number, everything. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3600.32s)]
*  They got the entire database up until the point where they got it. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3610.32s)]
*  Then they looked through internationally, kind of like Air Wars does. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3614.32s)]
*  They look through international news things and they news. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3617.32s)]
*  Reports and then they also looked at social media postings and they spent God knows how much time just correlating each and every one of these records saying, is it you know what's you know, is it possible that Mohammed so and so killed on this day? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3623.32s)]
*  Who is this age in this location? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3639.32s)]
*  You know, like literally just just just cross referencing each and every one of these things. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3642.32s)]
*  They found that the the Ministry of Health numbers under report even publicly verifiable deaths by about 40%. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3647.32s)]
*  Right, 40%. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3656.32s)]
*  Now that's so that's that's one major thing. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3659.32s)]
*  But the other thing that I would encourage people to do is to look at air, you know Air Wars Air Wars is a British. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3662.32s)]
*  Which basically looks at the the impact that modern modern military, especially Air Force bombing campaigns have on civilians. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3669.32s)]
*  Now, they wrote one of the most shocking reports I've ever read in my life about just the first 25 days 24 days actually of the Israeli bombing campaign in in Gaza. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3679.32s)]
*  So not not the restarting not March 18th, where I'm talking about October 7th to October 30th or 31st excuse me of of 2023 in that less than one month. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3690.32s)]
*  The same number of children 1900 can are verifiably can be can be verified to have been killed the same number of children as in the entire most deadly year for children in another conflict that they had ever found which was Syria in 2016 if I'm remembering the year right in 24 days. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3704.32s)]
*  The same number of children as in the entire most deadly year for children in another conflict that they had ever found which was Syria in 2016 if I'm remembering the year right in 24 days in Gaza, a territory of 2.2 million people. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3720.32s)]
*  The same number of children were killed as in the deadliest year in conflict that they had ever found previously which was Syria, which is a much much larger country actually don't know serious population maybe you do but the that's insane. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3738.32s)]
*  This is completely and this is there there is no like what it's this is and it's hard to. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3754.32s)]
*  It's hard to explain sometimes to people not that not that you needed to explain but the what has been done to Gaza over the past 18 months is quite literally unique there there nothing of this intensity and magnitude and duration has ever been done, especially not to a territory this small. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3763.32s)]
*  You know the destruction of Germany during World War two doesn't even come close the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons doesn't even come close like that's what it's crazed the level of violence that has been inflicted in this place is completely insane and the. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3781.32s)]
*  It's just beyond anything that anyone has ever seen anywhere else before and that there's there's a reason for that is that the world's super pay it's not Israel attacking Gaza it's the United States using Israel's army to of course in any in any practical sense. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3798.32s)]
*  Well yeah when you when you send the entire weight of the American military to bomb a completely helpless civilian population which is half children and now living in improvised shelters not even in the concrete shelters that they were living in before. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3813.32s)]
*  This is exactly what's going to happen. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3828.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's hardly surprising and so like you said the death toll is certainly far far far higher and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it's if it's like nearly an order of magnitude off from reality. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3831.32s)]
*  Yeah, I can't you know can't prove it because there's no data available because the Israelis won't let anybody collect data but the. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3844.32s)]
*  It is just a it's an unbelievably what this will this event will be studied for a long time you know if humans are still around to do it and. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3851.32s)]
*  I don't think we're going to come out looking very good at the end of this. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3863.32s)]
*  Thank you very much for us. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9lEnYa4q0&t=3867.32s)]
