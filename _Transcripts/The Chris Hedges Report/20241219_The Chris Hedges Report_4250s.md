# The Meaning of Christmas (w Rev. Munther Isaac)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc)
*  In the early 1980s I was in a refugee camp for Guatemalans who had fled the war into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=0.0s)]
*  Honduras. It was a cold, dreary winter afternoon. The peasant farmers and their families living [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  in filth and mud were decorating their tents with strips of colored paper. That night they [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=21.2s)]
*  would celebrate the flight of Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus to Egypt to escape the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=27.2s)]
*  slaughter of the children of Bethlehem ordered by Herod. The celebration is known as the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=32.4s)]
*  Day of the Holy Innocence. Why is this such an important day, I asked? It was on this [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=37.92s)]
*  day that Christ became a refugee, a farmer answered. I knew the passage from Matthew [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=43.84s)]
*  about the flight to Egypt by heart. I had heard my father, a Presbyterian minister, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  in services every Christmas in the farm town in upstate New York where I grew up. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=54.72s)]
*  But it took an illiterate farmer who had fled in fear with his wife and children [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=59.68s)]
*  from the murderous rampages of the Guatemalan army and the death squads, who no doubt counted [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=64.4s)]
*  friends, even relatives, among the dead. A man who had lost everything he owned, to explain it to me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=70.48s)]
*  The story of Christmas. Like the story of the crucifixion in which Jesus is abandoned by his [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=77.44s)]
*  disciples, attacked by the mob, condemned to death by the state, placed on death row and executed, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=83.68s)]
*  is not written for the oppressors. It is written for the oppressed, and what is quaint and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=90.72000000000001s)]
*  picturesque to those who live in privileges, visceral and empowering, to those the world [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=95.76s)]
*  condemns. Jesus was not a Roman citizen. He lived under Roman occupation. The Romans were white. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=101.12s)]
*  Jesus was a person of color, and the Romans, who peddled their own version of white supremacy, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=108.4s)]
*  nailed people of color to crosses. The Romans killed Jesus as an insurrectionist, a revolutionary. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=114.0s)]
*  They feared the radicalism of the Christian gospel, and they were right to fear it. The [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Roman state saw Jesus the way the American state saw Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Then, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  like now, prophets were killed. Christmas is not about the virgin birth. It is not about angels. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=133.36s)]
*  It is not even about a historical Jesus. To debate these topics is to engage in a theological, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=138.96s)]
*  trivial pursuit. The Christmas story is about learning how to be human, about kneeling before [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=145.36s)]
*  a newborn infant who is helpless, vulnerable, despised and poor. It is about inverting the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  world's values. It is about understanding that the religious life, and this life can be lived [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=157.52s)]
*  with or without a religious creed, calls on us to protect and nurture the least among us, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=162.88s)]
*  those demonized and rejected. The Reverend Monther Isaac, the pastor of the Evangelical [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=169.2s)]
*  Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem and the Lutheran Church in Bait-Sahur, displays at his [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=174.48s)]
*  church the nativity scene with the figure of the infant Jesus wrapped in a checkered black and white [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=181.04s)]
*  kaffir lying in a pile of rubble. Joining me to discuss the meaning of Christmas is Reverend Isaac. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=187.04s)]
*  So let's begin, Monther, with the Christmas story. Last Christmas, this Christmas, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=195.92s)]
*  of course, you have created this creche. What is it that you were trying to say through that symbolism? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=203.68s)]
*  Yeah, actually when we made it at the church, some, even our church, were a bit surprised and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=210.96s)]
*  shocked because we're accustomed to think of Christmas as a joyful occasion. But the Sunday [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=218.88s)]
*  we presented this creche, I actually preached and said this is actually the meaning of Christmas. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=224.88s)]
*  This represents Christmas more than any other thing, maybe. The idea of Jesus identifying [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=230.96s)]
*  with an occupied community, a community that is oppressed in its pain and suffering. I think many [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=238.48s)]
*  times we forget the actual circumstances in which Jesus was born. We make it a romantic story, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=245.76s)]
*  forgetting that in essence the vocabulary of that story is a refugee family, a tyrant, a massacre, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  taxation. These are all terminologies that we don't usually associate with the Christmas story. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=264.32s)]
*  But to us here in Palestine, they actually make the story as we read it in the Gospel very much a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=269.84s)]
*  Palestinian story because we can identify with the characters. And so the message to me was clear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=276.56s)]
*  If Jesus was born today in our world, he would be born in Gaza under the rubble as a sign of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=284.64s)]
*  solidarity with the oppressed. Just as Jesus was born 2000 years ago among an occupied community, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=291.2s)]
*  a community that is under the yoke of a ruthless empire, in circumstances in which children were [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=298.56s)]
*  massacred and interestingly, sadly, out of all places they escaped to Egypt in the very same way [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  today people from Palestine, from Gaza escape into Egypt. So we see it's the same story. That's what [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=311.84s)]
*  I tried to emphasize. And in that we find comfort as Palestinians because we can look at Jesus [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=318.88s)]
*  not just as one of us, but as someone who is in solidarity with us, identifies with our pain and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  struggle and is in solidarity with us. Let's talk about that call in the Christian Gospel. We are [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=333.04s)]
*  enjoined to love our neighbor, not our tribe. This is perhaps most evident in the story of the good [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=342.24s)]
*  Samaritan. Oftentimes religious systems become tribal. We take care of our own and we ignore [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=350.16s)]
*  everyone else. That's certainly the ethos of Zionism. But that's not the message in the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=358.08s)]
*  Christian Gospel. Perhaps you can address that. Yeah, and I'm grateful you mentioned the story, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=364.48s)]
*  the parable of the good Samaritan, because actually this is one of my favorite stories. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=371.2s)]
*  And in that story, actually, the people who failed to show mercy and compassion, the people who failed [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=377.44s)]
*  to see the Samaritan as a neighbor are religious. They represent the religious institution. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=383.44s)]
*  In our religiosity, we become tribal. In our religiosity, we focus more on what to do and not [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  to do and forget the essence of our faith, which is love God and love neighbor. So I think in that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=400.48s)]
*  story, in its essence, Jesus is lamenting the fact that religious leaders failed to show compassion [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=407.04s)]
*  to that wounded person. And then it was a Samaritan, someone who was despised. The Samaritans were [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  a despised community, a community that at the time were considered even demon possessed. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=421.36s)]
*  When the disciples of Jesus were with him and the Samaritans wouldn't allow Jesus to pass [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=431.04s)]
*  by through their city, the disciples suggested, why don't you call for fire to come and consume [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=436.56s)]
*  the Samaritans? In the same way, you know, we hear today in American politics and Israeli politics [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=441.6s)]
*  suggestions to nuke, get rid of it completely or get it over with quickly. So then Jesus makes [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  those people that were despised the center of the story, actually the example to follow, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=455.12s)]
*  challenging our prejudice. But in that story, there is a really important element that I think [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=461.6s)]
*  captures the essence of what Jesus was trying to say, because the person who was wounded in need of [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=469.04s)]
*  help, Jesus says, was left naked and unconscious. He couldn't speak, so you can detect from his [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=474.08s)]
*  accent. Is he a Jew? Is he a Roman? Is he a Samaritan? He had no clothes, his clothes would [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=485.28s)]
*  not reveal his identity. And I think that's the point of the story. He was a human being. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=491.44s)]
*  And as such, that story begins with the question, who is my neighbor? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=496.56s)]
*  A question which the teacher of the law asked Jesus, and behind it is the assumption, you know, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=501.52s)]
*  who's my neighbor that I should love and who's not my neighbor? And I'm obligated, you know, I'm not [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=507.76s)]
*  obliged to love, you know, that's the question, who's my neighbor? Some people, it's assumed that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=515.04s)]
*  there are some people we must love and others we don't have to love. And the conclusion of the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=519.76s)]
*  story is that, you know, there is no us and them, there is no, everybody is a neighbor. You don't [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  draw a circle and determine who's in and who's out in that manner, in that question, who is my [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=529.84s)]
*  neighbor? And that's the point of the story. When someone is in need, everyone is a neighbor. And we [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=536.0s)]
*  can't choose as if we only help those who are like us. Actually, Jesus said, you know, what good are [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=543.0400000000001s)]
*  you, you know, if you only love those who look like you or who are like you? So it's an important [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  concept because we are used to and we're good at loving those who look like us, who think like us, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=556.8s)]
*  and we are actually masters of drawing these lines, these circles in which we decide who's in and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=564.64s)]
*  who's out. And in that process, we are willing to even go the distance of dehumanizing and demonizing [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=570.7199999999999s)]
*  others. And so clearly today, the Palestinians are outside of the circle. I've been saying it, you [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=579.92s)]
*  know, human rights don't apply on us, not even compassion. People, you know, been watching a [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=586.24s)]
*  genocide life and not doing anything. To me, we need to go back to the essence of the teachings [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=591.84s)]
*  of Jesus. It's not just about loving God, but you can't claim to love God if you don't love your [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  neighbor and then you don't choose who your neighbor is. And this is what we as people of faith, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=603.6s)]
*  and in particular, if we follow Jesus, this is precisely our calling. It's a beautiful story, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  the story of the good Samaritan, for all of these elements involved in it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=617.04s)]
*  I want to talk about religious institutions, as you may have encountered. I certainly have encountered [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=624.24s)]
*  the last acceptable prejudice of the left is against those of us who come out of a religious [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=630.88s)]
*  tradition, no matter what that is. Paul Tillich, the theologian, writes that all [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=636.0s)]
*  institutions, including the church, are inherently demonic. And you can read [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=642.08s)]
*  Moral Man and Immoral Society by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. It's a very important book for me, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=649.04s)]
*  where he talked about institutions, including the church, as essentially dedicated to their [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=654.08s)]
*  own survival, often at the expense of the moral life. And Niebuhr argues, and this is of course [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=661.44s)]
*  Tillich's point, that in order to obtain the moral life or live the moral life, one often has to defy [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  the institution, including the religious institution, in which they find themselves. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=679.2800000000001s)]
*  And you brought this up, that the religious and the story of the good Samaritans, and this is, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  of course, echoed in Jesus going to the temple with the money changers, and other stories in [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=690.1600000000001s)]
*  the Bible. There was a conflict between the institutional hierarchy of the religion at the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=694.48s)]
*  time, which of course was in Jerusalem, he was going after the money changers in the Jewish temple. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=703.2s)]
*  But that is hardly limited to Judaism or any other religion. Let's talk about that struggle to live [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  the moral life, to stand with those James Cone called the crucified of the earth, and how that [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=718.32s)]
*  often puts us in conflict with the very religious institutions we may belong to. Yeah. Well, first, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we need to acknowledge that there is a lot of good that comes from all religions, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=737.44s)]
*  the religious institutions, a lot of actual good that has happened over the years, and is certainly [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=744.96s)]
*  true today. And so I would not characterize them as in the language that was quoted. However, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=753.76s)]
*  I like the classification of the Cairo South Africa document, a document from 1986, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=766.48s)]
*  which spoke of three different theologies, and I think it captures the essence of what you are [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=774.24s)]
*  trying to say, and it shaped a lot of my ministry as well. The Cairo South Africa document talked [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=781.12s)]
*  about state theology, the theology that serves the empire, the theology that serves those in power, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=790.08s)]
*  enables them to dominate, gives them the language for superiority. And in the South African case, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=797.04s)]
*  it's apartheid. In our case, it's Zionism and Christian Zionism. It's those who feel entitled, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=806.24s)]
*  chosen, superior, and they function on a different sphere of reality because God supports them, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=814.0s)]
*  or God has empowered them. So there is certainly that state theology, as Cairo South Africa [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=822.96s)]
*  document calls it. But I think what you're alluding to is what the Cairo South Africa document calls [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=829.0400000000001s)]
*  church theology. By that, they mean the theology that oftentimes prioritizes peace and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  reconciliation at the expense of justice. And so the response to a crisis like what's happening [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=840.5600000000001s)]
*  today in Gaza, a genocide, is a prayer for peace. And in some cases, they go beyond that into acts [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=847.28s)]
*  of charity, yet fail to call out those who are committing a genocide. And I think we need to call [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=854.3199999999999s)]
*  out that line of thinking despite the elements of good that exist in it. But if we fail to call out [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=861.6s)]
*  things by name and speak truth to power, we only empower the oppressors. And I think that church [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=867.6s)]
*  theology as the Cairo South Africa called it was very evident even today as I look at, again, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=875.52s)]
*  a genocide taking place in front of all the world to see. And at best all we get is statements from [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  church praying for peace, calling for a ceasefire, yet failing to call a genocide or genocide the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=888.48s)]
*  same way they fall to call the system we have in Palestine as apartheid, insisting that there is [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=895.6s)]
*  only a conflict. I think behind that is this spirituality of neutrality, and that neutrality [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=900.88s)]
*  only enables the oppressors. And I certainly believe that it's our calling to go with what [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=908.08s)]
*  the Cairo South Africa document calls the prophetic tradition, speaking truth to power, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=915.12s)]
*  and then also taking sides. And I think many times in Christian theology, we fail to capture this [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=921.04s)]
*  important idea of the fact that peacemaking means you take sides. I surprise people sometimes and [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=928.8s)]
*  they, you know, they say God takes sides and they're like no God is with everyone. I say yes, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=936.72s)]
*  God loves everyone and so on, but when there is an oppression, God takes the sides of the oppressed. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=941.2s)]
*  When there is injustice, God takes the sides of those who suffer injustice. When there is [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=946.8s)]
*  marginalization and supremacy, God takes the side of the marginalized, God takes the sides of the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=951.76s)]
*  poor. It's explicit in Scripture. You don't have to imply it from here or there. It's direct in [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=956.24s)]
*  Scripture. And so when I said Christ is under the rubble and this is a sign of God's solidarity with [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=961.92s)]
*  the oppressed, my message was that God's solidarity must become in turn our solidarity. We need to [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=969.12s)]
*  side with the oppressed. We need to speak on their behalf, empower their stories, defend their rights, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=975.36s)]
*  advocate on their behalf, protect and do everything we have in our means in the ethics of Jesus [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=981.28s)]
*  to show that God is inside of the oppressed and that it becomes in turn our obligation as Christians [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=990.48s)]
*  to side with the oppressed. And this is different than we pray for peace and we are neutral. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=999.1999999999999s)]
*  And this is more risky. And let's remember that solidarity by definition is costly. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1005.12s)]
*  And I think this is what many times church leaders try to avoid controversy, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1012.32s)]
*  costly solidarity, and only prefer to stop by the idea we pray for peace and we hope both sides [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1017.36s)]
*  reconcile. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1027.68s)]
*  Yes, it's a kind of studied quote unquote objectivity that commits them to nothing. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  Would you say that this characterizes the response to the genocide by most Christian [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1037.04s)]
*  and religious institutions? Unfortunately, yes, it's changing, but especially in the beginning. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1043.92s)]
*  And that's why I have been calling out church leaders. And let's remember that there are some [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1051.44s)]
*  Christian traditions who still support and call for this genocide to continue. Justify it, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1060.0s)]
*  try to explain it, sometimes give it even theological terms, whether it's the fundamentalist [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1069.2s)]
*  who, you know, it's Christian Zionism. We see today the new ambassador, Pompeo, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1075.44s)]
*  there is no occupation, it's all Judeans and Medias. So they have their own sphere of reality, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1083.3600000000001s)]
*  the biblical one they function with. Or it's even some progressive theologians who said, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1089.04s)]
*  this is the just war theory, you know, Israel has the right to defend itself. They are the ruler [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1095.68s)]
*  executing the justice that should happen. And as such, they call, you know, they use the just war [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1101.68s)]
*  theory. A Palestinian Christian friend of mine, a theologian whose name is Tony Dei said, you know, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1108.48s)]
*  they make the killing of 17,000 children the justice of God. I mean, this is unthinkable to us. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1114.0s)]
*  So sadly, you know, it went from endorsing, supporting, justifying, and then many, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1122.0800000000002s)]
*  especially in the mainline tradition, just made statements. And sometimes these statements, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1129.12s)]
*  repeated Zionist phrases, you know, Israel has the right to defend itself. We call for Israel for [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1135.52s)]
*  restraint, not to kill innocent civilians, we are concerned that Palestinians are killed, and so on. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1142.08s)]
*  Nothing about genocide, nothing about accountability, nothing about the rule of law. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1149.52s)]
*  Interestingly, when it comes to Israel committing war crimes that everyone now is seeing, and it's [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1154.56s)]
*  proven. And so again, this has been part of the system that enabled Israel to occupy and colonize [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1160.56s)]
*  Palestine for years and now to commit obvious war crimes. Well, shouldn't these Christian [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1170.24s)]
*  institutions be calling for a cessation of all weapons to Israel? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1177.92s)]
*  I believe so. And I've said it, and I've called for churches to church leaders for, you know, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1182.64s)]
*  weapon embargo. Listen, at the end of the day, it's about, do we believe as Christians in the [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1190.24s)]
*  rule of law? Do we believe that those who commit war crimes should be held accountable? And in [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1198.48s)]
*  particular, when it comes to the United States, Christian leaders cannot just say, well, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1205.44s)]
*  it's our government. Well, you voted for this government, regardless of where you voted, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1211.92s)]
*  by the way, because it's across, you know, it's a cross-political divide. Both Republicans and [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1217.1200000000001s)]
*  Democrats support Israel. So it's your politicians who give the green light and the political cover [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  for this war. And it's tax money, you know, that's funding this war. So as a faith leader, if [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1229.2s)]
*  you're silent, then that means you approve with how your elected representatives are voting, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1237.44s)]
*  and that means that you approve with how your money is spent. There's no other interpretation of it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1246.8s)]
*  And so we need to call for accountability. And I think for now, obviously, I would support [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1251.8400000000001s)]
*  weapon embargo on Israel. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1258.32s)]
*  Manther, are there any institutional structures within the Christian religion that have [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1261.6s)]
*  embraced that position and calling for a halt to weapons to Israel? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1268.8799999999999s)]
*  We're beginning to see some voices rise today. There is a campaign in the United Kingdom [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1276.32s)]
*  called Advent Not Weapons, something like that. I can, you know, share with you the exact title [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1286.0s)]
*  of it. There are certainly some pastors who are aligned with this vision. I am involved in a group [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1295.04s)]
*  called Kairos Palestine, and we have global Kairos for Justice groups all over the world who [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1304.3999999999999s)]
*  have called to relate to Israel as an apartheid state and as such apply sanctions. And today, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1309.76s)]
*  we are calling for weapons embargo. So we're beginning to see some groups, some grassroots [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1316.0s)]
*  groups, not yet on the institutional level. On the institutional level, some have called Israel [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1322.6399999999999s)]
*  an apartheid state. Some have called for boycotting settlement goods, the PCSA, United Church of Christ, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1329.68s)]
*  and other Protestant mainline denominations. But I think this needs coordinated efforts. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1337.52s)]
*  This needs serious engagement. And, you know, it also means going against the norms of your [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1345.52s)]
*  society. And I think many people find this challenging to do. Every war I covered, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1354.72s)]
*  starting in Latin America, I was in El Salvador during the war, of course, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1363.44s)]
*  Archbishop Oscar Romero, when he called on Salvadoran soldiers not to fire on their own [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1367.76s)]
*  compatriots, was assassinated. But every war that I've covered, the war in the former Yugoslavia, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1373.44s)]
*  and then I was in the Middle East dealing with the Christian Zionists, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1381.52s)]
*  especially in a wartime environment, we saw it in 9-11 in the United States, the institutional [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1387.1200000000001s)]
*  churches have almost immediately sacralized the conflict. And we see this replicated in Israel. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1393.52s)]
*  And those religious leaders who dare to speak out against the war, or in this case, the genocide, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1407.68s)]
*  are often persecuted by their own institutions. And I wonder if you could talk about that, in [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1416.72s)]
*  particular, any Jewish or rabbi, any Jewish religious leader or rabbi who has denounced the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1424.8000000000002s)]
*  genocide. What has the institution, the religious institution, done to them? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1433.8400000000001s)]
*  They are literally persecuted, especially, you know, right now, after October 7th. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1440.56s)]
*  It's hard to openly criticize the actions of the government of Israel. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1444.8s)]
*  But they are speaking out, and they are now fighting even some legal consequences. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1451.76s)]
*  And groups like B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights organization. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1460.08s)]
*  B'Tselem is secular, though. B'Tselem is a human rights organization, not a religious. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1468.08s)]
*  Yes, but at least, you know, it shows that some Jews with conscience are speaking. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1473.36s)]
*  Rabbi is for human rights. And certainly in the United States, Jewish Voice for Peace is [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1479.52s)]
*  doing an incredible job. And others, and it's not just a Jewish Voice for Peace, I think it's [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1485.2s)]
*  becoming the more prominent. It shows that there are those within the Jewish community who are [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1490.48s)]
*  insisting, not in our name, it's wrong, it must stop. And I think the major shift right now, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1500.8s)]
*  Chris, is that those within Judaism who are speaking out are finally seeing that Zionism is [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1508.4s)]
*  a problem. And are finally beginning to realize what we've been saying from the beginning, that, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1515.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, the question is Zionism redeemable? And I hope this conversation takes place on a more [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1523.2s)]
*  serious level within the Jewish community in Israel and in the diaspora. The idea that, you [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1532.0s)]
*  know, Zionism is a settler colonial entity and it's deemed to collapse. You cannot continue to, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1540.16s)]
*  unless you plan to completely eliminate all Palestinians. And this is what scares me. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1547.36s)]
*  So going back to your question, there are some voices in the land, Jewish voices, that are [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1553.68s)]
*  beginning to speak. They have always been there, but I think in the beginning of the war, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1561.44s)]
*  they were hesitant given the severity of what happened on October 7th and the level of, you [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1566.64s)]
*  know, how many people were killed and how they were killed. But now they're beginning to realize [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1572.0800000000002s)]
*  that we can't be silent when there is a genocide happening by our state. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1577.92s)]
*  Well, but very few of these figures are leaders within these religious institutions, is that correct? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1584.4s)]
*  Yes, and not just within the religious institution, even those in the secular [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1592.16s)]
*  domain are still a minority. The political discussion in Israel is, you know, how far do [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1599.76s)]
*  you go? It's not whether there is a middle or the left. The middle and the left pretty much no longer [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1606.48s)]
*  exist. And so it's, you know, in a freaky way, you know, Netanyahu is now considered in the middle [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1611.84s)]
*  and then those Ben-Kvir and Smutrish and others are the ones who are leading Israel into a more [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1620.48s)]
*  right-wing direction. The scary thing also is that more than ever since the inception of Israel, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1627.6799999999998s)]
*  the religious language is so strong in the political discourse. Look at the nation-state law, but also the [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1635.6s)]
*  agreement of the current- You should explain what the nation-state law is for people who don't know. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1645.12s)]
*  The nation-state law is the basic law that was passed by the Israeli Knesset despite a strong [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1651.04s)]
*  objection from many on the secular side and of course the Arab parties. It's a one or two [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1656.72s)]
*  pages, I think, document, but in its essence it emphasizes that the whole land is Jewish and that [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1663.84s)]
*  only Jews have the right for self-determination in the land of Israel. So they say actually explicitly [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1669.84s)]
*  the right for self-determination is exclusive to the Jewish people only in the land of Israel. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1676.72s)]
*  And that goes on to explain that building Jewish settlements in the West Bank, they call it Judea [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1682.48s)]
*  and Samaria is a national duty and right. So this is discrimination by law. I mean if this is not [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1686.8s)]
*  apartheid, what is? You know when you say only one people have the right for self-determination. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1694.72s)]
*  Over against even the indigenous citizens of Israel who are the Arabs, the Palestinians, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1699.76s)]
*  who have been there long before Israel was established as a state in 1948. And then since [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1704.72s)]
*  the nation-state law it kept going more and more to the right to the extent that when this current [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1711.6s)]
*  Israeli government was formed in January of 2023, they stated explicitly in their agreement, this is [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1717.6s)]
*  their agenda, this is their declared intentions that the land belongs exclusively, they call it [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1725.76s)]
*  the land of Israel belongs exclusively to the Jewish people. And I think we need to stop for a [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1733.1999999999998s)]
*  moment and try to imagine the response if the Palestinian National Council or the Palestinian [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1740.08s)]
*  Liberation Organization said such a statement, the land of Palestine belongs exclusively to the Arab [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1746.32s)]
*  Palestinians or to Muslims. I mean imagine the uproar, imagine what we would be called, what [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1752.0s)]
*  Palestinians would be called. But somehow the Israelis say it, they are welcomed as heroes in [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1757.28s)]
*  the Congress. They are exercising apartheid not just in practice but in their laws and they are [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1763.44s)]
*  still considered the only democracy in the Middle East, you know, on the right of freedom and human [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1773.68s)]
*  rights and so on. And the Palestinians are the problem. I want to talk about religious Zionism. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1779.76s)]
*  When I lived in Jerusalem, the liberal Zionists, and I don't want to pretend that they weren't [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1787.92s)]
*  just as vicious towards the Palestinians. In fact, if you take 1948 and 1967 when you had the largest [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1794.0s)]
*  ethnic cleansing, 750,000 in 48, about 350,000 Palestinians driven from their homes, it was [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1801.28s)]
*  under liberal Zionism. But it was different. I mean they didn't like the religious Zionists. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1809.44s)]
*  When I was there, they outlawed the Qaq party led by Rabbi Meir Kahana. That's changed. I think Ben [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1815.1999999999998s)]
*  Gavir recently visited Kahana's grave. These are the heirs to Kahana and they speak, even Netanyahu, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1821.52s)]
*  they speak or they use biblical passages to justify the genocide so that now this assault [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1829.6799999999998s)]
*  against the Palestinians, this attempt at erasure is given a religious veneer. Can you talk about [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1841.76s)]
*  that change? Yes, and again, it's important what you said. It's not as if liberal Zionism was [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1848.56s)]
*  friendly and then this because oftentimes some get the impression that it's only when Zionism [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1856.24s)]
*  became religious that we have a problem. But certainly now this is dangerous because [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1863.84s)]
*  when you bring the religious dimension to it, first you make it a religious conflict. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1870.56s)]
*  And again, this is scary. It's scary because when you make it a religious conflict, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1876.96s)]
*  you by definition become on the right side simply for representing your religion and your God because [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1887.36s)]
*  we assume your religion is the right one and your God is the right one and everyone else is false [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1895.28s)]
*  God's idols and so on. So it becomes your mandate and that's dangerous when you have a mandate from [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1899.36s)]
*  God to implement the will of God by force. You'll do anything because you have God on your side. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1904.8s)]
*  And again, not only are you now righteous but then by implication those on the other side [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1912.6399999999999s)]
*  are, as Netanyahu said, the Amalekites. It's okay to completely erase them. It's okay to [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1921.12s)]
*  completely kill them. And so there is no telling where this will lead us. And I find it again [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1928.24s)]
*  shocking that the very same people in the West who condemn and vilify Muslims when they do this, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1940.96s)]
*  they are okay with Israel doing it. Actually you have those on the Christian right who support it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1952.24s)]
*  So we need to continue to emphasize that what we have in Palestine is not a religious conflict [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1957.68s)]
*  and we need to continue to emphasize the danger of bringing this language of divine entitlement [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1963.28s)]
*  into such discussions. Because to put it very, very simply, if my side of the argument, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1971.2s)]
*  if I have an argument with you Chris, my God told me so, then how can we continue the conversation? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1978.96s)]
*  You know, because any position you take makes it a position against God. So it becomes impossible [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1985.3600000000001s)]
*  to talk. And if we don't yield to a set of laws that we all agree on, which is in this case the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  international law, it might not be perfect but it's something we all agree on at this stage. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=1998.64s)]
*  Then if everyone brings their own set of reality, understanding of reality based on their religion [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2005.44s)]
*  and their interpretation of their scriptures and the religious entitlement, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2012.08s)]
*  then there's no telling where this will lead us. It's chaos, it's violence, it's madness, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2016.24s)]
*  and it's frightening honestly where this will lead us. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2023.04s)]
*  It's also the externalization of evil. So you know in my tradition and I believe yours, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2029.04s)]
*  the greatest battle is actually a passage in the Quran where the prophet talks about the [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2035.6000000000001s)]
*  struggle, the greatest jihad is the struggle within us, the struggle to [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2042.8s)]
*  make sure that the evil within us doesn't actualize itself. The great writers of the Holocaust, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2048.56s)]
*  Primo Levi and others, write the same thing. But when you externalize evil, then evil is embodied [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2053.68s)]
*  in the other who when you, in this fantasy, when you eradicate them, you see the way the Israelis [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2059.12s)]
*  talk about the Palestinians in Gaza as essentially either being witting or unwitting agents of Hamas. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2066.3199999999997s)]
*  But when evil is embodied externally in the other, then you defeat evil by erasing, killing the other. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2075.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes, and then the killing of the other becomes actually a righteous act, an act that is defended [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2086.56s)]
*  as justice, as I said, the justice of God when you use for example the just war theory, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2094.08s)]
*  or you know you're doing humanity even a service. Look at how Palestinians were described [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2101.68s)]
*  in the beginning of the war and throughout, you know, animals, the Amalekites. And even beyond that, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2111.6s)]
*  I think it takes a lot of years and systematic dehumanization of the Palestinians to reach the [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  level where we are right now. I am shocked and I say this honestly, I am shocked when Christian leaders [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2129.12s)]
*  defend the killings in Gaza by yielding to the, you know, by just repeating the claim Hamas is [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2137.84s)]
*  using Palestinians as human sheets. And you know, I don't want to get into whether this is right or [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2147.52s)]
*  wrong regardless of it's been widely disputed. But the whole idea that even if true, that to you it's [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2155.6s)]
*  okay to kill 100 Palestinians to get to one Hamas militants is shocking to me. And it makes me think [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2162.88s)]
*  how much dehumanization of Palestinians did it take and even demonization of Palestinians did it [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2169.52s)]
*  take for you as a Christian minister to reach this level where it's okay for you to say just [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2175.52s)]
*  kill 100 of them to get rid of one or two Hamas militants. It shocks me because it proves what [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2181.36s)]
*  we've been saying. They don't look at us as human beings. They don't look at us as equals. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2188.64s)]
*  And this doesn't happen day or night. And I refer here to what another Palestinian theologian, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2193.12s)]
*  Youssef Khoury said. He's from Gaza. And you know, we Palestinians continue to emphasize this war did [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2200.3199999999997s)]
*  not start on October 7th, but to him the genocide itself began not in 1948. The genocide began with [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2208.4s)]
*  talking about Palestine as a land without people. Because that's when we were erased. That's when [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2215.76s)]
*  they looked at the land and they didn't see people. They knew the land had people. But they're not [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2222.96s)]
*  people of equal worth. They can be removed. They can be erased. They can be displaced. They can, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2229.36s)]
*  you know, we can make them give half of their land to the new incoming Jewish settlers and so on. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2236.1600000000003s)]
*  And so once you look at and look at a whole group of people as inferior and then you use a system [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2241.76s)]
*  tragically of theology to justify that by making some people superior and entitled or by, you know, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2249.04s)]
*  demonizing the religion of others, as we see often the case when it comes to the Middle East and Islam. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2257.1200000000003s)]
*  The result is what we see right now in Gaza. This didn't happen day and night. You don't [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2264.6400000000003s)]
*  wake up and decide it's okay to kill, you know, Palestinians on this scale. It took years of [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2269.52s)]
*  dehumanization and demonization of Palestinians to the extent that when the war on Gaza happened [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2276.64s)]
*  in 2023, the world was ready to accept this tragic fate for the Palestinians. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2282.88s)]
*  I want to talk the Amalekites. That's a term that Netanyahu now throws around regularly. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2294.48s)]
*  But talk about that biblical story because it's quite chilling. As I remember, you can correct me, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2300.96s)]
*  it's been a while since I was in Divinity School. It's not just the slaughter of the men, women, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2306.88s)]
*  and children, but even the animals. It's the complete destruction. But talk about that story [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2312.32s)]
*  because it's become a refrain used by Israeli leaders and by the IDF, by soldiers to justify the genocide. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2319.4399999999996s)]
*  Raise their memory even, you know, raise anything that. So the Amalekites were a group of people [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2329.4399999999996s)]
*  in the ancient times that had a problem with the Israelites and the decree from God was to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2334.48s)]
*  destroy them, to kill them all. So that phrase became synonymous to enemies of God, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2343.6s)]
*  enemies of the people of God. So if you are enemies of the people of God, you are enemies of God. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2349.6s)]
*  And there is this justification of, as you said, killing everybody, raising their memory. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2355.7599999999998s)]
*  It all stems from this logic of reading a biblical story and drawing a picture of the [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2364.48s)]
*  history of Israel. And it's the logic of reading a biblical story and drawing a straight line to [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2370.08s)]
*  the Israel of today, reading a straight story again from those who dwelt the land back then. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2375.36s)]
*  And when the Israelites came, they fought with them, with the current indigenous Palestinians [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2381.92s)]
*  of the land and determining all over again that God is on our side. We are the chosen ones. God [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2387.04s)]
*  and as such. And again, the whole concept of, for example, the Israeli UN ambassador carrying [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2394.24s)]
*  the Bible in the UN is chilling. You know, it gives this assumption again that God is on our side. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2402.8799999999997s)]
*  We are entitled. And the fact, as I said, that the world was ready to accept the characterization [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2411.52s)]
*  of Palestinians and the people of Gaza as the Amalekites, which means accepting their total [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2421.92s)]
*  erasure, killing, destruction, even remove their memory is shameful, is chilling. And [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2428.88s)]
*  sadly, years from now, it will be studied as a case point how not to use scripture. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2439.52s)]
*  But when it was done, not many people speak to challenge that language. And by the way, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2447.2799999999997s)]
*  it's not just Netanyahu. You know, in my book, I mentioned the many evangelical pastors who use [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2453.2799999999997s)]
*  the very same language. So let's be clear. It's not just as if the Israeli politicians, many, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2458.72s)]
*  many, many pastors and theologians use the same language. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2463.6s)]
*  I want to ask you about Christian Zionism, but I'm reminded of a quote by the theologian H. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2468.4s)]
*  Richard Niebuhr who said, religion is a good thing for good people and a bad thing for bad people. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2472.48s)]
*  And this is kind of the perfect example. Let's talk about Judea and Samaria. That is a term [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  that is now used by regularly by the Israeli government. It's a biblical term to describe [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2482.8s)]
*  the West Bank. What are they doing? What they're doing is eliminating thousands of years of history [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2488.0s)]
*  of culture, of civilizations. What they're doing is imposing one phase of history. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2497.52s)]
*  OK, and I'm not going to even go into the, you know, argument, archaeological arguments of how [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2508.08s)]
*  accurate and how historical these biblical stories are. I'm just going to assume that it's true. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  So what they're doing is imposing one reading over every other reading, making it superior to any [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2520.64s)]
*  other reading and in the process eliminating thousands of years of history and cultures and [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2528.0s)]
*  civilizations. What they're doing also is justifying settler colonialism, making it acceptable today. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2537.2s)]
*  Because let's be honest, you know, what is it that, what right did, or even today, let's not talk [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2550.64s)]
*  about 1948, a Jewish person living in Brooklyn, and we have many of them today, settlers in the West Bank, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2557.52s)]
*  by what right does he come and claim possession of a house and live in the West Bank and have more [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2566.48s)]
*  rights than a Palestinian, he needs something to prove that he's entitled to this. And so this is [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2572.56s)]
*  where the Bible comes to aid. So what they're doing is finding the language that makes [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2579.44s)]
*  settler colonialism and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, which is what happened when [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2588.0s)]
*  Israel was created, making it Jews returning to their homes. And if you think with me for a moment [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2592.32s)]
*  of that simple statement, Jews return to their home, Chris, you grew up in a church and I'm sure, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2600.08s)]
*  you know, you've heard this, it's very common in church circles, you know, not just among evangelical [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2608.72s)]
*  Christian Zionists, it's very common everywhere. And so you see what happened here, you know, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2613.9199999999996s)]
*  settlers came to Palestine, created a mass refugee crisis, expelled people from their homes, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2619.12s)]
*  destroyed their villages, their memories, started a state under the ruins of their towns and villages, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2626.16s)]
*  yet somehow called it, we are returning to our home. Why? Because the Bible says so. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2633.76s)]
*  And this has become the normal reading. It's not disputed. And interestingly, when I say [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2640.32s)]
*  Israeli settler colonial entity, some people dispute that. What they're doing is making it [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2648.1600000000003s)]
*  acceptable that, and this is what shocks us, you deny a Palestinian from Gaza the right to return [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2656.0s)]
*  to their towns and villages from 1948, yet somehow you celebrate the fact that a Jewish person, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2662.0s)]
*  as I said, from Brooklyn, who comes and settles in the West Bank on a land confiscated by Palestinians, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2669.28s)]
*  from Palestinians, I mean, you make that a return to their home. This is what they're doing. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2675.2s)]
*  And the world buys it. The Christian world, and by and large, bought it, celebrated it. And of course, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2681.2s)]
*  we can't undermine the effects of the guilt of the horrors of the Holocaust. Nevertheless, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2688.16s)]
*  you see what happened here is that settler colonialism became, we returned to our homeland. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2694.08s)]
*  And I think there's one more thing that happens here when you call it Judea and Samaria. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2701.7599999999998s)]
*  You completely neutralize the international law. You completely neutralize [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2707.04s)]
*  the human rights of Palestinians for self-determination. So when someone like [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2717.36s)]
*  Ampere said it's Judea and Samaria, he then said there is no occupation. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2726.48s)]
*  So he imposed a different sphere of reality. And when I heard this, my first reaction was, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2733.84s)]
*  you know, so who's that pointing a gun at me every day I go to drive my kids to school? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2742.08s)]
*  Am I delusional that there is an Israeli soldier? You say there is no occupation. Am I delusional [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2748.3199999999997s)]
*  that there's, you know, literally a military checkpoint outside of our town? Or, you know, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2754.08s)]
*  he is living in this delusional, created, imagined sphere of reality from the Bible, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2762.3199999999997s)]
*  and he is reading everything through that lens. And let's be clear, it's not like he's using the [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2769.52s)]
*  Bible to put on ethical moral lenses to read a conflict with and try to be fair and call for [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2776.56s)]
*  righteousness and peacemaking. No, that's irrelevant. The teachings of Jesus become completely irrelevant. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2785.92s)]
*  What matters is this, you know, way of pre-Screed scripture in which they offset nations from [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2792.4s)]
*  thousands of years ago into today, and it's exciting to them, you know, especially when some [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2798.56s)]
*  of them link it to the second coming of Christ. All of this happens when you call it Judea and [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2804.4s)]
*  Samaria and eliminate completely the Palestinian narrative or the Palestinian existence we exist [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2810.96s)]
*  on this land. Well, we don't, do we really even know where Judea and Samaria was? I mean, it's, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2818.48s)]
*  those are very imprecise archaeological terms, I believe, certainly does not correspond probably [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2824.8s)]
*  to the borders of the West Bank. I want to talk a little bit about Christian Zionism. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2834.0s)]
*  It didn't call itself Christian Zionism, but it actually predates, certainly began at the end of [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2845.1200000000003s)]
*  the 19th century. It was all sorts of figures, and just by the way, in terms of the settler colonial [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2850.32s)]
*  project that Israel carried out against the Palestinians and attempting to use the Bible [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2858.8s)]
*  to justify it, that's exactly what the Puritans did in New England when they carried out the [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2864.2400000000002s)]
*  genocide against indigenous communities in the Americas. They went to the Bible and branded them [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2869.84s)]
*  as satanic and talked about building the city on the hill. So it was, again, it was the appropriation [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2876.88s)]
*  of the Bible to carry out genocide in the United States, what became the United States, a very [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2884.6400000000003s)]
*  similar process that we're seeing in Israel. But let's talk about Christian Zionism because with the [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2890.0s)]
*  following way of support for the Zionist state by younger Jews, the government has catered more and [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2895.52s)]
*  more to these Christian Zionists, Hague and others. You come out of the evangelical tradition, I do not, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2902.56s)]
*  so you probably are more in touch with it. I wrote a book about the American, or the Christian [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2910.88s)]
*  right called American Fascists, the Christian right in the war in America. I believe that they are [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2917.44s)]
*  heretics who, I don't think Jesus came to make us rich, or I don't think Jesus blessed the white race [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2921.6s)]
*  above other races, or these people were very involved in sacralizing the war in wars in Iraq [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2928.56s)]
*  and Afghanistan with the demonization of Muslims. So I'm very fierce in terms of these people. But [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2936.56s)]
*  let's get your take on Christian Zionists because they've become cheerleaders for the genocide, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2943.6s)]
*  for the most part. Unfortunately, and in their lust for power, they see Israel as a natural ally. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2948.56s)]
*  And let's remember that the influence of evangelicals on events here on the ground is old. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2958.56s)]
*  It's from the 80s at least when during the Reagan era, the rise of the religious right and [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2968.56s)]
*  you know the history. And then we saw another rise during the Trump first presidency and already [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2978.72s)]
*  you were beginning to sense that there will be yet another wave of those evangelicals rising to [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2985.36s)]
*  power. And you know, as I said, in their lust to power, they are willing to drive the whole region [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2991.6800000000003s)]
*  into madness. Thank God nothing happened when the embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=2998.08s)]
*  then Trump said, I did it for the evangelicals. And again, when evangelicals support such a move, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3005.84s)]
*  they base it entirely on what I said. You know, the Bible said, so it's Jewish land. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3014.16s)]
*  It's the supremacy of the Judeo-Christian tradition. And they want to impose it on [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3020.48s)]
*  everyone else. It doesn't matter to them what the international law or UN resolutions say. They are [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3026.24s)]
*  all irrelevant to them. What matters is how it's not what the Bible says. It's their interpretation [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3031.8399999999997s)]
*  of the Bible. And this sense of, as I said, the sense of supremacy comes also in how they look [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3037.44s)]
*  at people who are different than them. You know, let's remember that. And as much as I still value [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3044.32s)]
*  many things in the evangelical tradition, I think it's important to call these attitudes of prejudice [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3049.52s)]
*  to call them out. And at the end of the day, you know, when talking to Christian Zionists or when [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3057.04s)]
*  evaluating Christian Zionism, there are multiple ways on doing it. There is, of course, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3063.52s)]
*  I'm a theologian, so let's read the Bible. Does the Bible say so? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3072.88s)]
*  Does the Bible really call us to support a Jewish state today? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3078.24s)]
*  And then there's also the other question, does it matter? In other words, is it relevant? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3085.28s)]
*  How we read scripture texts like Genesis 12, I will bless those who bless you and so is it [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3093.6s)]
*  is this how we resolve issues today by looking at religious texts and trying to decide [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3100.8s)]
*  to whom did God promise the land? And many times when I speak to evangelicals, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3108.16s)]
*  honestly, I say, are you are you listening to yourselves? Show me one other context in which [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3112.08s)]
*  you solve something by bringing a religious text and asking the question to whom did the [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3118.8s)]
*  deity promise this piece of land? I mean, if we applied in any other context, we will be called [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3124.08s)]
*  back-minded and, you know, out of, you know, that we, you know, weird and don't make any sense. But [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3130.16s)]
*  somehow here it becomes normal that we are willing to ignore history, people who lived in this land. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3136.8s)]
*  So I keep telling evangelicals, are you really listening to yourselves when you use the Bible [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3143.04s)]
*  for what's happening today? And I think it's also finally important [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3149.2799999999997s)]
*  when we talk about Christian Zionism to highlight that actually it's an oxymoron. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3155.52s)]
*  This is why, because what is Zionism and what did Zionism produce? And we need to be [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3161.6s)]
*  honest about the nature of Zionism and the fruits of Zionism. You know, Jesus said, you shall know [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3169.28s)]
*  from their fruits, you shall know them. Zionism from its, by its definition, creating a homeland [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3177.1200000000003s)]
*  for the Jewish people in Palestine necessitates the ethnic cleansing of Palestine because [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3184.2400000000002s)]
*  Palestine was not empty. So you want to create a homeland. It's not about going to Palestine to [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3189.6000000000004s)]
*  seek refuge. Just remember that. Zionism is not that. Zionism is we want to create a homeland [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3193.92s)]
*  on someone else's land. So, and the Zionist leader were clear. There's a problem in Palestine in that [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3199.6s)]
*  it's inhabited. I think someone used the metaphor, Palestine is this beautiful bride, but it's taken. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3205.52s)]
*  So by definition, Zionism means the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3212.8s)]
*  By definition, then what happened, you know, on practice is that Zionism created a safe state that [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3217.28s)]
*  discriminates against the Palestinians. Today we have a system of apartheid. Today we have a [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3225.68s)]
*  genocide. So when you look at all of this, and we need to ask, can we put the word Christian before [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3231.6s)]
*  all of this? And for that matter, can we put the word Jewish before all of this? This is why groups [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3238.08s)]
*  like Jewish Voice for Peace now are very clear in that they oppose Zionism because it's, they say, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3244.7999999999997s)]
*  we stand for freedom, equality, and human rights, and Zionism is identical of that. Zionism is [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3251.4399999999996s)]
*  opposed to all of that. I think it's important to be critical and call things by name. Zionism [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3256.9599999999996s)]
*  is ethnic cleansing and racism and colonial. This is what Zionism is. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3266.64s)]
*  I don't see how some people still try to romanticize Zionism, and I actually don't see a future for [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3273.84s)]
*  Palestinians and Israelis in this time together. If we truly hope to reach a day in which we share [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3281.12s)]
*  the land with an ideology like Zionism, it doesn't work. It only leads to violence, destruction, and [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3287.36s)]
*  the current result that we are in. And in this formula, the powerful wins, sadly, and it's the [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3296.88s)]
*  innocent people from both sides, but right now, especially from the Palestinians who pay the price. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3305.6s)]
*  Well, it also requires vast historical amnesia. What is it, seven centuries of historic Palestine [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3312.56s)]
*  has been dominated by Muslim rulers of the Ottomans and others, but you have to erase [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3321.44s)]
*  centuries and centuries of history and go back to a document that, in the case of [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3332.32s)]
*  the Hebrew Bible, was written, what, 4,000 years ago? But it does require historical amnesia. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3338.8s)]
*  Absolutely, and archaeology comes to aid. And if you want an illustration of all of this, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3345.04s)]
*  just look at the whole industry of pilgrimage, biblical tourism. Because you have millions, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3353.84s)]
*  before COVID and before this war, coming to the Holy Land, as they call it, and going on a whole [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3359.44s)]
*  tour on sites that only existed in biblical times. The whole tour is designed as if to tell you that [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3367.04s)]
*  nothing exists in Palestine. There is nothing to see besides the biblical sites and the fact that [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3374.64s)]
*  Palestine was a desert and Israel turned into a garden of Eden. They don't visit beautiful sites, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3382.56s)]
*  beautiful pieces of history, including, interestingly, Byzantine churches and all [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3389.12s)]
*  the pieces of art, Islamic art, Christian art. All of this is eliminated. And you come and visit [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3395.6s)]
*  the Holy Land and get the impression that it was empty for 2,000 years. Jesus came here and then [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3405.2799999999997s)]
*  we walk in his footsteps by going to Galilee. And of course, you're not walking in Jesus' footsteps [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3414.72s)]
*  of all. You walk in Jesus' footsteps when you spend time with people, care for the poor, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3419.52s)]
*  or the malnourished, preach the Kingdom of God. They do none of that. Instead, they jump from place [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3424.08s)]
*  to place, which again gives the impression that Palestine was empty for 2,000 years. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3431.04s)]
*  Nothing happened from the biblical times until today. Israel came to revive it and gave us the [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3436.24s)]
*  opportunity finally to visit the places where Jesus lived. And this Palestinian theologian, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3441.6s)]
*  said the Palestinians, and particularly the Palestinian Christians, were replaced by the [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3451.8399999999997s)]
*  state of Israel. And today in the minds of most Christians, when you think of the land, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3456.3199999999997s)]
*  of the biblical land, the Holy Land, the first thing that comes to mind is Israel and the Jewish [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3464.48s)]
*  people, not the Palestinians, and surely not the Palestinian Christians who lived here and survived [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3469.04s)]
*  for 2,000 years, who kept those sites for you, who kept the Christian presence so that now you can [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3473.68s)]
*  come and totally ignore that we actually exist on this land. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3479.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean also, you know, archaeology by Israeli archaeologists is weaponized, so they will [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3486.3199999999997s)]
*  destroy layers upon layers of civilization in order to dig down to find the remnants of [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3493.2s)]
*  a synagogue or a Jewish community and discard the rest. I want to talk about what's happened [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3499.2799999999997s)]
*  to religious sites in Gaza. 80% of the mosques have been destroyed. And also what's happened [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3504.72s)]
*  to the Christian community, we should note that Palestinian Christians, not surprisingly, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3513.04s)]
*  are the oldest Christian community in the world. They destroyed that Greek Orthodox, the Israelis, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3517.12s)]
*  Greek Orthodox Church in Gaza. They have the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, the slow, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3525.92s)]
*  let's call it the slow motion ethnic cleansing of Palestinians before the genocide, has seen the [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3534.64s)]
*  Christian community. I think a few decades ago, Bethlehem was about 85% Christian. I don't know [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3541.92s)]
*  what it is now, but probably 20, you know, probably about 20% or something. But yeah, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3549.36s)]
*  so there's been an assault against Palestinian Christians. They have not, the Israelis have been [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3554.96s)]
*  as fierce against them as they have against Palestinian Muslims. And I think like you, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3562.4s)]
*  I mean one of the things that's been so disturbing about the genocide in Gaza is the way they have [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3568.88s)]
*  targeted religious institutions for destruction. Well, everybody's a target in this war and [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3575.28s)]
*  nowhere is safe, no place is safe. Tragically for the Christian community, they thought that [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3582.32s)]
*  church was safe. But not only was the church, the historical church of St. Prophelius [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3588.88s)]
*  bombed, I mean the church itself still exists, but the building adjacent to it- [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3596.48s)]
*  Let me just interrupt you, Monser, for people who don't know. I think this church goes back [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3600.7200000000003s)]
*  to the fourth century, is that correct? Fifth century. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3604.2400000000002s)]
*  Fifth century. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3607.36s)]
*  So not only was, you know, it was targeted. Thankfully the church itself still exists, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3608.16s)]
*  but the building adjacent to it fell on it. And it's now, you know, it collapsed, but it's, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3613.2799999999997s)]
*  the historic church is holding it. 18 people were killed in that bombing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3620.7999999999997s)]
*  And also in the neighboring church, the Catholic church, which is more recent, recently a bit, but [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3626.0s)]
*  two women were killed by snipers inside the premise of the church, inside the church compound. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3631.6s)]
*  Nowhere is safe. And I think one of the myths of what's been happening in Palestine for the last [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3639.52s)]
*  years or so is that Christians are caught in between, as if, you know, we have nothing to do [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3646.72s)]
*  in this conflict and we're the victims, you know, as just by being bystanders. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3653.2s)]
*  But nothing is, you know, this is not true at all. From 1948, Christians became refugees, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3659.52s)]
*  Christian towns were destroyed, churches were closed. And since then our land is confiscated. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3667.12s)]
*  Many of our people were killed in the different uprisings, the wars and so on. We are Palestinians [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3674.7999999999997s)]
*  and at the end of the day, Israel looks at us as Palestinians. And actually in some cases, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3682.32s)]
*  especially in the old city of Jerusalem, the heads of churches, it's not just me, you know, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3690.2400000000002s)]
*  the heads of churches, the Orthodox, the Catholics, they have spoken, I think three years ago, of [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3696.0800000000004s)]
*  a systematic plan to empty Jerusalem of Christians. They talked about the attacks [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3701.76s)]
*  on Christian sites, the harassments, the incitements against Christian sites and Christian [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3709.2s)]
*  clergy sparing on them and burning churches and so on. So heads of churches in Jerusalem, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3715.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, have used the language that we feel that we are being targeted. The Israeli police [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3722.3999999999996s)]
*  did some measures to try to stop this, but many still look with suspicions on the seriousness of [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3727.2799999999997s)]
*  these efforts to stop these attacks by the religious extreme Jewish groups on Christian [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3733.36s)]
*  sites. So, you know, again, nothing is further than the truth when you say Palestinians are [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3741.76s)]
*  caught in between or as if we have nothing to do with this conflict because we are part of the [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3749.44s)]
*  Palestinian people. We live under apartheid and our siblings in Gaza are going through a genocide. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3756.48s)]
*  And really, our hope right now in this Christmas season is that they survive. We want nothing [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3762.48s)]
*  other than their survival and the rest of Gaza, that hopefully by Christmas this war is over. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3768.32s)]
*  Let's talk about Bethlehem and what the mood is like. I was in the West Bank, I was in Ramallah [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3776.88s)]
*  this summer. Since October 7th, Palestinians who had jobs in Israel have been denied entry. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3783.76s)]
*  The economic situation, especially in depressed areas like the Jenin refugee camp, is dire. I'm [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3793.76s)]
*  talking about shortages of food, water, the bulldozers when they, Israeli bulldozers, when [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3799.76s)]
*  they go in rip up not only the sewer pipes but destroy the electrical grid. What is Bethlehem [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3805.6800000000003s)]
*  like now at Christmas? I actually feel bad talking about Bethlehem giving the fact that there is a [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3811.6s)]
*  genocide in Gaza. And that's the only reason we're not talking about Bethlehem right now is that [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3820.16s)]
*  it's nothing in comparison. But if we assess the situation here, by all means it's the worst we've [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3826.48s)]
*  witnessed in many many years on all levels. We are now almost completely isolated. There are [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3837.6s)]
*  more gates, more checkpoints, roads that are completely blocked. Sometimes they open the gates [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3845.2799999999997s)]
*  certain hours, sometimes we don't know they close them. So going from one place to the other in the [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3850.56s)]
*  West Bank, so leaving Bethlehem to the north to Ramallah or to the south to Hebron, you need to [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3856.64s)]
*  think wise. I mean do I want to go through hours of waiting at checkpoint or not? And in some cases, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3862.4s)]
*  especially in the night, do I want to risk being the target of settlers attack or not? So we feel [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3868.32s)]
*  a strong sense of isolation and fear and anticipation thinking what happened in Gaza, could it be our [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3874.64s)]
*  fate if the world was silent over what happened there? What if the settlers actually do what they [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3882.08s)]
*  are telling us they want to do? So there is this fear and anticipation that caused actually many [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3891.12s)]
*  to leave. And at the same time you mentioned it, the fact that we are cut off Jerusalem, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3897.3599999999997s)]
*  many Palestinians, and remember when I say many Palestinians used to work in Jerusalem, we're [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3905.6s)]
*  still talking about a tiny fraction of the Palestinian people. But even that tiny fraction [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3910.4s)]
*  is no longer able to go and work in Jerusalem. So that has a severe economic consequences [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3916.8s)]
*  on all over the West Bank. But Bethlehem is suffering the most because of tourism. There's [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3923.44s)]
*  no tourism. There's hardly any tourists left in Bethlehem since October 7. Bethlehem depends so [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3930.48s)]
*  much on tourism. So there is so much unemployment. And it feels sad that churches now, most of our [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3938.32s)]
*  work actually has shifted from normal church life into sustaining families, helping people pay fees, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3947.44s)]
*  trying to ask for help from outside so that we can sustain our families. I've never seen it this bad. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3956.6400000000003s)]
*  And at the same time, I've never seen so much despair. And we are witnessing another wave of [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3964.64s)]
*  immigration. Tens of Palestinian Christian families have left the Bethlehem area since October 7. And [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3972.0s)]
*  sadly, it's those who can afford to leave, those who felt that they were able to survive COVID, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3978.48s)]
*  they will not be able to survive another two or three years without tourism. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3984.4s)]
*  And just to close, as a Christian minister, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3989.52s)]
*  how does your faith in this dark moment sustain you? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=3998.32s)]
*  First, we need to continue to fight to keep the faith. It's something I emphasize in my [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4005.12s)]
*  sermon over and over that they can take everything from us, but they cannot take our faith, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4011.7599999999998s)]
*  faith in God and in the goodness of God. It's hard. But I strongly believe it's harder without faith [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4018.0s)]
*  in a just and good God. And when I said that God is under the rubble or Christ is under the rubble, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4027.28s)]
*  I was trying to bring God nearer to us and encourage people not to always think of, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4038.96s)]
*  you know, we want survival, we want to be delivered, we want deliverance, but oftentimes God is [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4046.0s)]
*  experienced in the midst of pain. It's Christmas season and I'm reminded of the meaning of the word [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4052.88s)]
*  Jesus. One of the names of Jesus is Emmanuel God with us. This takes us to where we began. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4061.92s)]
*  It's not simply that God is in my heart, but it's Emmanuel God with us in the midst of injustice, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4068.56s)]
*  in the midst of oppression. God with us when the Holy Family became refugees in Egypt, or God with [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4076.32s)]
*  us when the Holy Family had to leave Nazareth and come to Bethlehem for census and taxation and so [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4084.2400000000002s)]
*  on. So it's God with us when we go through checkpoints, God with us when we feel the sense [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4092.0s)]
*  of despair and that we are isolated and left as if abandoned. Christmas gives also the sense of hope [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4098.08s)]
*  because it's God's visitation to us. I always say Jesus was born on our side of the world. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4111.52s)]
*  You know, I see something in this and I'm talking about the physical world and beyond the [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4118.96s)]
*  psychological and spiritual worlds that exist between the world and Palestinians that are [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4125.76s)]
*  embodied in this ugly physical world that separates us from the rest of the world. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4130.24s)]
*  And I say there is meaning in the fact that Jesus was born on our side of the world, whether 2000 [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4134.56s)]
*  years ago or even today. And because of that we have to continue to fight for that faith. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4141.04s)]
*  And it's this faith that enables us to survive and to have hope. Because without this, I think, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4149.68s)]
*  I don't think we can survive, honestly. Because if death has the final word, if the empire has the [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4160.16s)]
*  final word, if the logic of might is right has the final word, then there is no sense of continuing [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4167.2s)]
*  this life here. Because ultimately it's all in vain. But God has said his word, whether it's [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4174.32s)]
*  Jesus in Christmas or whether it's the resurrection on Easter Sunday, we need to remember this. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4183.84s)]
*  And yeah, it feels dark right now, honestly. It feels on the Saturday of the Easter story and the [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4189.52s)]
*  tomb dark, isolated, with no end in sight. But in the midst of this darkness, we're fighting to keep [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4200.4800000000005s)]
*  the faith, to remember that the final word ultimately belongs to our good God. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4210.8s)]
*  Great, thank you. That was Reverend Munther Isaac. I want to thank Diego, Thomas, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Ktr3kX3tc&t=4217.360000000001s)]
