# The Economics of a Dying Empire (w/ Richard Wolff) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M)
*  The final stages of capitalism, Karl Marx wrote, will be marked by developments that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=0.0s)]
*  are intimately familiar, unable to expand and generate profits at past levels. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=15.46s)]
*  The capitalist system will begin to consume the structures that sustain it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=20.78s)]
*  It will prey upon, in the name of austerity and government efficiency, the working class [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=25.54s)]
*  and the poor, driving them ever deeper into debt and poverty, and diminishing the capacity [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=31.14s)]
*  of the state to serve the needs of ordinary citizens. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=37.019999999999996s)]
*  It will, as it has, increasingly relocate jobs, including both manufacturing and professional [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=40.94s)]
*  positions, to countries with cheap pools of labor. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=47.22s)]
*  Industries will mechanize their workplaces. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  This will trigger an economic assault on not only the working class, but the middle class, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=54.88s)]
*  the bulwark of a capitalist system, that will at first be disguised by the imposition of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  massive personal debt as incomes decline or remain stagnant. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  Politics in the late stages of capitalism will become subordinate to economics, leading [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=71.92s)]
*  to political parties hollowed out of any real political content and abjectly subservient [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=76.6s)]
*  to the dictates of corporations and oligarchs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=83.2s)]
*  But as Marx warned, there is a limit to an economy built on the scaffolding of debt expansion. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=86.68s)]
*  There comes a moment, Marx warned, when there will be no new markets available and no new [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=93.26s)]
*  pools of people who can take on more debt. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Capitalism will then turn on the so-called free market itself, along with the values [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=102.92s)]
*  and traditions it claims to defend. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=107.28s)]
*  It will in its final stages pillage the systems and structures that make capitalism possible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=109.94s)]
*  It will resort as it causes widespread suffering to harsher forms of oppression. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=116.7s)]
*  It will attempt in a frantic last stand to maintain its profits by looting and pillaging [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=121.82s)]
*  state institutions, contradicting its stated nature. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=127.42s)]
*  The final stages of capitalism, as Marx grasped, is not capitalism at all. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=131.46s)]
*  Governments gobble down government expenditures in essence taxpayer money like pigs at a trough. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=138.02s)]
*  Then the system crashes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=144.12s)]
*  Joining me to discuss our late-stage capitalism and what it means for us and the global economy [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=145.86s)]
*  is Professor Richard Wolff. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Professor Wolff is a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=153.86s)]
*  Amherst and a visiting professor in the graduate program in international affairs of the New [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=159.34s)]
*  School. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  He has also taught economics at Yale University, City University of New York, University of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=166.1s)]
*  Utah and the University of Paris. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=171.9s)]
*  So let's talk about late-stage capitalism, the hollowing out of state institutions, Doge, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=175.94s)]
*  and what the capitalists in the short term, of course, are going to make lots of money, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=184.94s)]
*  but what it's going to do to the rest of us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=189.22s)]
*  Well, I think your opening, Chris, as often your openings are, is wonderfully comprehensive. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=193.3s)]
*  It leaves me kind of amazed at how much more I can provide in the way of specifics and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  concreteness. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=209.02s)]
*  I won't be departing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=210.02s)]
*  I think you've captured it really very, very well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=212.06s)]
*  But let me drive some of the points home. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  Part of what you're watching with the Trump administration can be, and in my judgment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=220.66s)]
*  ought to be, understood as a war on the working class at home, but also abroad. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=225.7s)]
*  What is being done—let me start at the opposite end. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=235.22s)]
*  What is being done in Europe is remarkable. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=239.0s)]
*  A deal that came out of World War II in which the United States would defeat the new enemy, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=242.26s)]
*  the Soviet Union, barely a few months after being the great ally. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=249.9s)]
*  It became overnight the great enemy, showing a kind of flexibility which is at once astonishing, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=255.3s)]
*  but also impressive in terms of meeting your own needs and rearranging the pieces on the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=262.46s)]
*  board that you're playing with. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=268.82s)]
*  The deal that was made was the following. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=271.38s)]
*  We the United States, we have two big worries right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=274.7s)]
*  For one, the New Deal. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=279.1s)]
*  An awful lot of money was taxed or borrowed from rich corporations and the wealthy people [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=281.3s)]
*  to provide a remarkable array of mass services—unemployment insurance, a minimum wage, the Social Security [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=288.3s)]
*  system, government employment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=298.42s)]
*  This had to be rolled back. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=301.76000000000005s)]
*  As you know very well, our last 50 years are the story of the rollback of that New Deal. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=304.26s)]
*  But it also required smashing the Socialists and Communists who had created that New Deal [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=311.9s)]
*  with their alliance for a while with the Democratic Party. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=319.9s)]
*  All of that had to be undone and was undone. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=323.46s)]
*  The second great anxiety at the end of the war was that we would fall back into a depression. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=328.5s)]
*  Let's remember it was only the war that finally got us out of the horrible collapse of capitalism, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=334.22s)]
*  the worst in its history, from 1929 to 1940-41. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=341.62s)]
*  Only by taking the remaining many, many millions of people, putting—I'm going to be simple [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=347.86s)]
*  now—putting half of them in uniform and the other half making the uniforms, we were [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=353.70000000000005s)]
*  able—and then the great worry, and it was very serious. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=358.26000000000005s)]
*  At the end of the war, 1945, what would now happen? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=362.94s)]
*  We would demobilize all these people out of the military, out of producing for the military. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=367.38s)]
*  What would prevent us from slipping back? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=374.9s)]
*  You can see the government did extraordinary things—the GI Bill—to take all those soldiers [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=378.34s)]
*  and instead of having them go into their unemployment, stick them in the university where the government [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=384.9s)]
*  would pay for it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=389.86s)]
*  The housing program, the highway program, all of them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=391.06s)]
*  But what people don't recognize was that there was another part of this, and that was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=394.26s)]
*  the international part with Europe. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=399.34s)]
*  The problem was Europe had the same depression history as this country did, and during that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=402.42s)]
*  time, as in the United States, socialist and communist parties became much stronger than [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=408.86s)]
*  they had ever been in Europe. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=415.38s)]
*  So at the end of the war, you had the worry about slipping back, but you had an even bigger [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=418.06s)]
*  one that you had very strong socialist and communist parties who had led the movement [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=423.26s)]
*  of the 1930s to get social services, which were much more generous in Europe than they [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=429.94s)]
*  were in this country. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=435.96s)]
*  Plus, the socialists and communists provided the militants who were the anti-fascist resistance. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=437.46s)]
*  So they were popular, they were strong. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=443.74s)]
*  De Gaulle's first government after 1945 had to have Communist Party people in the cabinet [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=446.62s)]
*  for Italy. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=453.18s)]
*  The second biggest party in the 20 years after the war was the Italian Communist Party, and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=454.18s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=459.46000000000004s)]
*  And they all had the Soviet Union literally a few hours by train from them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  So their capitalist classes were even more freaked out about what was going on than the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  alliance with the Soviet Union. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=473.42s)]
*  It was all too much. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=475.38s)]
*  So what the United States did is cut a deal. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=476.94s)]
*  We will solve our economic problem by putting Keynesianism on steroids. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=481.36s)]
*  The government is going to come in and do what? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=487.9s)]
*  Save us from the Soviet menace, build up the military industrial, and say to the Europeans, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=491.38s)]
*  we'll take care of it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=497.7s)]
*  We'll provide you with the defense umbrella, we'll divide you with all the support, and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=499.66s)]
*  all you have to do is make sure you crush the socialists and communists at home, and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=505.94s)]
*  you are a good bulwark against the Soviet Union. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=513.14s)]
*  And to that end, here's what we're going to do. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=516.78s)]
*  You won't have to cover defense. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=520.4200000000001s)]
*  We're taking care of that with our domestic Keynesian, military Keynesianism. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=522.4200000000001s)]
*  And you're going to take the money you would have had to spend to provide the social services [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=527.94s)]
*  that will allow you to compete with what the Russians are offering their people, and had [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=534.62s)]
*  been already for quite a while at that time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=538.94s)]
*  So you're going to compete with them, and then we're going to take our National Endowment [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=541.9000000000001s)]
*  for Democracy, our CIA, and all the rest, and make sure the right politicians willing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=546.3000000000001s)]
*  to commit to this deal sit at the top of the government in France, in Germany, in Britain, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=553.38s)]
*  and we all know the story of all of the money and the sloshing that was done. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=559.42s)]
*  That was it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=564.62s)]
*  And that was the way we were going to destroy the socialists and communists inside, and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=565.62s)]
*  weaken or destroy, if we could, the one outside, and all of it justifying the massive government [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=572.82s)]
*  spending. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=580.86s)]
*  But the problem is, all of that was paid for, to touch on your point, by debt. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=582.18s)]
*  The United States does not like to fight wars with taxes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=588.02s)]
*  It likes to fight wars with money borrowed, because if you tax the people, the opposition [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=591.62s)]
*  to the war would be much bigger and arise much sooner. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=597.14s)]
*  So you can't do that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=601.2199999999999s)]
*  You borrow the money. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=602.9399999999999s)]
*  Here's the irony. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=604.5s)]
*  The Europeans were major lenders for a while to the United States to fund the Keynesianism [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=605.68s)]
*  that protected them from having to use their money for their own defense. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=612.5999999999999s)]
*  The ironies of how this all fit together are a charming story that's never quite been put [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=616.8s)]

*  What we have now is the collapse of that deal. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=625.68s)]
*  It's very important historically, and I know you do the history too, Chris, something we [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=631.48s)]
*  have in common, which I think is part of whatever effect we have. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=636.84s)]
*  The story, it fits together our situation coming out of World War II, and working out [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=641.12s)]
*  this way for another lease on life, with lots of domestic government spending. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=648.52s)]
*  But the problem is so much of it was done on debt, and so much of it was done without [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=654.8s)]
*  understanding the special moment. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  The United States had no competitor coming out of World War II. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, they were all destroyed. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=669.5999999999999s)]
*  We came out king of the hill. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=676.16s)]
*  Our economy was in better shape coming out of the war than it was going in, and no one [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=677.8399999999999s)]
*  else could say that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=682.8399999999999s)]
*  The result was a very bizarre, unique, special moment that could not possibly last. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=684.6s)]
*  I think historians will look back, be rather impressed it lasted as long as it did. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=693.4s)]
*  But in any case, it is now over. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=698.84s)]
*  You can't do it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=702.44s)]
*  The United States lost the war in Vietnam. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=704.44s)]
*  It lost it in Iraq. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  It's losing it in Ukraine. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=708.48s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=710.64s)]
*  These are among the poorest countries on earth, to which the US is losing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=711.64s)]
*  And the Europeans are left in a way one almost has to sympathize. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=717.28s)]
*  They're irrelevant. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=724.16s)]
*  They've become not the literal opposite of what they were three or four centuries ago. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=725.16s)]
*  The center of the universe, the apogee of culture, the colonial master, all of that. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=731.68s)]
*  It's all gone. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=737.68s)]
*  It's a footnote. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=740.84s)]
*  Living in a world of fantasy where being unable to stop the Russians with the United States, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=743.12s)]
*  they actually think that they're going to do it without the United States. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=750.1s)]
*  These are levels of craziness that are part of the decline, I suspect, of all empires [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=757.14s)]
*  when they consume themselves. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=764.64s)]
*  At this point, I am particularly struck with this crazy business of attacking federal employees [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=767.4s)]
*  in the name of efficiency. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  That is so laughable that one has to kind of take a deep breath, because it's sort [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=780.12s)]
*  of overwhelming what you get here. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=786.56s)]
*  Two and a half million civilian employees of the federal government versus five million [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  working for state government and 15 million working for the local government. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  If you care to damn about efficiency, or whatever that exactly means, your obvious targets would [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=802.24s)]
*  be local and state, but they can't get at those, so they go after the federal. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=808.6800000000001s)]
*  That's not a decision of efficiency. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=813.96s)]
*  That's a decision of where can we make a public performance, and they're making a public [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=816.28s)]
*  performance. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  It ruins the lives of those people. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  It destroys whatever function these agencies often had. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=825.28s)]
*  It drives people entering the labor force, which is a larger number than those leaving [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=829.18s)]
*  the federal. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=835.1999999999999s)]
*  They're all going to go into the private sector, where they're going to bid down wages. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=836.28s)]
*  At the same time that they can't control the inflation, you're ripping up your working [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=840.8s)]
*  class more and more and more, as if there were no end to this process. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=845.4s)]
*  These are the desperate behaviors of a dying empire. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  There's really no other framework that I can think of that makes sense of this. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=857.6s)]
*  Well, aren't they trying to essentially destroy government agencies, like the Postal Service, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=864.0799999999999s)]
*  for instance, education, because they privatize it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=870.48s)]
*  They make money off it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=874.84s)]
*  They live in a world. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=876.36s)]
*  Look, I'm part of it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=877.84s)]
*  I've been a professor of economics all my life. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=878.84s)]
*  I grew up in that framework. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=881.88s)]
*  I had to learn all of that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=883.44s)]
*  I had to teach it often. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=885.48s)]
*  They live in a framework governed by the theory of economics, their theory, which says that [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=888.52s)]
*  — and I mean this as blunt and as religious sounding in the negative sense of the term [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  as I can make it — they live in a world in which whatever the private sector does [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=903.9s)]
*  is efficient, more so than any other way of getting the job done. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=910.4s)]
*  And anything that you can do to reduce the economic footprint of the government, thereby [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=916.84s)]
*  shifting the work over to the private sector, will be an increase in efficiency from which [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=922.8s)]
*  all of us will benefit. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=929.92s)]
*  They actually believe — it's like listening to a plantation owner in Louisiana in 1832 [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=932.42s)]
*  explaining how and why master and slave is the best possible arrangement for the human [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  race to accomplish what it needs to produce. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=948.9399999999999s)]
*  It's just — it's so obvious. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=952.5799999999999s)]
*  It's just beyond needing to be explained. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=955.06s)]
*  Yeah, you have these people. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=958.26s)]
*  It's a small business mentality. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=960.6s)]
*  I can do it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=962.88s)]
*  I'm doing it real well. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=963.88s)]
*  If only the government rules and regulations weren't there, and if all the bad people [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=965.46s)]
*  that intervene in the free market, which is our modern religious icon, well then — yeah, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=971.48s)]
*  they actually — to the degree that they are governed by any theoretical awareness [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=979.4s)]
*  at all, it is a simple-minded version of that simplistic mantra, which, you know, you [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=984.3s)]
*  and I know, I went to the fanciest schools this country has, and that's what they taught [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=992.88s)]
*  us. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=997.9s)]
*  But it's dynamiting the very foundations that makes a capitalist system work. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=999.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, the infrastructure's collapsing. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1005.9s)]
*  You don't educate your population. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1010.76s)]
*  We still see what a privatized social service — postal service has done in England. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1012.38s)]
*  It's a mess. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1019.18s)]
*  It doesn't work. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1020.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, from that introduction, aren't they — perhaps unwittingly — aren't they actually [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1022.54s)]
*  destroying the very structures that makes the accumulation of wealth in the long term [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1028.3s)]
*  possible? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1034.62s)]
*  Here's the way I understand it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1035.62s)]
*  They had that ideology that the private sector is the efficient — they've been believing [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1040.22s)]
*  that for 200 years, if not longer. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1045.24s)]
*  You know, it has many names — liberalism, neoliberalism, laissez-faire — lots of language [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1048.42s)]
*  for the same basic idea. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1056.22s)]
*  But they were always — and this is the way I understand it — they were always counteracted, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1059.42s)]
*  to some extent, by sort of practical men and women who said to them, wait a minute, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1066.22s)]
*  yet maybe, but if we don't solve this problem real quick, and the only agency that's going [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1072.8600000000001s)]
*  to do that is the government, we are going to be in deep trouble. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1078.98s)]
*  You know, we turn to the government to run the military when we're attacked because [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1083.3s)]
*  the private — and then they will make a break. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1090.02s)]
*  They will do what Roosevelt ended up doing in the 1930s. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1095.02s)]
*  They'll intervene in the labor market. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1099.3s)]
*  There's a minimum wage. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1102.54s)]
*  We don't care what market forces are. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1103.94s)]
*  You don't go below that. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1105.94s)]
*  And I want to remind people, even the conservatives had those. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1106.94s)]
*  When the inflation was unmanageable in 1971, Nixon goes on the radio and television, 15th [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1111.54s)]
*  of August, 1971, and says, I am freezing all wages and prices in the United States. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1119.54s)]
*  As of tomorrow morning, if you raise your price, Mr. Businessman, we're going to come, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1126.6599999999999s)]
*  we're going to arrest you, and you're going to jail. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1132.1399999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1135.54s)]
*  Okay, this is a kind of recognition. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1136.54s)]
*  If you have the space — what we have now is a population increasingly persuaded, right [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1139.94s)]
*  up to the top, that there is no space. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1147.18s)]
*  You can't afford the apparent solution of the government. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1151.18s)]
*  You've got to do something. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1156.8200000000002s)]
*  And the only thing they can think of, given the narrowness of our education, is that fantasy. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1159.38s)]
*  They're going to save America by going backwards. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1165.3400000000001s)]
*  What in the world is that? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1170.42s)]
*  Go back to what? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1171.42s)]
*  Whatever it is that got you here. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1173.42s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1175.62s)]
*  And what they're doing is they're living out the fantasy. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1176.62s)]
*  I would guess in other empires, as they declined, they began to appeal to their gods, to their [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1181.06s)]
*  fetishes, to their fantasies, because they had nothing practically workable left. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1189.2199999999998s)]
*  We are borrowed up to here with our $35 trillion of national debt. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1196.3999999999999s)]
*  It's way above our national GDP, which is not supposed to be — that used to be considered [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1201.66s)]
*  a no-no line. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1206.94s)]

*  How is that all going to play out economically? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1291.02s)]
*  Are they really — can they leave the military industrial complex alone because there's a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1293.94s)]
*  bill in Congress pushed by the Republicans to increase military spending by $100 billion [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1300.98s)]
*  over the next decade. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1306.34s)]
*  If they're not going to touch the military, which consumes half of all discretionary spending, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1308.22s)]
*  I don't see how they're going to save that much money, first of all. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  And second of all, with these economic policies that cater to the oligarchic class, what are [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1315.58s)]
*  going to be the ramifications of that economically? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1325.06s)]
*  Well, I think what you're seeing in part — let's start with the tariffs — there's [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1327.5s)]
*  something that's important about the tariffs that doesn't get the attention it ought to. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1334.3s)]
*  If I read American politics correctly, then for at least the last hundred years, the Republican [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1339.5s)]
*  Party's major mantra has been either we're going to cut your taxes or we're not going [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1345.98s)]
*  to raise your taxes. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1352.66s)]
*  We are the anti-tax party, and they go to every part of the population they can to sell [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1354.72s)]
*  that story. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1361.26s)]
*  A tariff is a tax. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1363.22s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1365.86s)]
*  It's a tax on imported objects that are produced elsewhere and sold here. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1366.86s)]
*  In the early days of American history, these were called import duties because that's what [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1372.2199999999998s)]
*  they are. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1377.3s)]
*  Calling them a tariff — [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1378.3s)]
*  Didn't we start a revolution over that? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1379.3s)]
*  Yes, among other things. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1381.34s)]
*  That's right, because we weren't allowed to put them on us. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1383.06s)]
*  King George III made that decision. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1387.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1389.74s)]
*  Here we have an anti-tax party whose major economic weapon, as of Mr. Trump, is a tariff. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1391.74s)]
*  It's kind of a — there's more evidence that something is really breaking down because [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1401.38s)]
*  they have to become advocates of the very thing they claimed in principle they were [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1408.02s)]
*  against. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1416.1s)]
*  Every bizarre — the same people out of whose mouth on the 4th of July comes anti-tax. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1417.74s)]
*  BS are now telling you about what a wonderful weapon the tariff is. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1424.74s)]
*  The reason Mr. Trump uses it, by the way, is that Congress gave the president a lot [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1431.3s)]
*  of leeway about doing that, and so he can do it, and so he can play the role Mr. Trump [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1436.18s)]
*  likes to play — you know, the angry god with his weapons. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1441.54s)]
*  And he couldn't do that with many other weapons because they have to go through the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1446.22s)]
*  Congress or through various procedures other than him just spouting off on truth, social, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1449.9s)]
*  how he's going to do this or that, do it today, cancel it tomorrow — all this bizarre [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1458.14s)]
*  theatric. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1464.54s)]
*  He's doing it because he can do it with that. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1466.58s)]
*  There is no principle behind it, number one. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1469.46s)]
*  You cannot know — and there's, by the way, tariffs are very old. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1473.7s)]
*  There's nothing new. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1478.18s)]
*  Countries have been throwing tariffs against each other for centuries. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1479.6200000000001s)]
*  Why do I tell you this? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1484.42s)]
*  Because it's an immense literature. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1485.74s)]
*  I've had to teach courses in international economics. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1488.26s)]
*  That's where that literature is. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1491.82s)]
*  The students spend three weeks going through articles and books, etc., etc. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1493.5s)]
*  All right, so here's what we know. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1499.34s)]
*  We know that a tariff cannot — you cannot tell people what a tariff will do. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1502.54s)]
*  The reason is a tariff sets off a whole series of reactions. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1509.74s)]
*  You can't know them in advance. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1516.78s)]
*  In other words, everyone affected by a tariff has to make a choice about how they're going [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1519.22s)]
*  to respond. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1524.46s)]
*  They will all respond, but how they do it, it's like knowing in advance the chess move. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1525.62s)]
*  You have some probabilities, maybe, but you never know. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1531.94s)]
*  The genius is the one who adjusts. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1535.94s)]
*  So when Mr. Trump tells you the tariffs will do X, this is snake oil. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1538.8200000000002s)]
*  This is nonsense. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1545.8400000000001s)]
*  He doesn't know what that's going to do. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1546.8400000000001s)]
*  In his first statements about the tariff, he thought — he kept saying it — the Chinese [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1550.3400000000001s)]
*  will pay the tariff. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1555.72s)]
*  He had to have his advisors, some of whom I know, had to explain to him. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1557.3s)]
*  And he couldn't get it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1561.5s)]
*  No, the tariff is paid by Americans to the American government. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1562.78s)]
*  The Chinese don't pay any of it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1568.3s)]
*  You can imagine a reaction in China that might — yes, you can, but there's no reason to [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1571.14s)]
*  assume it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1577.92s)]
*  For example, one response to a tariff is a retaliatory tariff. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1579.04s)]
*  Okay, you can't know in advance whether they will do that, and you can't know in advance [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1584.74s)]
*  what products of yours they will impose a tariff again. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1590.6999999999998s)]
*  They don't have to do it across everything. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1595.62s)]
*  Europe is busy taxing bourbon whiskey, and so are the Chinese, for obvious political [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1598.4599999999998s)]
*  reasons because it impacts Mr. Trump's economic base. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1604.3s)]
*  But we don't know. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1609.3799999999999s)]
*  If Canada cannot sell its electricity into the United States, well, then they're going [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1610.8999999999999s)]
*  to sell it to China. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1616.8999999999999s)]
*  Is that really an advantage? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1618.3999999999999s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1620.42s)]
*  Is that a possibility? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1622.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes! [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1624.46s)]
*  In other words, the minute you understand what's going on, all you have for Mr. Trump [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1625.46s)]
*  and his associates is blather. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1631.98s)]
*  What looks good on the evening news, we're going to do this, and it's going to have [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1635.76s)]
*  that result. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1640.3400000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what he can't do. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1641.3400000000001s)]
*  Nobody can do that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1643.22s)]
*  And even a passing awareness, if you're not a paid huckster, is you would say, well, this [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1644.86s)]
*  is going to hurt the relationship. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1652.6999999999998s)]
*  It's going to lead to a lot of rethinking and choices among optional—and how they [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1654.58s)]
*  all add up and impact on us. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1661.3799999999999s)]
*  The only honest answer is I don't know. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1664.9799999999998s)]
*  But isn't, ostensibly, aren't tariffs being imposed on the Canadians and others? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1667.6999999999998s)]
*  One, to kickstart American manufacturing, and two, fill the gap of the tax cuts. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1673.78s)]
*  Is that the ostensible reason for tariffs? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1680.26s)]
*  Yes, that's the kind of thing you say. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1682.62s)]
*  But that implies the pretense that you know that the line of causation will go from your [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1684.74s)]
*  tariff to that decision. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1691.9399999999998s)]
*  For example, an automaker relocating the assembly plant from Mexico into Texas, or something [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1694.52s)]
*  like that. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1703.1s)]
*  Yeah, but here's the problem. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1704.1s)]
*  It is very expensive to move production facilities. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  They take years to establish, and they take almost as much time to relocate. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1710.02s)]
*  And it is very expensive. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1716.3s)]
*  No one, no businessman or woman I have ever talked to about this, would ever make a decision [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1719.34s)]
*  because country A imposes a tariff. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1726.8999999999999s)]
*  Even more so if that country were to behave in such a way as to say the tariff is temporary. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1731.82s)]
*  The tariff is why? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1740.74s)]
*  Because who knew? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1742.82s)]

*  Spend billions, move your Ford plant from Oaxaca to Cincinnati, and then at the end [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1745.62s)]
*  of three years discover that the rationale is gone because this crazy president has decided [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1753.26s)]
*  to go bother somebody else with a tariff. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1759.58s)]
*  You're then out of fortune of money, and then you really lose because if you come to the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1762.74s)]
*  United States, which he always neglects to tell you, you have to pay a lot more money [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1767.82s)]
*  in wages on top of the cost of the move. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1773.1799999999998s)]
*  The intrinsic cost that an accountant in a multinational corporation will sit down and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1778.74s)]
*  tell the CEO, this is what this is going to cost you. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1784.48s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons the CEOs are very unhappy. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1788.66s)]
*  I monitor a CEO program at Yale. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1793.98s)]
*  The way Yale panders to CEOs, it brings them there, puts them in the lovely old colonial [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1798.3000000000002s)]
*  building, wines and dines them and sends them off on their way, and lo and behold, contributions [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1803.8200000000002s)]
*  come to Yale a few months later. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1809.74s)]
*  But in any case, it's a nice sounding board. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1811.98s)]
*  I like to pay attention. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1815.14s)]
*  They are all afraid of saying anything publicly because Mr. Trump is punitive, but with the [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1816.66s)]

*  at Yale about they don't want any of this. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1831.3400000000001s)]
*  They don't want the uncertainty above all else. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1836.1000000000001s)]
*  They can't make decisions. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1839.26s)]
*  And so, by the way, that's one of the reasons we see worries now about recession. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1842.12s)]
*  That's not about anything other than there's such a massive realization in the corporate [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1847.2399999999998s)]
*  sector that we have no idea what this clown is going to do next. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1854.52s)]
*  We can't decide to build a factory, let alone to move one, because we can't figure out where [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1862.2399999999998s)]
*  that ought to be. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1869.1999999999998s)]
*  And making a mistake in this environment is deadly. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1870.66s)]
*  By the way, that introduces another dimension that we haven't spoken about, but which at [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1874.44s)]
*  some point, and maybe on a different occasion, the United States is different now, Chris, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1879.5s)]
*  from what it has been for a century, because we really have an economic competitor. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1886.3400000000001s)]
*  We never had that, as per your own remark at the beginning. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1893.6200000000001s)]
*  The Soviet Union may have been a military problem, but it was never an economic problem. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1897.8s)]
*  It was much too small, much too backward, much too weak, and that's true all the way [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1904.54s)]
*  until it collapsed in 1989. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1910.84s)]
*  It just wasn't. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1913.9199999999998s)]
*  China is. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1915.9199999999998s)]
*  It already is. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1917.44s)]
*  And not to speak of the population, not to speak of the BRICS alliance it has erected. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1919.36s)]
*  Everything is now qualified by the fact that we, the US, have something we did not have [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1926.24s)]
*  before, which is an entire competitive totality. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1934.24s)]
*  China and the BRICS, if you add them up, are over 50% of the world's population. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1941.3999999999999s)]
*  The United States is 4.5%. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1949.56s)]
*  You got to keep this somewhere in your head. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1952.1599999999999s)]
*  What we are talking about here, if you add up the GDP of the G7, the US, Canada, Japan, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1954.72s)]
*  Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, it's about 27%, 28% of the world's output. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1961.72s)]
*  If you add up China and the BRICS, it's 35%. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1967.72s)]
*  It's already a bigger economic unit than we are. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1970.88s)]
*  Every country in Asia, Africa, Latin America, thinking about building a railroad or borrowing [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1974.44s)]
*  money or expanding its medical care, they used to go to New York or Washington or London [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1980.2s)]
*  and get the help thing. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1985.44s)]
*  They still go and they still propose. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1987.04s)]
*  But as soon as that's done, they send the same team to Beijing or New Delhi or Sao Paulo [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1989.68s)]
*  and they're bargaining. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1995.24s)]
*  Who's going to give me the better deal? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1997.24s)]
*  And they're in a better position than we are to do that, which is why the railroads of [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=1999.92s)]
*  Africa are being built by the Chinese and the ports in Latin America and so on. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2005.08s)]

*  The decline of this empire and the rise, I don't know if it's going to be a Chinese empire. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2011.28s)]
*  I don't know if maybe their commitment to multilateralism or nationalism is genuine [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2017.8799999999999s)]
*  or not. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2023.36s)]
*  How can I know? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2024.36s)]
*  But the decline of this one, unmistakable unless you need to deny it, which you and [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  I know is the air we breathe in this country. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2033.72s)]

*  If that happens, that the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency, the empire is [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2048.56s)]
*  impossible to sustain because the Chinese and others won't buy our debt, which is what [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2053.6800000000003s)]

*  Do you agree and do you see that coming? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2060.92s)]
*  I do not agree. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2063.7200000000003s)]
*  And I don't mean to be disrespectful. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2066.64s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2069.36s)]
*  The history of capitalism has always produced people who fetishize one or another aspect. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2072.6800000000003s)]
*  It is a system, and it's as important in the reproduction of that system that the production [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2086.52s)]
*  of goods and services happens in certain ways, that the exchange in markets happen, and that [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2094.2s)]
*  money as the lubricant, if you like, plays the appropriate role. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2102.16s)]
*  All of those things are necessary. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2108.7599999999998s)]
*  Money, the US dollar, very important. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2110.44s)]
*  But the system, like all systems, has within it the capacity to adjust if one or another [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2114.12s)]
*  of the elements... [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2121.2s)]
*  You know, it's a little bit like doctors explain, if you lose your left arm, it turns out your [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2122.2s)]
*  right arm can do a whole ton of things and your body will kind of adjust. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2128.44s)]
*  Yes, you will always know you don't have a left arm, but you will be amazed at what your [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2134.3599999999997s)]
*  right arm can do, or your left eye, or your right eye, or different parts of you. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2140.12s)]
*  It's that way. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2145.2799999999997s)]
*  So it used to be thought that the great evil of capitalism was the banker or the people [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2146.2799999999997s)]
*  with the money. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2152.64s)]
*  Well, they are important, but they are not the beginning and the end any more than anybody [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2153.64s)]
*  else. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2160.08s)]
*  No other part is. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2161.08s)]
*  It's a system. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2162.7999999999997s)]
*  So here's the way I understand it. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2164.16s)]
*  Part of the decline of the empire is a diminution in all of the signs of empire. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2166.8s)]
*  You know, the sign of the British Empire was that the pound sterling was the global currency. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2175.04s)]
*  We now know that the British Empire is a vague, fading memory because nobody cares about the [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2181.5600000000004s)]
*  British pound sterling. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2188.76s)]
*  The British barely do, and nobody else. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2192.2000000000003s)]
*  But to Rick, when they dropped the pound sterling in the 50s as the world's reserve currency, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2195.12s)]
*  Great Britain did go into a recession, a pretty deep recession. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2201.2s)]
*  Economically, it suffered. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2205.16s)]
*  But Britain's decline is a century old. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2207.7599999999998s)]
*  Britain's decline starts in the 19th century, and then is wiped out in World War I and again [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2210.2s)]
*  in World War II. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2216.64s)]
*  It's giving away bits and pieces of its empire as it goes. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2219.64s)]
*  At the end of World War II, it's very famous at Bretton Woods when all the victory countries [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2224.52s)]
*  got together up there in the woods in New Hampshire to decide on the monetary system. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2231.72s)]
*  The British, led by Keynes, at that point the greatest economist in the world, they [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2237.2s)]
*  thought they could reconstruct the pound sterling universe. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2243.24s)]
*  Harry Dexter White, the American equivalent, said to them, looked at them and laughed. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2250.44s)]
*  He said, you know, that's over for you. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2255.8s)]
*  The dollar is going to end. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2258.36s)]
*  And everybody nodded because they all kind of understood, without much argument, that [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2261.36s)]
*  they were part of that process. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2266.48s)]
*  I think the U.S. dollar is shrinking. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2268.6s)]
*  There's easy ways to show it. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2270.88s)]
*  If you look 40 years ago, then central banks around the world kept dollars and gold as [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2273.64s)]
*  their basic two reserves to back up their own currencies. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2281.72s)]
*  And the dollar was often 70, 75, 80, even up above that, percent of those reserves. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2286.7599999999998s)]
*  A little bit of gold, lots of dollars, good as gold. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2293.56s)]
*  Today that number, it's variously estimated, no one knows exactly for sure, but it's in [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2298.04s)]
*  the 40 to 50 percent rate. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2303.12s)]
*  So that's a very dramatic draw. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2304.96s)]
*  It's telling you that for the rest of the world, something very big has changed from [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2308.52s)]
*  what it was in 1945 to now. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2316.2s)]
*  I mean, it's so big and it's so everywhere, and you can see what they're replacing it [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2318.96s)]
*  with. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2324.7599999999998s)]
*  At first it was the euros, then it was the euros and the yen. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2325.7599999999998s)]
*  Now it's the euros, the yen and the yuan from China. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2330.16s)]
*  It's like a subtext translating what we're talking about as a decline. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2334.7999999999997s)]
*  So I see it more as a steady erosion. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2341.08s)]
*  One of the major projects of the BRIC nations, which you can see when you study their reports [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2345.3599999999997s)]
*  when they meet, is to replace the dollar. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2351.96s)]
*  There's no question that they're interested in doing that. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2355.16s)]
*  They are already doing it. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2358.36s)]
*  The decision of Saudi Arabia doesn't get all that much attention here, but they are [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2361.52s)]
*  now willing to sell their oil for a whole variety of currencies before they insisted [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2366.44s)]
*  on the dollar. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2372.54s)]
*  Each of these decisions by itself is limited, but when you add them up, yes, then it's [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2375.0s)]
*  buy-buy the dollar. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2382.76s)]
*  I don't want to overstate it. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2385.48s)]
*  I'm saying it's dying. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2391.84s)]
*  I'm not saying it's dead. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2393.2s)]
*  We are not Britain. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2395.0s)]
*  We are doing what Britain did. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2396.54s)]
*  We are following a lot more than people willing to admit, but we are still several decades [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2399.18s)]
*  before what they have gone through. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2406.32s)]
*  Let's talk about the ramifications of what's happening now, the stripping down of the bureaucratic [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2408.84s)]
*  state, the destruction of social programs, which is going to further immiserate the poor, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2416.1200000000003s)]
*  head start and stuff like that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2425.5600000000004s)]
*  What do you see coming? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2427.36s)]
*  And the kind of chaos. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2428.88s)]
*  Tariffs one day, then the next day we don't have tariffs. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2431.4s)]
*  You can't figure out where this guy's going. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2434.0400000000004s)]
*  What do you see? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2436.84s)]
*  Where are we headed economically? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2440.0s)]
*  Politically, of course, we're becoming fascists, but economically? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2442.04s)]
*  In economics, that's also underway. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2447.2000000000003s)]
*  If fascism, by fascism you mean, and you know it's a very contentious term and people define [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2453.52s)]
*  it differently and all that, but if by classical fascism you mean a kind of merging of the [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2461.28s)]
*  corporate leadership and the governmental apparatus into a situation where the government [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2468.2000000000003s)]
*  is the military enforcement of the rules of capitalism. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2475.0s)]
*  I look at it at Poljanya, you know, that first you get a mafia economy and then you get a [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2481.52s)]
*  mafia state. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2485.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think all of that is very much underway. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2488.12s)]
*  I think the symbolism, I mean, I should qualify. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2492.2400000000002s)]
*  My mother was born in Berlin. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2499.0s)]
*  My parents are Europeans. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2500.56s)]
*  And my parents became refugees from fascism in Europe. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2503.0s)]
*  And that's how I got born in Ohio. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2508.0s)]
*  So I'm a product of what I'm about to talk about, so it's close to me. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2510.84s)]
*  The symbolism of Mr. Trump, having behind him a row of billionaire oligarchs, you know, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  Zuckerberg and Bezos and Musk and all the others. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2527.88s)]
*  My first reaction, Chris, this is so stupid. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2534.36s)]
*  Why do I think that? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2538.92s)]
*  Because it is the fascist story laid out in a symbolism you couldn't possibly miss, if [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2540.84s)]
*  you know anything about that history. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2549.28s)]
*  Not the Supreme Court, not big politicians, not Nobel Prize winners or whatever he might [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2552.48s)]
*  have assembled behind him. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2559.52s)]
*  He chose the biggest, richest corporate oligarchs he could find and dress them up and put them [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2561.2s)]
*  there, each with their appropriate partner. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2570.24s)]
*  Staggering, I mean, just staggering. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2573.3599999999997s)]
*  Now economics. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2577.4399999999996s)]
*  Everything I see is an act of desperation. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2580.56s)]
*  It has nothing to do with any coherent plan. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2583.68s)]
*  That means, I want to be careful, I'm a mathematician, this is the equivalent, I won't use a math [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2588.28s)]
*  metaphor, I'll use a football metaphor. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2594.52s)]
*  Mr. Trump is heaving the so-called Hail Mary pass down the field. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2597.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2603.96s)]
*  For everybody who might not know, it's when you're so desperate, you're about to lose [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2604.96s)]
*  the game, you tell all your players to run down the field, maybe towards the left or [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2609.48s)]
*  the right, then you heave the ball over there and you hope that as it bounces around, the [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2615.2s)]
*  different hands reaching up to get it, it will actually come down by accident in one [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2622.64s)]
*  of your team members rather than the other one. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2628.2799999999997s)]
*  You miraculous. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2631.56s)]
*  Could Mr. Trump's assemblage of nonsense get you an outcome he would be happy with? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2633.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2640.7599999999998s)]
*  It has exactly the same chance as the Hail Mary pass, because everything he's doing [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2642.04s)]
*  is chaotic. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2649.32s)]
*  It's so difficult to talk about this sensibly, given the senselessness. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2652.6s)]
*  Most of the regulations we have in the federal government come as a result of years of struggle [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2658.44s)]
*  by impacted people who could not rely on the private sector, demanded action which could [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2666.44s)]
*  only be done by the government. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2674.52s)]
*  After Upton Sinclair teaches us about the meat business and people die left and right [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2677.0s)]
*  from food poisoning from the meat, we have a Food and Drug Administration because of [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2684.28s)]
*  course we have to make sure that the profit motive, which has nice outcomes sometimes, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2690.48s)]
*  has awful outcomes just as often, and if we don't police that, we're going to get the [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2696.88s)]
*  awful right alongside the good, and that's unbearable. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2702.12s)]
*  So every one of these things has that history behind it more or less. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2706.52s)]
*  The business community blocks it, delays it, postpones it, and then having lost that battle, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2711.36s)]
*  takes credit for it when it's done. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2718.84s)]
*  It's like my friend Deirdre McCloskey, an economist you probably know. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2721.28s)]
*  She loves to go around and say, isn't capitalism wonderful because we have a higher standard [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2727.04s)]
*  of living now than people did 200 years ago. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2732.2000000000003s)]
*  I love this. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2736.92s)]
*  Every one of the things she points at was opposed, delayed, blocked by the capitalists. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2738.56s)]
*  They fought it tooth and nail, and then they have the clever PR once they've been defeated, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2745.04s)]
*  and we have it, to take credit for it. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2751.6s)]
*  And now the final indignity, having taken credit for it for 20 years, they're going [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2755.2s)]
*  to smash it in the name of efficiency. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2761.36s)]
*  The irony here, you have to take a breath. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2766.32s)]
*  This is what you get in the last gasp of an economy. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2771.98s)]
*  You get crazy stuff. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2777.22s)]
*  So now we're going to deregulate. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2778.98s)]
*  We will have one scandal after another. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2781.2400000000002s)]
*  Look at the scandal. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2784.18s)]
*  Today's paper was full of people being deported from the United States who have no reason [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2785.18s)]
*  to be deported. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2791.34s)]
*  And the government has to say, well, that was a glitch, or this was a mistake, or that [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2792.34s)]
*  one attended a funeral of a leader. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2796.78s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2799.18s)]
*  That's not what this is about. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2800.9s)]
*  Is it really? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2802.46s)]
*  That's what you're doing? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2804.28s)]
*  And so people will now have a story to tell. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2806.6s)]
*  How incompetent, how inappropriate, how dangerous these deregulation. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2809.64s)]
*  So my guess, we're creating the opportunity for someone on the left side, using the word [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2817.5s)]
*  very broadly, to come in, hopefully not a demagogue, to ride across all of the messups [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2829.18s)]
*  that are coming down the pike and put the finger on Mr. Trump and MAGA and push them [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2837.5s)]
*  back into the margins from whence they came. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2843.62s)]
*  Look, Mr. Trump rode the dissatisfaction of a declining empire, a population that could [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2846.8999999999996s)]
*  face that its empire was over, and so were willing to blame Biden, for God's sake. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2854.74s)]
*  What a joke. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2861.66s)]
*  But he was able to ride that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2863.66s)]
*  And the people who come after him, they will ride the same process and blame him with the [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2866.0s)]
*  same minimum justification. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2871.7799999999997s)]
*  He's not the author of this. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2874.7s)]
*  He is right, as he himself said, to be right. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2876.8599999999997s)]
*  His opening remark, I could go, I remember from years ago, I could go out on Fifth Avenue, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2880.74s)]
*  he said, and shoot someone and nothing would happen to me because somehow, right now, what [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2886.5s)]
*  comes out of my mouth isn't the nonsense it always was thought to be. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2893.02s)]
*  It is incredible wisdom. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2898.4599999999996s)]
*  Great. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aFnl-x_3M&t=2902.4599999999996s)]
