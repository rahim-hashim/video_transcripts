# War on Gaza (w/ Joe Sacco) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU)
*  I first met the cartoonist Joe Sacco in Bosnia shortly after the war in 1995 where I was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=0.0s)]
*  reporting for the New York Times. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=16.0s)]
*  I knew nothing about comics and was unfamiliar with his work, but I knew something about [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  reporting. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  And as we worked together in the Bosnian town of Garajda, where Joe was gathering material [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  for what would become his book, Safe Area Garajda, I very swiftly realized that Joe [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=29.16s)]
*  was a brilliant and meticulous reporter. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=34.52s)]
*  We later did a book together, Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt, where 50 pages were given [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=37.9s)]
*  over to his comics. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=42.8s)]
*  Invariably, once what I thought was an exhaustive interview, often lasting a few hours, was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=45.0s)]
*  done, Joe would quietly ask the half dozen or so questions I had missed, questions that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=50.96s)]
*  were vital to the narrative. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=56.92s)]
*  Joe invented non-fiction graphic journalism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=58.8s)]
*  He not only reports his stories, he draws them out in cartoons, a labor-intensive process [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  that can take years. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=67.14s)]
*  This marriage of graphic, illustration, and panels give a visceral power to his reporting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=68.97999999999999s)]
*  that we as writers often struggle to match. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=74.56s)]
*  From 1993 to 1995, he published nine comics on the plight of the Palestinians living under [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  Israeli occupation, later collected in the book Palestine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=83.44s)]
*  His book educated a generation about the brutality of Israel's settler colonial project [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=87.48s)]
*  and system of apartheid. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  It won an American Book Award and is often included in college syllabuses. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=95.44s)]
*  Edward Said, in the introduction to Palestine, wrote, with the exception of one or two novelists [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  and poets, no one has ever rendered this terrible state of affairs better than Joe Sacco. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=105.56s)]
*  I worked again with Joe on an article for Harper's Magazine called A Gaza Diary, which [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=112.16s)]
*  chronicled the life of Palestinians in the Hanayunis refugee camp in Gaza in 2001. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=116.96s)]
*  During our reporting, we interviewed survivors of the massacres carried out when Israel occupied [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=123.44s)]
*  the Gaza Strip in 1956, massacres in which at least 275 men and boys were executed by [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=127.88s)]
*  Israeli soldiers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=135.24s)]
*  The editors at Harper's edited out this part of the story, arguing that it was irrelevant [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=136.74s)]
*  because it was history. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=141.24s)]
*  This did not sit well with me, it certainly did not sit well with Joe, who spent the next [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=142.76s)]
*  six years making repeated trips to Gaza to doggedly track down victims and eyewitnesses [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  of the massacre. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=152.88s)]
*  The result was his masterpiece, Footnotes in Gaza, one of the finest books on the Palestine-Israel [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=154.16s)]
*  conflict. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  Joe is well aware that context is key, that those who do not understand the past do not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  understand the present. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  And now he and I, who have spent considerable time in Gaza, watch the live stream Genocide, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=168.0s)]
*  one where familiar places in Gaza are reduced to rubble. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=174.4s)]
*  Palestinians we know and care about are killed, disappear or disappear, no doubt buried under [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=178.44s)]
*  the rubble or are forced into exile. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=183.52s)]
*  We each have devoted considerable time and energy since the genocide began, desperately [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=185.96s)]
*  trying to make the voices and the suffering of the Palestinians heard. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=190.96s)]
*  The result for Joe is this new comic on Gaza, which we will be discussing today. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=195.6s)]
*  Let's begin with your reaction after October 7th. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=201.32s)]
*  I'm sure it was very similar to mine, this desperate urge to chronicle, express, in your [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=205.7s)]
*  case of course, also draw about what was happening. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=213.4s)]
*  But talk about that moment and the impetus for what became this book on Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=217.84s)]
*  Well, my first reaction on October 7th was great shock. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, first of all, I just heard about a lot of Israeli civilians being killed, heard [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=229.92s)]
*  about the festival and the killings that took place there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=234.16s)]
*  And I was overwhelmed by the numbers and the sense of what must have happened. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  And to be honest, that sort of paralyzed me for a minute or two. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  But then the bombing that started almost immediately basically incapacitated me, at [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=252.12s)]
*  least for some weeks. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=263.96s)]
*  I mean, I felt I had to do something. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=267.16s)]
*  I knew I was going to do something. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=269.36s)]
*  But for that first period, just as a human being, I couldn't really take it all in myself. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=272.2s)]
*  I had some news organizations calling me up for a reaction. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  And I didn't even answer the phone because I had no reaction. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I had nothing to say, nothing geopolitical to say, no great analysis. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=287.92s)]
*  Just as a human being, I was just taken aback. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  I tried to do some work. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=302.0s)]
*  I picked up my pen, took some notes. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=304.12s)]
*  It was sort of going nowhere. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=307.88s)]
*  But then a friend wrote to me from Han Yunus and said, please raise up your voice. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=309.98s)]
*  And then that was the moment I just decided, OK, just start. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=317.22s)]
*  Whatever it is, just begin and let's see what comes out of it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=321.74s)]
*  And once I really began, it all just began to flow out of me. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=327.82s)]
*  I mean, sometimes that's what it takes. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=331.54s)]
*  It's not a question of thinking about it or mulling it over. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  It's a question of actually just doing. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=336.58s)]
*  And you think by doing somehow. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=338.74s)]
*  And like you, I can't go there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  I can't report from there, which is what I'd rather do. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=345.97999999999996s)]
*  I'd rather talk to people, get their reactions, see what they have to say, see with my own [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=348.9s)]
*  eyes what's going on. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=355.02s)]
*  But because I couldn't do that, I had to approach it in some other way. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=356.82s)]
*  And I didn't want it to be an outright polemic, which is kind of how I felt. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=360.5s)]
*  I should write a polemic. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=365.42s)]
*  But I wanted to bring the reader along with me. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=367.98s)]
*  And so I fell back on something I'd been doing for a long time, which is satire. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=371.14s)]
*  That's a place where I'm comfortable, is working with satire. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=375.78s)]
*  And then I basically found my voice as I was going along with the drawings, which first [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=380.1s)]
*  appeared in the comics journal. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  Whenever I finished one or two, I would send them in and they would post them as I [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=390.58s)]
*  finished them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=395.14s)]
*  I remember you telling me that you worked with this was with Fanta graphics, which [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=396.94s)]
*  publishes your book. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=401.62s)]
*  Well, it has published, I think, all your books, right? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=403.02s)]
*  That's not all, but most of the half, I'd say half. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  OK. And I remember you saying that you just assumed that although you had been [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=409.62s)]
*  approached by mainstream publications like The Guardian, you just assume they [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=415.97999999999996s)]
*  wouldn't run your stuff. Is that correct? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=420.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, it was I was assuming that I would start in my own head, starting to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=422.1s)]
*  accommodate myself to a to a way of doing things. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=427.5s)]
*  You know, you do you sort of think about what the what the Guardian would need to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=432.1s)]
*  sort of balance this or that out. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  And I thought I didn't want to play that game with myself. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=439.06s)]
*  I mean, I'm glad they approached me. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=441.98s)]
*  It was nice, but I knew that Fanta graphics and the publisher publishers there, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=443.5s)]
*  Gary Groth and Eric Reynolds, where they got what was going on and they felt very [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=448.46s)]
*  strongly about what was going on. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=453.9s)]
*  And I knew they weren't going to mess with any of my words and I wouldn't have to [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=455.46s)]
*  second think anything. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=457.97999999999996s)]
*  So let's begin as the book begins. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=462.18s)]
*  And that is about your you talk about that paralysis, your initial response, and [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=466.62s)]
*  you reflect you read a long time ago when I was in Gaza, I told my friend what the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=476.26000000000005s)]
*  Palestinians there ought to do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=483.78000000000003s)]
*  They ought to take a page from Gandhi's book. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=486.26000000000005s)]
*  And that's what they did with The Great March of Return. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=490.1s)]
*  Talk talk about that and what you ended up drawing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I was, you know, I believe nonviolence is the best way to go, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=496.66s)]
*  ultimately, when I suggested it to my Palestinian friend, he said, if we march to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=502.46s)]
*  the wall in a great demonstration to protest the blockade or to protest our lives here [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=510.94s)]
*  in the occupation, they'll shoot us. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=517.18s)]
*  They're going to shoot us. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=519.46s)]
*  And when they did have The Great March of Return some years later, they marched to the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=521.26s)]
*  fortified fence and and were shot down in droves. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=528.14s)]
*  A couple of hundred were killed. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=532.3s)]
*  This was almost exclusively a peaceful demonstration. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=533.6999999999999s)]
*  And Amnesty reported that it seemed that Israeli snipers were shooting at people to wound [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=537.62s)]
*  them in ways that would require, you know, amputations, basically. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=543.6999999999999s)]
*  So at that point, I realized, who am I to suggest how the Palestinian Palestinians should [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=549.86s)]
*  respond to the occupation? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=556.34s)]
*  I'm not living under the occupation. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=557.58s)]
*  I wouldn't know how I would react to myself under, you know, if I were in their shoes. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=559.98s)]
*  You have a full page and you ask as a question, is it genocide or is it self-defense? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=567.9000000000001s)]
*  Let's make everyone happy and say it is both. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=576.22s)]
*  In that case, we'll need new terminology. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=578.86s)]
*  I propose genocidal self-defense that should give both sides something to work with. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=582.3s)]
*  Of course, this was early on when the use of the term genocide didn't have as much currency [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=589.5s)]
*  in the mainstream as it does now. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=596.26s)]
*  That might be the case, but it seems clear to me almost immediately that's what was [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=599.02s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=603.18s)]
*  I mean, hundreds of Palestinians were getting killed every day in this first few weeks, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  virtually. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=611.34s)]
*  And Netanyahu, I think a couple of days into all this, was talking about Amalek. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=612.7s)]
*  He was talking about, he was making biblical references to a people that were exterminated [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=619.7800000000001s)]
*  and that God had required the extermination of those people down to the sucklings, in [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=624.94s)]
*  other words, the babies at the breast, and the animals. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=631.5s)]
*  And there was a lot of indications from other Israeli politicians that, you know, Gallant [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=635.14s)]
*  calling the Palestinians human animals. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=640.78s)]
*  If you couple what looked to me like intent with great devastation, it was early on, it [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=644.74s)]
*  seemed like it was going to be genocidal. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=653.5799999999999s)]
*  Now self-defense, I mean, that's sort of the mantra. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=656.5799999999999s)]
*  Israel has the right to defend itself. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=660.1s)]
*  It almost has like a biblical feel to it at this point. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=661.9s)]
*  But then we have to examine what is self-defense? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=665.14s)]
*  I mean, we throw that around. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=667.06s)]
*  Does self-defense include everything, every atrocity up to and including genocide? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=669.18s)]
*  We have to question terminologies like self-defense when it gets to that point. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  I have to ask you about that, because you talk about satire, but this is, you know, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=679.3399999999999s)]
*  there's a very dark humor. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=684.54s)]
*  When we first met, I think one of the books that we discussed together in Bosnia was Selin, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=687.3s)]
*  Louis Fernand Selin's Journey to the End of the Night, Death on the Installment Plan. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=694.6999999999999s)]
*  But it certainly has echoes of Selin. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=698.66s)]
*  It's not simply satire. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=700.74s)]
*  There's a darkness to what you're doing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=704.9399999999999s)]
*  There's a darkness, but it's sort of the darkness. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=706.6999999999999s)]
*  You find humor. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=709.3s)]
*  You will find humor in places like Gaza, places like Bosnia, and it's always of the darkest [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=710.8199999999999s)]
*  sort. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=715.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's their way of sort of managing their own thoughts, being funny, but understanding [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=716.5799999999999s)]
*  the underlying darkness of their humor. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=721.62s)]
*  I think I picked that up and I'm reflecting it back. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=726.06s)]
*  Yeah, completely. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=729.5799999999999s)]
*  So you talk about as an overnighted plane load after plane load of 2,000-pound bombs [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=733.14s)]
*  and 155-millimeter artillery rounds to Israel, the White House declared that there would [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=743.14s)]
*  be no red lines for its enraged ally. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=747.94s)]
*  And so, yeah, let's talk about that whole concept of red lines. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=755.34s)]
*  Well this is, I mean, the fact that they would say something like that is basically saying [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=762.98s)]
*  anything you do is okay with us. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=769.1s)]
*  And any red line that was stated, let's say Biden had his red line in Rafa, that was going [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=772.7s)]
*  to be a red line. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=780.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, even when they had red lines, it meant nothing. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=782.22s)]
*  Basically it was carte blanche, carte blanche to do whatever they want. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=787.58s)]
*  And that's what's been going on. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=791.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, bombs are being shoveled. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=792.98s)]
*  They're going there by the plane load and they're being used. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=797.0200000000001s)]
*  So there are no red lines for Israel, it seems, as far as America is concerned. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=801.34s)]
*  There were rhetorical red lines. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=807.4200000000001s)]
*  Rhetorical red lines, even though, again, Biden about Rafa, Israelis crossed that red [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=809.1s)]
*  line, they've obliterated Rafa. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=814.7s)]
*  And so let's talk about the aid, which you write about, this kind of assumption that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=818.82s)]
*  the United States is the chief humanitarian benefactor as well, of course, as the arms [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=831.62s)]
*  supplier. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=836.38s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know what to say when Jack Kirby said that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=837.38s)]
*  What do you say to something like that? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=844.1400000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable that a spokesperson, an official of the White House is saying something [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=846.06s)]
*  like we are the chief benefactor. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=852.5s)]
*  You can't find a greater humanitarian in this particular conflict than us, the people who [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=855.4599999999999s)]
*  are also providing the bombs. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=861.78s)]
*  I mean, this is beyond, I mean, this is not about satire anymore. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=864.66s)]
*  It's this, and you know, the journals are just noting it down, and it's just being pumped [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=870.7s)]
*  out to us. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=877.94s)]
*  And of course, I think at this point, everyone sees it for what it is, or everyone should [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=879.0600000000001s)]
*  see it for what it is. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=883.94s)]
*  Well, you call it America has just invented a kindler gentler genocide. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=885.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=890.5s)]
*  Because you want it both ways. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=891.5s)]
*  You want to be the, you know, you want to bomb them and you want to feed them. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=893.22s)]
*  But the feeding part, the so-called, the humanitarian gestures are the way of selling the genocide. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=896.98s)]
*  It's part of the sales, genocidal salesmanship. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=902.98s)]
*  As you say, it's something else. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=907.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was true with AID and every war that I covered. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  Okay, there you go. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=913.86s)]
*  It was a mechanism of, and of course it was, it was used to mask. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the war in El Salvador would be a perfect example. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=920.82s)]
*  It's about a narrative and how you shape a narrative while you're, you know, committing [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=924.78s)]
*  atrocities. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=930.3399999999999s)]
*  So you turn the page and you have a full page of Biden with the new scarlet letter, which [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=932.1s)]
*  is, it's a black and white drawing, but on Biden's forehead is G for genocide in red. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=938.74s)]
*  I just want to ask you, you know, because you do that all the time and all of your work, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=948.5s)]
*  your panels are not uniform. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=954.86s)]
*  They will, in Footnotes in Gaza, which we have to mention, which is a masterpiece. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=956.4200000000001s)]
*  It's one of the finest books done on the Palestine-Israel conflict, hands down. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=960.82s)]
*  You use the size in order to convey emotion, convey feelings of entrapment, feeling, but [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=968.2s)]
*  let's just talk about that reason that you flip the page because before you have, you [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=975.94s)]
*  know, more traditional panels and then it's a full page of Biden with the words, the new [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=981.9000000000001s)]
*  scarlet letter. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=986.6600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=987.98s)]
*  I wanted that to be, I mean, you know, I almost wanted that to be a meme, basically. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=988.98s)]
*  I mean, it already is. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=995.1s)]
*  We already have the term genocide Joe, but, you know, my hope is that this will be his [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=996.98s)]
*  historical legacy. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1002.84s)]
*  It should be his historical legacy. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1004.06s)]
*  And of course, I'm taking it from Hawthorne's book, The Scarlet Letter, where an adulteress [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1006.6999999999999s)]
*  had to wear, you know, the scarlet letter A. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1011.38s)]
*  So hopefully people got the reference. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1014.5s)]
*  But I think of Biden as a war criminal. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1019.22s)]
*  I mean, I'm not sure I understand why. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1026.3s)]
*  If we, if your listeners think that there's a genocide being committed and that we're [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1028.5s)]
*  culpable, then he should be considered a war criminal, as many other members of his administration. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1033.42s)]
*  And this is just, you know, giving it some, I'm just trying to give it some impact, this [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1041.06s)]
*  whole thought. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1045.34s)]
*  You have an image on the next page. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1049.86s)]
*  Biden repeating this false claim by Israel about beheaded babies, where he said he saw [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1055.0600000000002s)]
*  pictures of beheaded babies, which of course was a lie. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1065.42s)]
*  And right below that image, surely it was the divine that implanted images of beheaded [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1073.0200000000002s)]
*  babies and children into the mind of the president, for in fact, there were neither beheaded babies [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1078.5400000000002s)]
*  nor beheaded children and no images there of. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1084.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about that, because it's something that you and I have run into [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1089.4599999999998s)]
*  repeatedly that Israeli, that Hasbra, that Israeli propaganda machine and how it works. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1092.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1099.4199999999998s)]
*  There's an Israeli propaganda machine, and then there's the President of the United States [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1100.4199999999998s)]
*  embracing that and repeating the propaganda and pushing the propaganda. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1104.9399999999998s)]
*  Even when the White House talked it back, he continued to say the same thing in subsequent, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1110.62s)]
*  you know, subsequent speeches. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1118.9399999999998s)]
*  So to me, he's embracing the dehumanization of Palestinians. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1121.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, Hamas committed atrocities. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1126.1s)]
*  It seems that that seems like a reasonable charge. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1128.78s)]
*  But to make up atrocities, to conjure up what we would consider the lowest thing a human [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1133.98s)]
*  can do, beheading a baby. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1141.06s)]
*  I mean, that is a pro, that he is part of the dehumanization project. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1144.3s)]
*  And I mean, dehumanization is the sort of stepping stone to annihilation. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1148.34s)]
*  So that's what I'm trying to get across there. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1155.66s)]
*  You have that you had closed with that last image. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1159.38s)]
*  Oh, Israel, let a monument be raised atop the flattened cities of Amalek so that future [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1162.98s)]
*  generations will never forget the miracle of Joe Biden's hallucination. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1168.6200000000001s)]
*  I humbly submit this design to the relevant committee. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1173.18s)]
*  And it's a picture of a child and diapers beheaded with blood gushing out of the top of their head. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1176.5s)]
*  To me, that's part of his legacy, too, is paving the way for genocide with those statements [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1185.26s)]
*  like that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1191.02s)]
*  I mean, we have to look at the fact that the United States has sent bombs. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1192.02s)]
*  But then there's the rhetorical aspect, too, where they're not just emphasizing a narrative, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1195.42s)]
*  but creating one out of whole cloth. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1203.42s)]
*  The next little section is on your mother. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1208.26s)]
*  Your mother was a young woman in Malta in World War II. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1211.78s)]
*  I think Malta was one of the most heavily bombed places on Earth. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1215.94s)]
*  It was because it was a major kind of staging area in the Mediterranean for the British [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1223.5s)]
*  in particular. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1230.54s)]
*  But let's talk exactly about that narrative. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1233.1399999999999s)]
*  And you have also done a longer comic. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1238.78s)]
*  I can't remember what book it's in on your mother's experience in Malta. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1241.98s)]
*  Which book is that? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1246.34s)]
*  Where is that? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1247.34s)]
*  That's from Notes from a Defeatist. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1248.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1250.3799999999999s)]
*  But let's talk about that story that you tell about your mother. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1251.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1255.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, my mother's 95. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1256.3799999999999s)]
*  And when my sister and I talk in front of her, we've tried to avoid talking about Gaza. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1259.82s)]
*  We started talking about it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1265.82s)]
*  And she overheard. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1267.02s)]
*  And then she started immediately thinking about her own experiences in World War II. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1268.68s)]
*  And for about two and a half years, Malta was very heavily bombed, as you mentioned. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1273.82s)]
*  And she lived in a quarry. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1279.1s)]
*  She lived in a shelter. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1281.58s)]
*  She saw friends killed. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1284.1399999999999s)]
*  She was personally strafed by a German fighter plane. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1286.6s)]
*  She used to tell us about not having any food. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1292.12s)]
*  Like basically going to school with one small piece of bread. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1294.42s)]
*  And that's what she ate for the day. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1300.46s)]
*  And eating it right away so no one would take it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1302.98s)]
*  I mean, she lived under very bad conditions in the war. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1305.14s)]
*  And so did my dad. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1309.02s)]
*  So I grew up with those stories. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1310.02s)]
*  And it's clear. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1312.9s)]
*  You know, she doesn't remember a lot of things now. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1316.46s)]
*  But these are the memories that come back to her. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1318.18s)]
*  These are the ones that are dredged up in her mind. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1320.04s)]
*  And it's clear that the trauma is still, it's still, when she'll forget what she did, you [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1323.46s)]
*  know, ten minutes ago, the trauma of what happened in World War II is still with her. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1329.16s)]
*  She started talking about what was going on when we were talking about Gaza. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1334.44s)]
*  She was talking about her own experiences. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1338.06s)]
*  And then of course, I, at the end of that particular story, I talk about the Israeli [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1340.9s)]
*  Minister, Meg Golan, I think, who hoped that Palestinian babies now, 80 years from now, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1346.24s)]
*  would be telling their grandchildren, this is what we did. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1355.8s)]
*  This is what the Israelis had done to the Palestinians, as if to sort of revel in the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1359.08s)]
*  idea that trauma would be handed down from one generation to another. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1365.56s)]
*  And it will be. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1369.68s)]
*  And I mean, to find pleasure in that is so disgusting that you're, I mean, you've reached [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1371.68s)]
*  a level of being able to dehumanize people to that extent that you hope their grandchildren's [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1379.12s)]
*  grandchildren perhaps will still suffer the trauma from it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1384.4s)]
*  Well, and this is what you did so powerfully in footnotes in Gaza. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1389.2s)]
*  Well, again, I mean, I talked to people who in the middle of the 1950s were attacked by [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1397.8400000000001s)]
*  the Israelis and a lot of the men were lined up against walls and shot. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1405.2s)]
*  And people who survived that, when I was talking to them, yeah, half a century later, you could [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1410.6000000000001s)]
*  tell the trauma was still there. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1418.16s)]
*  They remembered very well being beaten over the head as they entered into a school to [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1420.3200000000002s)]
*  get screened, for example. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1425.04s)]
*  So trauma does, it is passed down the generations. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1427.92s)]
*  And you know, obviously, the Jewish people understand this. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1433.2s)]
*  People who are traumatized, it will just continue with their children and others. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1440.48s)]
*  I mean, you know, I have friends whose parents went through the Holocaust. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1447.92s)]
*  And my friends are traumatized by that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1453.88s)]
*  Let's talk about the next. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1460.5200000000002s)]
*  So a reading from the book of genocide. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1461.96s)]
*  Of course, what you're pulling on is Sodom and Gomorrah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1465.3200000000002s)]
*  I love the biblical references. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1467.72s)]
*  But it's Netanyahu, who in this comic is Yahweh up in the clouds, and Biden looking out and [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1471.2s)]
*  saying, will thou also destroy the righteous and the wicked? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1483.64s)]
*  Suppose there are 50 righteous men in Gaza. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1488.4s)]
*  Wilt thou then sweep them away and not pardon the place for the sake of the 50? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1491.68s)]
*  This is, of course, right out of that biblical story. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1496.24s)]
*  But talk about that little story. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1498.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's Abraham was asking Yahweh. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1500.16s)]
*  Could you say, would you save the city? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1507.3200000000002s)]
*  Basically, if it came down to just a few individuals were righteous. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1508.88s)]
*  And I sort of reverse it. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1513.12s)]
*  And we start with if there were just a few righteous in Gaza, and I increase the number. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1515.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't decrease it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1521.4799999999998s)]
*  So at the end, it's if there are two million innocent people in Gaza, would you still destroy [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1522.52s)]
*  it? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1528.8s)]
*  And half of them are children and half of them are children. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1530.1599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1532.6799999999998s)]
*  And I mean, obviously, we know the answer to that because we've seen Netanyahu's actions. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1533.6799999999998s)]
*  But then I'm also showing that Biden wasn't being sincere with this question. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1538.34s)]
*  It was just a joke to him anyway. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1543.1799999999998s)]
*  He's going to provide the bombs to destroy these the innocent as well as the guilty. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1544.6599999999999s)]
*  The end of that panel is I think it gets back to the point you made earlier about Biden's [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1560.06s)]
*  legacy and the genocide. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1566.66s)]
*  So you said the and the president looked back and he was turned into a pillar of votes for [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1571.76s)]
*  Jill Stein. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1578.98s)]
*  That's, of course, the pillar of salt. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1579.98s)]
*  But just mentioned that a complete moral bankruptcy on the part not just of Biden, but the entire [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1582.8600000000001s)]
*  ruling class, Republican or Democrat. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1593.7s)]
*  Well, that's the whole idea. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1596.74s)]
*  I mean, the biblical story fit quite well, because lot when he escapes, Gomorrah is told [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1598.06s)]
*  not he's told not to look back and his wife looks back and turned into a pillar of salt. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1605.02s)]
*  But that's the whole idea. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1610.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like this is being committed. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1611.8600000000001s)]
*  But it's almost a way of saying I mean, in this particular case, it's Biden, Blinken. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1613.6200000000001s)]
*  We're not responsible. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1619.54s)]
*  We're moving on from this. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1620.7s)]
*  Ignore what we've done. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1622.94s)]
*  Don't think about it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1625.3799999999999s)]
*  Don't talk about it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1626.3799999999999s)]
*  But in this particular case, when Biden was still running for was running for election, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1627.3799999999999s)]
*  I felt like he this would he would suffer from this electorally on some some level. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1633.94s)]
*  And he did. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1642.34s)]
*  Or Democrats did. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1643.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1645.34s)]
*  And they deserve to. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1646.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1647.34s)]
*  So then we're back in Portland. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1648.7s)]
*  And you're just talking about which I think all of us who've worked in Gaza feel the sense [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1654.38s)]
*  of powerlessness, the sense of frustration, outrage at just this live stream genocide. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1661.66s)]
*  But you immediately, of course, tie it into the unhoused population in the city. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1672.46s)]
*  So just talk about that, that narrative and what you're what you're seeking to express [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1677.7s)]
*  in terms of your own feelings. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1684.14s)]
*  Well, my own feelings are, you know, I live in the United States. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1685.5800000000002s)]
*  I pay taxes here. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1689.66s)]
*  I live in Portland, Oregon. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1691.66s)]
*  There are a lot of homeless people on the street. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1692.66s)]
*  There are a lot of people who need help. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1695.42s)]
*  There are a lot of structural problems with the United States that are causing what I'm [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1698.06s)]
*  seeing on the streets. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1702.54s)]
*  I would hope that, I mean, in a better world, that's where my tax money would be going, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1704.5s)]
*  is to helping people who need it that live in America. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1710.54s)]
*  Instead, it's going to killing people in Gaza. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1716.06s)]
*  Well, that's what it seems to me. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1720.3400000000001s)]
*  And I've always had this idea that whatever I'm paying in taxes really just adds up to [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1722.18s)]
*  one small piece of shrapnel. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1727.14s)]
*  I mean, as a nightmare, I just imagine that all my money is funneled into a small part [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1729.9s)]
*  of a bomb that causes someone to lose their life in Gaza. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1739.5s)]
*  Well, but of course, that's true. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1743.9s)]
*  That is true. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1747.46s)]
*  I'm paying for it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1748.46s)]
*  I mean, I'm culpable. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1749.46s)]
*  I don't want to be culpable. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1751.3000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to be part of this genocide, but I am part of a genocide. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1752.7s)]
*  As you are, Chris, whether you like it or not, and as the readers are, or as your listeners [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1756.94s)]
*  are, so I feel a sense of responsibility for what's going on. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1761.94s)]
*  Your next section is about the forthcoming election and a president who will facilitate [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1769.94s)]
*  a genocide and a former president who will end our democracy. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1777.5800000000002s)]
*  And I have to, as a caveat, say that I totally stole that line because you mentioned it to [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1781.8600000000001s)]
*  me when we met in New York. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1786.46s)]
*  And because you're honest and decent, you called up before you wrote this and said, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1788.3000000000002s)]
*  you just want to know that you'd thought of it first. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1793.5800000000002s)]
*  And I said, of course you thought of it first. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1795.94s)]
*  I used it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1797.42s)]
*  You used it first. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1798.42s)]
*  I just used it first. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1801.26s)]
*  But this is the frustration I think I felt in this election. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1804.3400000000001s)]
*  How can we vote? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1810.72s)]
*  How can we normalize genocide as a governmental policy? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1812.3600000000001s)]
*  How can we vote for anyone who embraces a genocide? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1815.42s)]
*  And yet none of us want Trump. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1821.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Trump's, Biden's, or the Democratic Party's disdain for democracy is perhaps subtler, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1823.7s)]
*  but is there. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1830.6200000000001s)]
*  But Trump's disdain for democracy is quite overt and open. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1831.6200000000001s)]
*  So let's just talk about the last election in light of the genocide and what you drew. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1837.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think you just have to, you have to question where we are today, that [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1844.6000000000001s)]
*  these are the people our political parties are going to throw up or these are what our [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1853.14s)]
*  political parties actually represent. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1858.5s)]
*  One does, the Republicans do seem to represent some movement toward or move toward a completely [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1861.52s)]
*  anti-democratic system. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1869.54s)]
*  And then the Democratic Party, you know, if you voted for them, you were going to, you [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1871.78s)]
*  were basically going to give a rubber stamp to what had been going on with the genocide. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1877.3s)]
*  There was never an idea, there was never the sense that, oh, this is going to stop if Kamala [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1883.06s)]
*  Harris is elected. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1886.78s)]
*  She never said anything like that. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1888.5s)]
*  So I don't understand how you morally can vote for either. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1891.18s)]
*  I understand that people say, oh, Trump is worse. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1896.02s)]
*  And I had a lot of discussions with friends who were debating this whole issue. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1898.6200000000001s)]
*  But in the end, I'd say, well, you know, you're going to be voting for a genocide one way [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1903.7s)]
*  or the other. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1906.82s)]
*  So how can you actually be part of that? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1907.82s)]
*  How can you, how can you put your name behind any of that? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1909.78s)]
*  But if we're at that place, then we really have to question where we are as a republic. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1915.94s)]
*  Who are the people who are representing us? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1921.14s)]
*  Who are the parties that are representing us? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1924.64s)]
*  Yeah, well, that and also the fact that 66 percent of the public, it's either 61 or 66 [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1927.64s)]
*  percent of the public, opposes arm shipments to Israel and 77 percent of the registered [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1936.68s)]
*  Democrats oppose. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  And it's irrelevant. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1943.3200000000002s)]
*  It's irrelevant. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1944.8400000000001s)]
*  And they will still vote for the Democrats. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1945.8400000000001s)]
*  And let's talk about, because this is also a panel, on freedom of speech, because it's [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1951.44s)]
*  become even worse since you drew this on college campuses. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1958.64s)]
*  They've become academic gulags. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1962.48s)]
*  Everything is shut down. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1965.06s)]
*  Students who participated in the encampments or occupations are on probation or suspended. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1966.98s)]
*  Faculty members have been terminated, the few who have spoken up. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1974.98s)]
*  But you see all of this coming. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1980.44s)]
*  There's that panel with, of Biden speaking at AIPAC. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1984.3400000000001s)]
*  One thing this war taught us is that never again is a registered trademark licensed only [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1992.6000000000001s)]
*  under certain conditions that anyone trespassing on this intellectual property will be severely [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=1997.92s)]
*  reprimanded. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2003.0s)]
*  Indeed, we now live in a world where saying you want to stop a genocide is hate speech [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2005.44s)]
*  while slandering those who want to stop it is paid speech. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2010.8s)]
*  And at the end, that last panel and the answer to more speech is a police charge. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2016.6000000000001s)]
*  It's even worse than when you drew this. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2022.76s)]
*  Let's talk about that suppression of speech and its consequences. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2024.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't think that all of these new rules, which universities and colleges spent the summer oftentimes [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2032.04s)]
*  in not only collaborating, but working with security firms that have close ties to Israel, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2038.04s)]
*  I don't see how those rules will be lifted even after the genocide. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2044.76s)]
*  Well yeah, maybe some of these things are going to be here to stay. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2050.04s)]
*  What's really important? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2053.24s)]
*  I think what the students really, I was really, if you want to talk about hope, I found it [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2054.56s)]
*  in the students and what they were saying and how they were willing to put themselves [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2062.2000000000003s)]
*  on the line. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2067.92s)]
*  And of course, they were a threat because they were seeing a different narrative. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2068.92s)]
*  They were understanding things. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2077.7000000000003s)]
*  I think first, viscerally, just by looking on their phones and seeing what was going on, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2078.96s)]
*  I think they were viscerally disgusted and they must have thought this has to stop. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2084.48s)]
*  And then they began to educate themselves, I think, about what was going on. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2090.04s)]
*  And the narrative was shifting. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2095.2s)]
*  The narrative has shifted in many ways, so that narrative has to be suppressed. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2097.0s)]
*  But it shows how effective they've been that these draconian measures are now being implemented. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2102.92s)]
*  You know, this isn't my thought. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2109.68s)]
*  I heard it somewhere, but someone was saying that, you know, here are these students, they're [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2112.3199999999997s)]
*  learning about, they're in these classes learning about Frantz Fanon and reading Edward Said. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2117.08s)]
*  And then they take this on board. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2123.16s)]
*  And then when they want to sort of express it in praxis somehow, when they actually want [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2126.7599999999998s)]
*  to implement what they're being taught, they're crushed. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2133.16s)]
*  I mean, you really have to wonder about what the academic institutions are providing. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2138.04s)]
*  What service are they providing for so much money? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2142.36s)]
*  Yes, you can talk about this and talk about this, but at some point you can't talk about [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2144.68s)]
*  this because now this is a particular issue where any line, you know, you're going to [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2149.56s)]
*  be crossing a line. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2154.12s)]
*  And that's the whole idea. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2155.12s)]
*  You begin to talk about one narrative, let's say the students' narrative, as being hate [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2156.68s)]
*  speech. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2162.56s)]
*  No, you're anti-Semitic. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2163.56s)]
*  Even Jewish students are being anti-Semitic. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2166.22s)]
*  I mean, I think the liberal order is sort of twisting itself and knots here, but in [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2170.4599999999996s)]
*  the end they have force on their side. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2173.98s)]
*  They can call the police. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2177.3399999999997s)]
*  They do call the police. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2179.4599999999996s)]
*  You have this full page panel. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2185.58s)]
*  Gaza was where the West went to die. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2188.1s)]
*  The only truth still held to be self-evident was that the rules-based order weighed 2,000 [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2190.74s)]
*  pounds and could flatten an entire neighborhood. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2195.9599999999996s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2199.8799999999997s)]
*  I think that not that the rules-based order was honored in Iraq or Afghanistan, Syria, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2201.02s)]
*  Libya, go back to Vietnam, but now there's no pretense anymore of a rules-based order. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2207.8999999999996s)]
*  And what are the consequences of that? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2215.9799999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, what are the new rules if there's no rules-based order? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2219.86s)]
*  We don't know what those are. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2224.86s)]
*  You're right. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2226.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, the West, especially the United States, has always been hypocritical about rules and [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2227.5800000000004s)]
*  international norms. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2232.34s)]
*  Of course, they're setting the international norms and they're the ones who are deciding [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2234.6600000000003s)]
*  who's following them and who isn't. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2238.98s)]
*  There's no universal laws, really. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2245.78s)]
*  They're particular. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2249.14s)]
*  But what we've seen, really, like you say, is the hypocrisy now is on open display. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2251.06s)]
*  They're not trying to hide it anymore, that international law doesn't matter. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2259.54s)]
*  I mean, an international criminal court can hand down arrest warrants and it's just, you [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2264.02s)]
*  know, the West, the collective West is mostly going to shrug its shoulders at this. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2271.3399999999997s)]
*  The United States is going to ignore it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2276.22s)]
*  So what are the rules about? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2278.94s)]
*  I mean, we have to question all these things. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2280.7400000000002s)]
*  And this is that panel, human. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2285.98s)]
*  So you have these parachuted aid packages, which of course are, it's very cynical publicity, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2289.46s)]
*  provides nothing in terms of real food to Palestinians. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2303.98s)]
*  So you had this picture with these aid packages being dropped from a plane by parachute and [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2311.06s)]
*  next to a long trench filled with shrouded corpses. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2318.46s)]
*  And you write, human animals would have no right to water, much less to the rights of [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2324.1s)]
*  man and the only inalienable rights endowed with amalek would be death, servitude and [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2329.54s)]
*  the pursuit of air drops. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2336.7s)]
*  One might fairly ask, was the Enlightenment buried in the rubble of Gaza or was the rubble [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2338.66s)]
*  the Enlightenment's logical conclusion? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2343.74s)]
*  Well, was it the Enlightenment's logical conclusion? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2346.58s)]
*  That is a pretty weighty philosophical argument, which we're not going to spend the whole show [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2353.94s)]
*  on. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2358.14s)]
*  I can't talk about it a bit. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2359.74s)]
*  I mean, if you read those philosophers, I mean, and I think they had great contributions to [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2360.74s)]
*  make. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2365.8199999999997s)]
*  But actually, if you read them, you realize they were racist. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2367.46s)]
*  They were talking, you know, theory David Hume or a man, what Emanuel Kant, I mean, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2371.1s)]
*  they said things that are really would be would get them canceled today. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2375.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, the white race was the was the superior race. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2380.3399999999997s)]
*  Other races had nothing to offer at all. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2385.18s)]
*  Other races weren't intelligent at all. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2388.1s)]
*  So with the Enlightenment, the Enlightenment was always an exclusionary project. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2390.3399999999997s)]
*  That's why you could have America's founding fathers have this great document or documents [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2395.46s)]
*  with basically establishing the liberal order here and also have slavery and genocide at [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2403.66s)]
*  the same time. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2409.66s)]
*  I mean, it's the Enlightenment was always circling around itself on these particular [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2410.7s)]
*  issues. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2417.8599999999997s)]
*  And so there was there were good things about the Enlightenment and about the West, obviously. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2419.18s)]
*  But then, you know, let's let's let's see what's really let's see what's really happening. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2423.8599999999997s)]
*  Ultimately, there is a racist project in the West. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2429.7s)]
*  Well, that comment reminds me of the writings of philosopher John Gray, who argues that [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2434.06s)]
*  the Enlightenment believed in educating people to think correctly and behave correctly, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2440.58s)]
*  but that those who could not be educated or refuse to be educated. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2447.38s)]
*  And this gave birth to the Jacobins were then eradicated. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2451.98s)]
*  And he draws a direct line from the Enlightenment project to the Jacobins to finally the Stalinists. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2455.06s)]
*  And that that his writings are thought about his writings. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2463.62s)]
*  And you asked precisely that question, whether this was the natural denouement of the Enlightenment. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2468.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2474.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2475.54s)]
*  I think that, you know, you go back to the academic institutions. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2476.54s)]
*  I think the academic institutions, which have been corporatized, become just appendages [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2481.94s)]
*  of the corporate state, have been completely exposed, not just the ruling governing apparatus, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2488.2599999999998s)]
*  but also the academic institutions have been exposed for their own bankruptcy, not that [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2495.94s)]
*  they were ever great. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2502.82s)]
*  But there used to be more space on academic or university or colleges, college campuses. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2504.34s)]
*  And now even the heads of I mean, where was Shafik, the president of Colombia? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2511.3s)]
*  Where did you come from? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2516.5s)]
*  The World Bank? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2517.5s)]
*  I mean, the the and it's not just that sometimes they'll have a figurehead president who has [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2518.5s)]
*  a PhD in physics, but then all of the administrators are drawn out of the corporate world. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2523.7s)]
*  So and you've seen a withering away of the humanities and accentuation on stem. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2529.54s)]
*  And these gleaming business schools, business schools should not even be on college campuses. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2536.9s)]
*  But and the transformation of big research universities like Stanford, Harvard's underway, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2542.54s)]
*  into essentially becoming vocational schools, technical schools. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2548.54s)]
*  But you hit that you hit the universities. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2554.34s)]
*  And I just wondered if you could comment on that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2559.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, I agree with everything you've been saying there. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2562.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure how students I really wonder how students are faring now going back to [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2569.7400000000002s)]
*  classes where they're they're talking about things and they're talking about things only in the [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2574.62s)]
*  theoretical now, because if they if they shift to actually acting on some of this theory, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2579.5s)]
*  they know what's in store for them. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2585.66s)]
*  So I'm not sure if they really feel like they're like, what's the education they're getting? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2587.1s)]
*  This is all sort of in the cloud stuff that you've been taught about decolonization or, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2593.02s)]
*  you know, inclusivity or whatever it is. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2599.5s)]
*  I mean, it's all sort of it's sort of a camera that you're still going to be paying to be taught [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2602.06s)]
*  the theory. I don't know. That's up to them to figure that out. I hope they do. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2607.58s)]
*  And you write in so oppression abroad and repression at home orbit each other in an [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2615.18s)]
*  ever tightening circle and will achieve singularity when the last self hating Jewish student [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2619.74s)]
*  is strangled with the entrails of the last child in Gaza. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2625.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's you draw you draw that parallel, which I think is smart between what's happening [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2631.1s)]
*  on the outer reaches of empire and what's happening at home. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2636.54s)]
*  Yeah, because I think what happens what happens abroad, what we do abroad eventually will [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2639.74s)]
*  will come back to us. I mean, look at the militarization of American police forces since [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2644.78s)]
*  the Iraq war. I mean, I think you and I remember pretty ordinary patrol cars going by and police [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2650.54s)]
*  looking just as vulnerable as anyone else when they're on the street just in their blue uniforms. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2659.1800000000003s)]
*  It's not like that anymore. So, you know, we have to think about how we're we're poisoning [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2663.9s)]
*  ourselves with these wars abroad. It's not just causing damage abroad. It's we're poisoning [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2670.06s)]
*  ourselves on that next page. You write from universities to journalists and this picture of [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2675.42s)]
*  a murder of Palestinian journalists over 200, of course, have been murdered from ambulances [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2683.58s)]
*  to women's lingerie. After a while, one began to wonder what wasn't a military target in Gaza. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2689.18s)]
*  Let's talk about the behavior of the IDF in the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. And of [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2696.94s)]
*  course, all of this stuff is the the the looting itself was chronicled by Israeli soldiers [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2702.86s)]
*  themselves on social media. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2709.66s)]
*  Right. I mean, the IDF calls itself the world's most moral army. And I know institutions and [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2711.9s)]
*  nations have their their myths. And, you know, you have to hold people up to their myth. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2719.5s)]
*  So what is this morality that it claims to to have? The actions of the IDF have been atrocious. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2725.82s)]
*  Um, it seems like all of Gaza is what in Vietnam was called a free fire zone. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2737.98s)]
*  When when IDF sets up places that are safe havens or places where people can go where they're [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2745.8199999999997s)]
*  told they're going to be safe, they've they've moved from their bombed out home to another bombed [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2752.3799999999997s)]
*  out place to these safe places and that are also bombed. I'm not sure how we can use the term [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2755.8999999999996s)]
*  moral army when we're talking about the IDF. And I mean, but it also shows how how the Palestinians [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2764.7s)]
*  have been dehumanized over the decades in Israeli society that the average soldier will behave in [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2773.7400000000002s)]
*  this sort of way. I mean, they must I mean, they really have to have an image in their mind of what [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2780.3s)]
*  Palestinians are to to do this kind of thing and not flinch. I mean, they're they're filming [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2786.46s)]
*  themselves blowing up homes, blowing up universities. I'm not sure what else to say about it, Chris. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2793.34s)]
*  Well, that they've been indoctrinated. Elon pop actually wrote a book about it, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2803.5s)]
*  about the indoctrination machine starting in primary school. Well, there you go. I mean, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2807.58s)]
*  and they're always accusing the Palestinians of of being taught things in their in their books, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2811.9s)]
*  the Palestinians are taught to hate. Well, now we're getting a real demonstration of who's being [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2816.46s)]
*  taught to hate. Yeah, that last panel on that next page. Meanwhile, those still keeping records [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2820.38s)]
*  in Gaza would have to adapt to circumstances. The birth certificate and the death certificate [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2828.06s)]
*  were hereafter merged into the same form. Then you bring us back to Abu Ghraib. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2833.42s)]
*  How many more times do we need to be reminded of our shared values with Israel? Honestly, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2843.1s)]
*  we were already convinced. And by the way, are we still giving points for democracy? I think that's [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2849.1s)]
*  an extremely important point. Israel is us. I mean, we behave no different in Iraq. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2855.1s)]
*  No, that's it. Exactly. I mean, we were often talking about our shared values with Israel. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2859.74s)]
*  And yeah, we do have shared values with Israel. But what are those values? That's the question. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2864.7s)]
*  You throw in ancient Athens. But it's an important point. Even ancient Athens, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2869.58s)]
*  the greatest example of pure democracy the West has ever known, famously left out women [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2877.98s)]
*  and depended on slave labor to make its political experiment work. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2882.86s)]
*  And speaking of ancient Athens, let me just interject there that even the [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2889.2599999999998s)]
*  And speaking of ancient Athens, let me just interject there that even Aristotle [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2894.06s)]
*  did not envision the end of slavery. No, he thought it was a natural thing for [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2901.1s)]
*  certain people. They were natural slaves. Right. And speaking of ancient Athens, this is you, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2906.86s)]
*  a drawing of you as usual with your glasses with no eyes. And speaking of ancient Athens, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2915.9s)]
*  have we all read Thucydides? Do we all recall the story of the island state of [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2923.34s)]
*  Milos? And then you talk about the island state of Milos. Tell us what happened. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2930.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, the Athenians, the great Democrats, the Athenians had their own empire. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2936.2200000000003s)]
*  And they wanted the state of the island state of Milos to join their alliance. And the people on [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2942.78s)]
*  Milos didn't want that. So Athens basically descended upon them, killed every man, and took [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2951.98s)]
*  all the women and children into slavery, and then sent colonists, Athenians, to take over the homes [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2959.7400000000002s)]

*  democracies can commit atrocities. I don't, I prefer a democracy. I want a democracy. I, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2980.06s)]
*  that's the political system that I would fight for. But a democracy itself is not a moral, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2987.66s)]
*  it's, there's no, there's no morality behind democracy itself. I mean, it's the people, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=2994.86s)]
*  it's the, it's what, what the people decide. And democracies are very good about excluding [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3000.06s)]
*  people. They're very, very good about saying these are the people that have these rights, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3005.26s)]
*  and these are the people on the outside. And the people on the outside, it's, there's often not an [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3011.82s)]
*  attempt to bring them in. I think that's true with, definitely true with the Athenians, who was in and [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3016.62s)]
*  who was out. And it's definitely true with us. So I don't like the idea when democracy is used as [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3022.78s)]
*  sort of a, well, you can't talk about them doing this because they're a democracy, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3029.34s)]
*  or democracy somehow washes some atrocity away. It doesn't. Democracies commit atrocities. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3035.1000000000004s)]
*  Towards the end of the book, you say, we know how this ends. The warmongers, one thinks of [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3046.5400000000004s)]

*  Nobel Committee for its prize. It reminds me of the website at Columbia University, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3058.3s)]
*  where they proudly show pictures of student protesters from 1968. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3064.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, there you go. I mean, it's just like continual hypocrisy. You know, now we can talk about [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3070.7000000000003s)]
*  these fine students, but, but the, you know, in 68, who took over these buildings, it almost becomes [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3077.1800000000003s)]

*  There's just hypocrisy in those academic institutions, definitely. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3094.46s)]
*  Yeah. Great. Thanks, Joe. And I want to thank Sophia, Max, Thomas, and Diego, who produced the [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnrzKUBt9vU&t=3098.14s)]
