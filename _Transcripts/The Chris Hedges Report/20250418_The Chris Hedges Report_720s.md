# The Deal BEHIND the New Deal is COLLAPSING (w/ Richard Wolff)
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w)
*  So, let's talk about late stage capitalism, the hollowing out of state institutions, Doge, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=0.0s)]
*  and what the capitalists in the short term, of course, are going to make lots of money, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  but what it's going to do to the rest of us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=24.36s)]
*  Well, I think your opening, Chris, as often your openings are, is wonderfully comprehensive. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=28.16s)]
*  It leaves me kind of amazed at how much more I can provide in the way of specifics and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=37.04s)]
*  concreteness. I won't be departing. I think you've captured it really very, very well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=44.16s)]
*  But let me drive some of the points home. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Part of what you're watching with the Trump administration can be, and in my judgment, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=54.88s)]
*  ought to be understood as a war on the working class at home, but also abroad. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=60.72s)]
*  What is being done—let me start at the opposite end—what is being done in Europe is remarkable. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=70.08s)]
*  A deal that came out of World War II, in which the United States would defeat the new enemy, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=77.36s)]
*  the Soviet Union, barely a few months after being the great ally. It became overnight [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=84.8s)]
*  the great enemy, showing a kind of flexibility which is at once astonishing, but also impressive [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=91.68s)]
*  in terms of meeting your own needs and rearranging the pieces on the board that you're playing with. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=98.88s)]
*  The deal that was made was the following. We, the United States, we have two big worries right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Number one, the New Deal. An awful lot of money was taxed or borrowed from rich corporations and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=113.92s)]
*  the wealthy people to provide a remarkable array of mass services, unemployment insurance, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=121.84s)]
*  a minimum wage, the Social Security system, government employment. This had to be rolled [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=129.84s)]
*  back. And as you know very well, our last 50 years are the story of the rollback of that New Deal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=138.24s)]
*  But it also required smashing the Socialists and Communists who had created that New Deal [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=146.8s)]
*  with their alliance for a while with the Democratic Party. All of that had to be undone [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  and was undone. The second great anxiety at the end of the war was that we would fall back into [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=161.2s)]
*  a depression. Let's remember it was only the war that finally got us out of the horrible collapse [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  of capitalism, the worst in its history, from 1929 to 1940-41. And only by taking the remaining [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=175.28s)]
*  many, many millions of people, putting—I'm going to be simple now—putting half of them in uniform [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=184.56s)]
*  and the other half making the uniforms, we were able—and then the great worry, and it was very [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=190.8s)]
*  serious—at the end of the war, 1945, what would now happen? We would demobilize all these people [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=197.36s)]
*  out of the military, out of producing for the military. What would prevent us from slipping [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  back? And you can see the government did extraordinary things, the GI Bill, to take all [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  those soldiers and instead of having them go into their unemployment, stick them in the university [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  the government would pay for it, the housing program, the highway program, all of them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=224.48s)]
*  But what people don't recognize was that there was another part of this, and that was the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=229.52s)]
*  international part with Europe. The problem was Europe had the same depression history [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=234.72s)]
*  as this country did, and during that time, as in the United States, socialist and communist parties [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=241.6s)]
*  became much stronger than they had ever been in Europe. So at the end of the war, you had the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=248.8s)]
*  worry about slipping back, but you had an even bigger one, that you had very strong socialist [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  and communist parties who had led the movement of the 1930s to get social services, which were much [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  more generous in Europe than they were in this country. Plus, the socialists and communists [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  provided the militants who were the anti-fascist resistance. So they were popular, they were strong. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=274.96s)]
*  De Gaulle's first government after 45 had to have communist party people in the cabinet for Italy. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=281.76s)]
*  The second biggest party in the 20 years after the war was the Italian Communist Party, and I could [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=289.12s)]
*  go on. And they all had the Soviet Union literally a few hours by train from them. So their [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=294.88s)]
*  capitalist classes were even more freaked out about what was going on, and then the alliance [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=302.96s)]
*  with the Soviet Union, it was all too much. So what the United States did is cut a deal. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=309.2s)]
*  We will solve our economic problem by putting Keynesianism on steroids. The government is going [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=316.32s)]
*  to come in and do what? Save us from the Soviet menace, build up the military industrial, and say [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=323.84s)]
*  to the Europeans, we'll take care of it. We'll provide you with the defense umbrella, we'll divide [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=331.76s)]
*  you with all the support, and all you have to do is make sure you crush the socialists and communists [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  at home, and you are a good bulwark against the Soviet Union. And to that end, here's what we're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  going to do. You won't have to cover defense. We're taking care of that with our domestic Keynesian, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=353.76s)]
*  military Keynesianism. And you're going to take the money you would have had to spend to provide [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=360.8s)]
*  the social services that will allow you to compete with what the Russians are offering [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=367.92s)]
*  their people, and had been already for quite a while at that time. So you're going to compete [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  with them, and then we're going to take our National Endowment for Democracy, our CIA, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=378.0s)]
*  and all the rest, and make sure the right politicians willing to commit to this deal sit [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=383.84s)]
*  at the top of the government in France, in Germany, in Britain. And we all know the story of all the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  money and the sloshing that was done. That was it. That was the way we were going to destroy [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=397.12s)]
*  the socialists and communists inside, and weaken or destroy, if we could, the one outside. And all of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  it justifying the massive government spending. But the problem is, all of that was paid for, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=412.96s)]
*  to touch on your point, by debt. The United States does not like to fight wars with taxes. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=420.56s)]
*  It likes to fight wars with money borrowed. Because if you tax the people, the opposition [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  to the war would be much bigger and much arise much sooner. So you can't do that. You borrow the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  money. Here's the irony. The Europeans were major lenders for a while to the United States, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=438.72s)]
*  to fund the Keynesianism that protected them from having to use their money for their own defense. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=445.76000000000005s)]
*  The ironies of how this all fit together are a charming story that's never quite been put down [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  on paper. What we have now is the collapse of that deal. It's very important historically. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=459.28s)]
*  And I know you do the history too, Chris, something we have in common, which I think is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=468.88s)]
*  part of whatever effect we have. The story, it fits together our situation coming out of World [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=473.84s)]
*  War II and working out this way for another lease on life with lots of domestic government spending. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=481.04s)]
*  But the problem is, so much of it was done on debt. And so much of it was done without understanding [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=489.68s)]
*  of the special moment. The United States had no competitor coming out of World War II. Britain, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=499.04s)]
*  France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, they were all destroyed. We came out king of the hill. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=505.28s)]
*  Our economy was in better shape coming out of the war than it was going in, and no one else could say [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=512.72s)]
*  that. And the result was a very bizarre, unique, special moment that could not possibly last. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=518.64s)]
*  I think historians will look back, be rather impressed it lasted as long as it did. But in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=528.4s)]
*  any case, it is now over. You can't do it. The United States lost the war in Vietnam. It lost it [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=534.08s)]
*  in Iraq. It's losing it in Ukraine. I mean, look at it. And these are among the poorest countries on [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=542.72s)]
*  earth to which the US is losing. And the Europeans are left in a way one almost has to sympathize. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  They're irrelevant. They've become the literal opposite of what they were three or four centuries [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=558.96s)]
*  ago. The center of the universe, the apogee of culture, the colonial master, all of that. It's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=566.0s)]
*  all gone. Europe is a footnote. Living in a world of fantasy where being unable to stop the Russians [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=572.88s)]
*  with the United States, they actually think that they're going to do it without the United States. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=583.2s)]
*  These are levels of craziness that are part of the decline, I suspect, of all empires [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=592.0s)]
*  when they consume themselves. Last point. I am particularly struck with this crazy business [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=599.84s)]
*  of attacking federal employees in the name of efficiency. That is so laughable that one has to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=609.44s)]
*  kind of take a deep breath because it's sort of overwhelming what you get here. Two and a half [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=618.32s)]
*  million civilian employees of the federal government versus five million working for [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=624.8800000000001s)]
*  state government and 15 million working for the local government. If you care to damn [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=632.6400000000001s)]
*  about efficiency, whatever that exactly means, your obvious targets would be local and state, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=638.8s)]
*  but they can't get at those, so they go after the federal. That's not a decision of efficiency. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=645.28s)]
*  That's a decision of where can we make a public performance, and they're making a public performance. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=651.12s)]
*  It ruins the lives of those people. It destroys whatever function these agencies often had. It [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=657.92s)]
*  drives people entering the labor force, which is a larger number than those leaving the federal. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=664.32s)]
*  They're all going to go into the private sector where they're going to bid down wages. At the same [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=671.2s)]
*  time that they can't control the inflation, you're ripping up your working class more and more and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=676.32s)]
*  more, as if there were no end to this process. These are the desperate behaviors of a dying [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=683.2s)]
*  empire. There's really no other framework that I can think of that makes sense of this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxPnSl1pK4w&t=692.24s)]
