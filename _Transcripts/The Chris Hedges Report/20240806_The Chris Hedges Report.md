# What He Saw in Gaza Will Shock You
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDr-ifsoZoc)
*  So, Atif, as you mentioned, you lose your sister-in-law and her husband when their building
*  is bombed.
*  You're right, the bodies of their daughter and grandchild had already been retrieved.
*  The only known survivor was Wissam, one of their other daughters, who had been taken
*  to the ICU.
*  Wissam had gone straight into surgery, where both of her legs and her right hand had been
*  amputated.
*  Her graduation ceremony from art college had taken place only the day before.
*  She has to spend the rest of her life without legs, with one hand.
*  And you visit her in the hospital, and she's barely awake, and after half an hour she asks
*  you, I'm dreaming, right?
*  And you say, we are all in a dream.
*  And she says, my dream is terrifying, why?
*  And you answer, all our dreams are terrifying.
*  After ten minutes of silence, she said, don't lie to me, uncle.
*  In my dream, I don't have legs.
*  It's true, isn't it?
*  I have no legs.
*  But you said, it's a dream, you tell her.
*  I don't like this dream, uncle.
*  And you're right, I had to leave.
*  For a long ten minutes, I cried and cried, overwhelmed by the horrors of the past few
*  days.
*  I walked out of the hospital and found myself wandering the streets.
*  I thought idly we could turn this city into a film set for war movies.
*  And then when you go back to visit her, and there are no painkillers or sedatives, and
*  she's wracked in pain, she asks you for a lethal injection.
*  And she tells you that Allah will forgive her.
*  And you answer, but he will not forgive me, Wissam.
*  And she answers, I'm going to ask him to on your behalf.
*  I want you to talk a little bit about Wissam and that moment.
*  I never read the book after I wrote it.
*  I told you.
*  I don't dare to read the text.
*  I don't, you know.
*  Even when I talk about the book in the Mancairo reparto in Morocco, my only condition was
*  not to reparto the book.
*  Because, you know, they would ask you to read them.
*  It's about your book.
*  So I told you, Wissam was in Qatar, actually, where we managed, you know, luckily, I communicated
*  with some persons in the Qatar government and they transmitted her to Qatar.
*  Hopefully, and she's undergoing three surgeries and operations on August, 15th August, to
*  prepare her to have artificial limbs, you know, legs in.
*  I remember, you know, how it goes.
*  When I found my wife, you know, saying, you know, she knew the news.
*  It wasn't the news.
*  Then she says, nobody survived, not even a single person.
*  Then I went, wow, Wissam survived.
*  Can you believe?
*  You know, you're talking about to a person who lost all her family because she doesn't
*  have brothers and sisters.
*  So her only sister.
*  And of course, with her kids and her wife.
*  And so for Wissam, you know, when she was in the house, the bomb, the explosion took
*  the place and she was thrown to the next house without legs or a hand.
*  And they carried her and they took her to the hospital, of course, you know, she was
*  unconscious. So for her, you know, the last thing she remembers, she was laying in bed
*  opposite her mother.
*  Like they were making like this and talking.
*  So for for.
*  She doesn't remember anything.
*  But I think it's as later on, she told me in Cairo when I just stood there in the
*  hospital in Cairo, she realizes that when they carried her, she was with no legs.
*  And she felt that, you know, her legs were amputated, you know, and and so for her, it's
*  like most of people, Chris, it's a nightmare.
*  It's a movie. It's, you know, something that you don't believe, you know, or you don't
*  want actually to believe.
*  Just you.
*  You wish this dream like anything now, Chris, every night before I sleep, my wife has to
*  cry and to tell me, wow, what if this is a nightmare?
*  And after 300 days, because in this nightmare, which she wants to wake up on, she lost as
*  she was sitting there.
*  You know, when you catch your mobile, you find people to call from your family.
*  But when I catch it, no person.
*  Her sister, her brother-in-law, her two kids, who are not kids, they are 25, 28, the sons
*  of her daughter, her sister and her mother.
*  It's all family. So it's only her sixes, 76, you know, her 76 father was still alive
*  and his very own man for her.
*  So she says, when you catch your mobile and you find numbers to call, I don't find
*  numbers to call.
*  And so every night she says what Sam said to me at that day.
*  But if this is a dream, nightmare, horror movie, even if in this movie I lost my legs
*  or in this nightmare, I lost my legs on my arm.
*  But everybody, you know, I didn't, I don't know why, okay, I know we're running out of
*  time, but when I saw, when I left my dad in Japan, he refused to come with me to Rafa'a
*  and the South and said, listen, Atif, you know, I lived all my life here and if Allah
*  wants me to die, I will die here.
*  I'm going to die here.
*  And he died actually there.
*  But he died because he didn't find the bread tree either.
*  For 10 days he didn't find the bread tree.
*  He was eating the animal's, you know, seeds, you know, the seeds which you feed the animal
*  with.
*  Anyway, so I remember when I looked to his face for the last time before driving, I was
*  asking Allah just one favor, but he didn't do it for me.
*  I said, just I want to see him again.
*  Because I had this since I might not see him again.
*  And until now, many times I just think for a while, what if this is just another story
*  talk I'm telling to the nation, to the readers, like I'm making up all this work as a writer,
*  and you do it as a writer.
*  But if this is just one of my creations, you know, and I wish it is actually, and all our
*  talk now is part of this actually, is part of this fictitious universe of our world which
*  I make to fill it out.
*  Great.
*  Yeah.
*  Thank you, Atif.
*  That was Atif Abu Saif.
*  We're talking about his book, Don't Look Left, a Diary of Genocide.
*  I want to thank Sophia, Diego, Thomas, and Max, who produced the show.
