Even if Israel was carrying out its genocidal campaign against Gaza with the intent to "defend itself" â€” it doesn't preclude the Zionist state from genocide.

# U.N. Special Rapporteur Explains 'Intent' w Genocide
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKf7_hlHigU)
*  I want to ask before we get into the specifics in your report, you write perpetrators of
*  genocide almost always allege their actions were taken pursuant to an ongoing military
*  conflict. Yet genocide may be a means for achieving military objectives just as readily
*  as military conflict may be a means for instigating a genocidal plan. And then you write genocidal
*  intent may exist simultaneously with other ulterior motives. One of the mantras certainly
*  within the U.S. press, the U.S. media landscape is Israel's right to defend itself, Israel's
*  right to defend itself as if that precludes the possibility of genocide. And you make
*  that distinction in your report that it doesn't. There are three layers that need to be understood
*  here. The first is that even when a state has the right to defend itself from an attack or a serious
*  threat of an attack, it cannot commit genocide. And the fact that the court, the International
*  Court of Justice, the Supreme Organ of the United Nations had already identified this possibility,
*  this likelihood should have put Israel on notice, did put Israel on notice and should have been an
*  alarm for the entire international community, which should have not acted business as usual as of
*  then. And instead this has not happened. But also I say in the report, people tend to confuse
*  motives with intent. Intent is the determination is when an individual or here in the report,
*  I'm talking of state responsibility because this is critical and I would be very happy to unpack
*  that later. But it's the determination to destroy a group in whole or in part. And the mastermind
*  behind it might have the most different motives. Might want to do that to stay in power. Might
*  want to do that because they have this is seen as a way to liberate the hostages or might want to do
*  that because they feel entitled to eradicate a political entity or its armed wing. The motives
*  are irrelevant in international criminal law. In the case of genocide, we need to look at the
*  intent. What eventually has manifested like mens rea, like the mind that want to destroy. This is
*  why we need to be very, very clear because I hear people saying, no, but Israel doesn't want to
*  commit genocide. They want to liberate the hostages as if it was another intent that could be
*  inferred. No, no, it's not. First of all, as you know from the report, as you have read it,
*  and I debunk both the argument that it was even a motive, the liberation of the hostages. This is a
*  mantra or a refrain that has helped Israel continue to fund the flames of
*  attack against Gaza. So I debunk that and I debunk the argument of eradicating Hamas.
*  But let's spend the word on self-defense because as you rightly point out, and it's shocking for me
*  to see that the member states continue to talk about the right of self-defense as if it was
*  an existential, as if Israel was facing an existential threat that legitimated its
*  like wholesome war against another people. There is no self-defense that Israel can invoke against
*  the people it maintains under occupation because look, the only context in which a state can invoke
*  self-defense is when it's attacked or by another state or the use of hostages authorized by the
*  Security Council. There is no Security Council resolution authorizing Israel to wage a war,
*  but why so? Because Israel cannot wage a war against the population it maintains under occupation
*  because this population has the right to resist an unlawful occupation. Now when I say that,
*  I infuriate many because they say, oh, you see she's justifying violence. No, I'm just saying
*  what international law says because again, states have the right to defend themselves and so have
*  the people, especially people whose right of self-determination has not yet materialized
*  and therefore there would be a conflict within international law itself if self-defense took
*  precedence over the right of self-determination. Israel, the only way for Israel to protect itself,
*  which is its sacrosanct right, is to withdraw from what remains a historical Palestine,
*  withdraw the occupation, withdraw the settlements, withdraw its exploitation of
*  Palestinians resources as it has been ordered by the International Court of Justice in July
*  this year and then stop practicing apartheid against the Palestinians, including those
*  with Israeli citizenship.
