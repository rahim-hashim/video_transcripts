# Robert Fisk and the Great War for Civilization (w Lara Marlowe)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCBujuk6g48)
*  There are few reporters I admire more than Robert Fisk who died in 2020 and who spent
*  over four decades covering the Middle East. His book, The Great War for Civilization,
*  is a masterpiece. He remains a vital book for understanding the modern Middle East.
*  Arabic speaker, his reporting spanned the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. He was one
*  of the very few Western reporters to interview Osama bin Laden. The Civil War and Israeli
*  occupation in 1982 of Lebanon, the Iran-Iraq War, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Saddam Hussein's
*  invasion of Kuwait and the US invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. He was unsparing in his reporting
*  on the apartheid state of Israel covering the first and second indifatas or uprisings by the
*  Palestinians. He documented the brutal repression of the Islamic movement and civil war in Algeria,
*  spent considerable time in Iran and Lebanon where he was based. Most important, he saw war up close
*  and did not flinch from describing its senseless brutality, the bungling of Western governments,
*  the despotic Arab regimes that have sold out their own people and the Palestinians, the lies
*  told to mask war crimes and the suffering of those, including children, caught in the terrible
*  maw of war. The power of his book is not simply his lyrical writing and dogged reporting but his
*  area edition. He had a PhD in political science from Trinity College, Dublin. He was acutely
*  aware that without historical context nothing that takes place in the Middle East can be
*  understood. He distrusted all authority, a distrust no doubt spawned by being packed off as a young
*  boy as I was to a boarding school and experience we both loathed. He excoriated the sententious
*  mandarins in the press who eat out of the hands of government and military sources and function
*  as stenographers for power. He knew who he was writing for, those the world forgets, those whose
*  voices are silenced, those who suffer, those who are reviled, and he had an unflagging commitment
*  to the truth even when it reflected badly on those such as the Palestinians he cared about.
*  Terrorism is a word that has become a plague on our vocabulary. The excuse and reason and moral
*  permit for state-sponsored violence, our violence, which is now used on the innocent of the Middle
*  East ever more outrageously and promiscuously, he writes. Terrorism, terrorism, terrorism. It has
*  become a full stop, a punctuation mark, a phrase, a speech, a sermon, the be-all and end-all of
*  everything that we must hate in order to ignore justice and occupation and murder on a mass scale.
*  Terror, terror, terror, terror. It is a sonata, a symphony, an orchestra, turned to every television
*  and radio station and news agency, the soap opera of the devil, served up on primetime or distilled
*  in wearyingly dull and mendacious form by right-wing commentators on the American East Coast or the
*  Jerusalem Post or the intellectuals of Europe. Strike against terror, victory over terror, war
*  on terror, everlasting war on terror. Rarely in history have soldiers and journalists and presidents
*  and kings aligned themselves in such thoughtless unquestioning ranks. In August 1914 the soldiers
*  thought they would be home by Christmas. Today we are fighting forever. The war is eternal. The enemy
*  is eternal, his face changing on our screens. Once he lived in Cairo and sported a mustache and
*  nationalized the Suez Canal. Then he lived in Tripoli and wore a ridiculous military uniform
*  and helped the IRA and bombed American bars in Berlin. Then he wore a Muslim's imam's gown
*  and ate yogurt in Tehran and planned Islamic revolution. Then he wore a white gown and lived
*  in a cave in Afghanistan. And then he wore another silly mustache and resided in a series of palaces
*  around Baghdad. Terror, terror, terror. Finally he wore a kofi'a headdress and outdated Soviet-style
*  military fatigues. His name was Yasser Arafat and he was the master of world terror and then a
*  super statesman and then again a master of terror likened by his Israeli enemies to the terror
*  meister of them all, the one who lived in the Afghan cave. Joining me to discuss Robert Fiskes,
*  the great war for civilization as well as our own memoir, Love in a Time of War, My Years with
*  Robert Fiske, is the journalist Laura Marlow who was married to Robert and worked with him
*  from 1987 to 2003. One of the things, I think your book is a great companion to Robert's book
*  because while it's the story of your relationship, you certainly capture Robert who I knew very
*  well. But it also deals a lot with the mechanics of how you get stories which Robert doesn't do
*  so much of in the book. And I'd like to begin with, as both of you do in your books, with this
*  the shooting down of the Iranian airbus by the Vincent, the American warship.
*  I believe in your book you talk about it having a profound impact on you. And one of the things
*  I want you to do is not only describe what happened, and this just typifies almost every
*  story you and Robert covered, the lies that are told to cover up the reality.
*  I think we were on holiday in Ireland when we heard that the Americans had shot down a civilian
*  airliner flying over the Persian Gulf. And we basically raced to the airport, got on the first
*  flight to Dubai, and there were packs of journalists there all trying to get to Iran
*  to cover the tragedy. Actually Robert would dislike me calling it a tragedy, it was a war
*  crime really. The Iranian embassy wouldn't give any visas, wouldn't let anyone travel,
*  and this went on for maybe two or three days. And we spent a whole night trying to get a boat
*  across the Persian Gulf. And Robert at one point saw all of his colleagues, all of his competition
*  sail away towards Iran without him because they wouldn't let me on the boat because I had a U.S.
*  passport and there was a separate, different regulation for Brits. And he said, do you know
*  how much I love you? I just saw all my competition sail away without me. And he told me it was one of
*  the hardest decisions he'd ever made in journalism. So we went back to our hotel, I think it was the
*  International Hotel in Dubai very near the airport. And we were pretty exhausted, we'd been up all
*  night, bedraggled. And somebody ran into the lobby of the hotel saying, the Iranians are sending a
*  plane, the Iranians are sending a plane. So we raced to the airport, got on a civilian airliner,
*  not unlike the one which the Americans had just shot down a few days before, flew to Bandar Abbas.
*  The Iranians took all the journalists who were on the plane, dozens and dozens of us, to a cold
*  storage warehouse where the bodies of the, if my memory is correct, I think it was 263 people had
*  been killed. And there were piles of, well, they were lined up, the women in one row, the men in
*  another area, and then the people who they weren't able to put back together or didn't have recognizable
*  parts of. There were just parts, arms, legs, body organs piled up. It was pretty horrific.
*  And it was starting to smell because several days had passed. And I remember two bodies in
*  particular, there was one of the Revolutionary Guards said to me, you're a woman, so you're
*  allowed to look at her, because they wouldn't let men look at an Iranian woman, even dead.
*  And they opened, they were all sort of wrapped up in like plastic sheeting, and they unwrapped the
*  plastic around her. And there was a really beautiful woman with chestnut colored hair.
*  And she looked quite peaceful. I'd say she was in her late 30s, maybe early 40s. I can still
*  remember her face. And it's been, that was 1988. How many years is that? 46 years, something like
*  that. And then the other one I remember really well was a three year old girl called Layla
*  Bepehani. I even remember her name, who'd been on her way to a wedding. And she was wearing a
*  pale blue dress and little black patent leather shoes and tiny earrings. And her face was all
*  screwed up. She was crying. So she obviously realized something was wrong when she died.
*  And so after showing us this carnage, the Iranians took us to the former intercontinental hotel in
*  Bandar Abbas, and they prepared this big feast of, I think it was roast lamb. And I don't need to
*  tell you how sick I felt to the stomach having just been looking at all these dead bodies and
*  smelling dead bodies, which smell a bit like lamb. And so Robert and I were pretty horrified at this
*  feast they put on for us. And most of the journalists went in and sat down and ate lunch.
*  And Robert, this is one example of his incredible inventiveness as a journalist, started chatting
*  to the receptionist in the hotel and he said, you must have a telex machine. And they said, yes.
*  They said, oh, could I just say hello to the telex operator? And we went behind the reception
*  desk and Robert started sweet talking the telex operator who spoke English. And he got,
*  you know, asked permission, sat down at the tux machine and started writing his front page story
*  directly onto the tux machine, which amazed me. It really did. And then sure enough, the hotel
*  pulled the plug on the tux after a few minutes, but he must have got two or three hundred words
*  out anyway. And then we went to the, they took us back to the airport to fly back to Dubai.
*  And Robert found a coin telephone machine. I remember when we had pay telephones and
*  he managed to get Iranian coins from someone and he could, the figures, of course, are the same
*  in Farsi as in Arabic, their Arabic numerals. So he wrote down the phone number, which was on
*  the machine, called the switchboard of he was still with the times then in London and said,
*  call me back on this number. They called him back and he started dictating the rest of his story to
*  London. The Iranians had given none of us access to any kind of communication whatsoever. And
*  Robert's colleagues were furious that he had a front page story when they did not. We then flew
*  back to Dubai in the middle of the night. I was shattered because it was, we'd had two nights
*  without sleep and most of the journalists were just kind of, you know, lying back in their seats,
*  trying to recover their, their senses. Robert crept into the cockpit and interviewed the pilot
*  of the first Iranian aircraft to make the exact same journey from Bandar Abbas to Dubai since the
*  Americans, since the USS Vincennes had shot down the Airbus. And so we got another, a second
*  brilliant story out of it. The next day, the Times of London had been bought by Rupert Murdoch,
*  who, as you know, is very conservative, also owns the Wall Street Journal, Fox News. I don't need
*  to say more by way of explanation. Robert's foreign editor said, apparently it was a suicide
*  airliner. And Robert said, that's utter bullshit. It was a civilian airliner. I've seen the dead
*  civilians who died on it. And the pilot, the pilot he'd just interviewed knew the pilot of the Iranian
*  Airbus. And he said, you know, he was, he had also found some expert in Dubai who said that, told him
*  or the pilot had also told him that the military transponder on the USS Vincennes could not
*  communicate with the civilian airliner. They were on different frequencies. They could not hear each
*  other because the Americans kept saying, we warned them, we warned them, we warned them.
*  And they didn't respond to our warnings. Therefore they shot them down. And they also said the plane
*  was descending towards the ship. Yeah, they made it up. They completely made it up. And
*  so Robert was, I witnessed this argument in our hotel room in Dubai. He was yelling at his foreign
*  editor and saying, this is utter bullshit. You know, I forbid you to publish this. And
*  this eventually led to his resignation from the London Times and to his, you know, employment by
*  the London Independent for the last two or three decades of his life. Just this argument over the
*  USS Vincennes. And it all, you know, the subsequent investigations showed that Robert was absolutely
*  right. It was a civilian airliner. It was not descending. And what had happened was that Captain
*  Will Rogers III was in the toilet when his men saw this aircraft on their radar screens.
*  And they didn't know what to do. And there was sort of, I think they were yelling at him through
*  the toilet door, there's a plane coming at us. What do we do? What do we do? Fire on it, you know,
*  and they did. And they killed 263 people in cold blood. And what was really, really scandalous
*  is that the crew of the USS Vincennes were decorated. They received medals of
*  valor for having shot down a civilian airliner.
*  Yeah, and I believe the captain was promoted.
*  He was. There was years later, there was I think it was his wife's car in San Diego, California,
*  had a bomb placed in it. I don't think she was hurt. But that also showed the sort of the long
*  arm of Iran and its allies in the Middle East.
*  So the reason I wanted to begin with that story is because it illustrates several points that come
*  out in the book. First, how flagrantly those in authority everywhere lie. Israel lies like it
*  breathes, but so does the United States. Second of all, it illustrates he has a quote in the book,
*  he's quoting somebody about you need a little literary ability and rat like cunning,
*  which is so true.
*  Nicholas Tomlin, a British correspondent who was killed in the, I believe the 1973 Arab-Israeli
*  War. Yes. And Robert always said, especially rat like cunning.
*  Well, especially rat like cunning is correct. When I covered the Ceaușescu revolution,
*  same thing, you couldn't get a phone line for some weird reason in
*  Ceaușescu's Romania, Kent cigarettes were used as currency. So I went down to the hotel operators,
*  gave them all cartons of Kent. And then again, they use Deutschmark, not dollars, and said that,
*  I know how hard they worked and they weren't being paid very well. I can see Robert doing exactly
*  this. And that whenever they had to call the international phone exchange to get an open line,
*  which could take a very long time. And I said, look, every time you get an open line, call my
*  room and if I use it, I'll give you 10 Deutschmark. So every international call that came into the
*  hotel and all the bottom windows have been shot out by the securitate went to my room.
*  I never had any problem filing my stories, but I went down to the dining room, all the foreign
*  correspondents were enraged because they were waiting hours for an open line. This is a classic
*  example of rat like hunting and why you need it. And of course, Robert exhibited this in spades.
*  And then I also, also the other part of this story that's important is that Robert's commitment to
*  the truth that he and let's be clear. I mean, you know, as well as I do, probably the majority of
*  our colleagues are just consummate careerists. Their commitment is not to the truth. They're very
*  cynical. It's to their own advancement. And one of the reasons I admired Robert for many reasons,
*  but one of the reasons I admired him is his deep compassion, his deep empathy, but finally his
*  refusal to compromise his refusal to allow any publication that he worked for in a lie,
*  which of course left him leaving the paper. He was that you write in your own book,
*  which is a wonderful book, but you write, I think early on when you're with Robert, that your
*  competition was not another woman, but Beirut, the city of Beirut. And of course, I love it at
*  the beginning of, but shows you how naive you were. He promises that he'll stop war reporting
*  and move to Paris. And I love that passage because having done it, I knew Robert wasn't going to last
*  in Paris at all, no matter how much he loved you, it would make any difference. And of course,
*  next thing you know, you're back in Beirut trying not to get kidnapped. And you and I were in the
*  same room in Syria when Terry Anderson was released, who was what held for seven years,
*  the former AP bureau chief. But let's talk a little bit about Lebanon, especially of course,
*  the tragedy of what's happening. Robert was maybe the first, certainly one of the very first
*  reporters to get to Sabra and Shatila. This is where the phalangist Israeli armed backed
*  militias massacred. What's the exact number? 1000? I don't know the exact number.
*  And we never knew the exact number. It's certainly at least 1000.
*  At least 1000 Palestinian civilians. And Robert got in there while the fighting was still going on.
*  And that affected him deeply. And he, in a way, so much of his four decades,
*  he, while the rest of the world was willing to forget the Palestinians, he wouldn't.
*  Of course, another reason that however unpopular it was, however much he was attacked, which he was
*  repeatedly for being an anti-Semite, all of this kind of stuff. But and I think that that is another
*  mark of a great journalist, in a way, because that is the story. The editors may not recognize
*  it's the story. The public may not recognize it's the story. But you know it's the story.
*  Can you talk about that? About Beirut or the Palestinians or Sabra and Shatila?
*  About all of it. About Sabra and Shatila, how it affected him, and just Robert's determination
*  to tell the story of the Palestinians. I mean, frankly, when not a lot of other people were
*  telling that story. Yeah. Well, Sabra and Shatila, I think, marked him more than any other story.
*  It's the only thing that I ever knew to give him nightmares. He would wake up sometimes,
*  dreaming that he was buried under earth because the philandrist had bulldozed the bodies of the
*  victims of Sabra and Shatila into these sort of big earthen banks. And Robert was actually climbing
*  over one of these earthen banks, not realizing that they were bodies, when he looked down and saw
*  a human face under his foot. And he screamed and jumped off. But it was something that really
*  haunted him. And he went back. He was in the habit of taking visitors to Beirut,
*  including some of his editors, to Sabra and Shatila. He didn't want it to be forgotten.
*  In fact, I worked for Time magazine then. And they at one point were going to bring the Time
*  magazine news tour, which was that they put the 80 richest men in America on a plane and flew them
*  around the world. And they were going to stop in Beirut. And with Robert's help, I organized a
*  visit to Sabra and Shatila, which never happened because the Clinton White House told them not to
*  go to Beirut. But I had found eight or ten families and written up the history of each family,
*  where they came from in Palestine and so on and so forth. And they would have, thanks to Robert,
*  would have seen Sabra and Shatila many years later. But they would have seen what had happened
*  there. And actually, the camps hadn't changed all that much. You still had these shanties and the
*  open sewers and the poverty, the dirt roads. You could still see the Kuwaiti embassy, where the
*  Israeli army was ensconced and from which they watched the massacre being carried out.
*  So Sabra and Shatila really, I think, changed Robert and reinforced his belief that the
*  Palestinian question was the linchpin of the whole Middle East problem. And he believed very
*  strongly that as long as there was not some kind of justice for the Palestinians, as long as they
*  didn't have a state, there could never be peace in the Middle East. And I think we're seeing that
*  proven very sadly yet again now in 2024. He was absolutely right. And even when everyone else would
*  forget about the Palestinians, Robert never did. When the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993,
*  Robert said immediately, this isn't going to work and the Palestinians will get blamed for it. And
*  that's exactly what happened. It didn't work and the Palestinians got blamed for it. And he said
*  the Israelis had, I think it was 250 lawyers or something working on the agreement. And the
*  Palestinians were, it was Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas pretty much all alone, all by themselves.
*  And Robert felt that they'd been hoodwinked. And I think that what happened subsequently showed that
*  he was right about that as well. Yes, he felt very, very strongly about the truth and that
*  one should tell it. Actually, the Irish Nobel laureate who Robert and I both knew, Seamus Heaney,
*  wrote, said once that there is such a thing as truth and it can be told. And I always remember
*  that quote and I think it really sums up what Robert was all about.
*  One of the things I just want to touch on before we go on, he schooled me on Oslo.
*  I was a bit naive about Oslo and I remember him laying out and him being, of course, as he almost
*  always was, completely correct as to why it wouldn't work. But one of the things, it comes
*  through more in your book actually than in his, is the importance of literacy in terms of being
*  a great writer. Both you and he, you quote a lot of poetry, you both loved poetry, he wrote poems
*  to you. I used to write poetry but I'm a good enough writer to know I'm a bad poet. But
*  it read not just, he had a voracious appetite for history as you point out in your book,
*  especially World War II. But you can't understand what's happening around you
*  unless you understand the roots, unless you understand the context, unless you understand
*  the history. And that's what makes his book such an amazing work. And I would argue,
*  probably the most important work, I can't think of another book that's more important for
*  understanding the modern Middle East. And posthumously he has a new book, what's it called?
*  I haven't read it yet. It's called Night of Power, which is the night when Allah dictated
*  the Quran to Muhammad. Right, it's a very special day for Muslims, yes. Exactly, and the subtitle of
*  it is the betrayal of the West's betrayal of the Arabs, I think. Well, that's what that's,
*  I think what's so important about his book is that by the time you finish, and it's long,
*  but it's beautifully written, it is that you just see betrayal after betrayal after betrayal.
*  These betrayals are forgotten by us, but they're not forgotten by Palestinians or Iraqis or
*  Iranians or everyone else. And that's what makes the book so important. The other thing that
*  Robert understood is Israel. He understood the Israelis, he understood how they thought,
*  and why they did what they did. I'm just going to read this little passage. This is from Robert's
*  book, Netanyahu's most damaging flaw, his failure to regard the Palestinians as fellow
*  humans, his conviction that they are no more than a subject people. This characteristic comes across
*  equally clearly in his book, A Peace Among Nations, which might have been written by a
*  colonial governor. Clinton got it right. He understood the psychological defect that lay
*  at the heart, not just of Netanyahu's policy, but of the whole Netanyahu government. Yet within just
*  a few days, he's talking about Netanyahu, he was presiding over yet another peace accord at Wye,
*  which effectively placed the Palestinians in the role of supplicants. The main section in the Wye
*  agreement was not about withdrawals, but about security. And this was liberally laced with
*  references to terrorists, terrorist cells and terrorist organizations involving, of course,
*  only Palestinian violence. There was not a single reference to killers who had come from Jewish,
*  from the Jewish settler community. Arafat's torture was exquisite. Each new accord with
*  Israel involved a subtle rewriting of previous agreements. Madrid, with all its safeguards for
*  the Palestinians, turned into Oslo, no safeguards at all, and a system of Israeli withdrawal that
*  was so constructed that deadlines no longer had to be met. This turned into the 1997 Hebron Accord,
*  which allowed Jewish colonists to stay in the town and made an Israeli withdrawal contingent
*  upon an end to anti-Israeli violence. In 1998, the Wye agreement even dropped the Land for Peace
*  logo. It was now billed as the Land for Security Agreement, peace being at least temporarily
*  unobtainable. Peace means respect, mutual trust, cooperation. Security means no violence,
*  but it also means prison, hatred, and as we already knew, torture. In return, the Palestinians
*  could have 40 percent of their territory under their control as opposed to 90 percent they
*  expected under Oslo, and the CIA, the most trustworthy and moral of institutions, would be
*  in the West Bank to ensure that Arafat arrested the usual suspects. He totally captured this process
*  by which Israel makes an agreement, which is always open-ended, always done in stages,
*  and then rolls it backward, rolls it backward, rolls it backward, which of course we're now
*  witnessing with the areas A, B, and C in the West Bank, which have been violated. I think the
*  Palestinians, I may have the figure wrong, are allowed to control on their own about 19 percent
*  of the West Bank, but now you have the settlers making incursions into Ramallah. And that was
*  it wasn't just his deep understanding of history. I love he went after Tony Blair, remember, as
*  what do you call him after Coute, the British disaster in World War I where they all got wiped
*  out. What did he call him? Tony Blair. Of Coute and Amara? Of Coute and Amara.
*  Yeah, because again the British and the Americans go into Iraq at quote-unquote as liberators,
*  and they almost replicate word for word Townsend's occupation of Iraq in World War I.
*  And it was a disaster then. I mean, he understands the cyclical patterns of history
*  when you don't understand history and you don't learn from it, but he also understood the psychology
*  of groups such as the Israelis. Absolutely. Absolutely. I think it's in the Great War for
*  Civilization he wrote that history is not only in the past, it projects itself into the future.
*  And he saw history as a continuum. I think that's one reason that his work was so admired,
*  it continues to be admired throughout the Middle East by Arabs and Iranians, because
*  Robert knew their history. And I'm very struck today as the world remembers the atrocities
*  committed by Hamas on October 7th, that there's a lot of commentary in the newspapers and on the
*  radio, but all of the commentary that I have heard from Israelis and Israeli citizens, and some of
*  them have suffered very greatly obviously, but it's as if the whole conflict started on October 7th,
*  2023. There is no mention ever of the context and the history of it. And I remember that when
*  the Secretary General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, said shortly after it happened, that one must also
*  consider the context and the history, the Israelis were outraged. They were absolutely outraged. And
*  I think that's part of what bothered them about Robert, was that he knew that and he would always
*  remind people of what happened the last time, and of Baruch Goldstein massacring Palestinians at
*  worship in Hebron, of the Israelis driving out 750,000 Palestinians from their homes in the Nakba,
*  in the catastrophe, and so on. So you're right, he had an incredible grasp of history. He also predicted
*  that the Oslo Accords would turn the Palestinians into the Israelis' policemen.
*  And that's exactly what happened. Exactly what the PA is, yeah. And which is why Abbas and the PA is
*  reviled. Yeah, I'm afraid you're right. I covered the Hebron massacre. I had to go interview all the
*  survivors from the New York Times. And to that point, I want to read another passage from his book,
*  because he, for all the reasons you said, he grasped where things came from. And I used to think
*  there were only two types of reporters. There were those reporters who didn't know what tomorrow's
*  story was and those that did. Robert always knew what tomorrow's story was. And when I was around
*  other reporters who were too obtuse to not know what tomorrow's story was, I never worried,
*  because I knew they'd be in the wrong place covering the wrong thing. Which is why, to be
*  completely honest, whenever I found myself in the same city, which happened several times,
*  including in Bosnia with Robert, it scared the hell out of me. Because I knew he'd be in exactly
*  the right place. He knew what tomorrow's story was. He writes, when a society is dispossessed,
*  when the injustice is thrust upon it appear insoluble, when the enemy is all-powerful,
*  when one's own people are bestialized as insects, cockroaches, and two-legged beasts, then the mind
*  moves beyond reason. It becomes fascinated in two senses with the idea of an afterlife and with the
*  possibility that this belief will somehow provide a weapon of more than nuclear potential. When the
*  United States was turning Beirut into a NATO base in 1983, and using its firepower against
*  Muslim guerrillas in the mountains to the east, Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Baalbek were
*  promising that God would rid Lebanon of the American presence. I wrote at the time, not entirely with
*  my tongue in my cheek, that this was likely to be a titanic battle. U.S. technology versus God. Who
*  would win? Then on the 23rd of October, 1983, a lone suicide bomber drove a truckload of explosives
*  into the U.S. Marine compound at Beirut Airport and killed 241 American servicemen in six seconds.
*  This, I am sure, was the suicide bomber to whom Nasrallah was referring, the one who drives into
*  the military base smiling and happy. I later interviewed one of the few surviving American
*  Marines to have seen the bomber. All I can remember, he told me, was that the guy was smiling.
*  I spent months studying the suiciders of Lebanon. They were mostly single men, occasionally women,
*  often the victims of Israeli torture or the relatives of family members who had been killed
*  in battle with Israel. They might receive their orders while at prayer in the masjid or mosque
*  in the south Lebanese villages. The imam would be told to use a certain phrase in his sermon,
*  a reference to roses or gardens or water or a kind of tree. The cleric would not understand the purpose
*  of these words, but in his congregation a young man would know that his day of martyrdom had arrived.
*  In Gaza, even before the Oslo agreement, I discovered an almost identical pattern. As in
*  Lebanon, the would-be martyr would spend his last night reading the Quran. He would never say a formal
*  goodbye to his parents, but he would embrace his mother and father, tell them not to cry if he were
*  one day to die. Then he would set off to collect his explosives. It's chilling, isn't it? Yeah.
*  But that's it. That's it. I know. I interviewed these people. He understood. He really made the
*  effort to understand why they did it. I think he came closer than anybody else in the West, any
*  non-Muslim, to understanding. He went and interviewed their families, their parents, their siblings.
*  One thing that often surprised me is that people, for example, Hassan Nasrallah, who was just
*  assassinated by Israel, lost his eldest son who was fighting the Israelis. He was killed by the
*  Israelis. He said he was honored and he wished he had more sons. He hoped that all of his sons
*  would be killed fighting the Israelis. I think that no matter how many aircraft carriers and
*  fighter jets and artillery shells and drones and no matter what the technology and the quantity
*  of the weapons at your disposal, it's very hard to defeat an enemy who is willing to die.
*  I think that's one advantage that the Americans and the Israelis simply don't have. They want to
*  live. Their soldiers want to live. I don't think they've ever understood this willingness to die
*  on the part of Hezbollah and Hamas and their other enemies in the Middle East.
*  That's how the Taliban drove the Americans out of Afghanistan. To that point, he writes,
*  today the Arabs are no longer afraid. The regimes are as timid as ever, loyal and supposedly
*  moderate allies obeying Washington's orders. Taking their massive subventions from the United
*  States, holding their preposterous elections, shaking in fear, at least their people at least
*  decide that regime change from within their societies, not the western version imposed by
*  invasion, is overdue. It is the Arabs as a people brutalized and crushed for decades by corrupt
*  dictators who are no longer running away. The Lebanese in Beirut under siege by Israel learn
*  to refuse to obey the invaders orders. The Hezbollah proved that the mighty Israeli army could
*  be humbled. The two Palestinian intifadas showed that Israel could no longer impose its will on an
*  occupied land without paying a terrible price. The Iraqis first rose up against Saddam and then,
*  after the Anglo-American invasion, against the occupation armies. No longer did the Arabs run
*  away. The old Sharon policy into which the American neoconservatives so fatally bought
*  before the 2003 invasion of Iraq of beating the Arabs till they came to heel or until they behave
*  or until an Arab leader can be found to control his own people is now as bankrupt as the Arab regimes
*  that continue to work for the world's only superpower. And of course we've seen that with
*  the genocide in Gaza. Whether it's Sisi's Egypt, King Abdullah's, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, they have
*  all been complicit in the genocide and I've spent several weeks in the Arab world since October 7th
*  while the rage on the street is directed not only at the Israelis for mass slaughter but at
*  their regimes for its complicity.
*  Yes, but I think that this fighting spirit, this anger which Robert referred to,
*  it doesn't mean that the downtrodden and prosecuted are always going to win. On the
*  contrary, I think what we're witnessing now in Israel, Palestine, I fear is the final ethnic
*  cleansing of the Palestinian people. I think especially if Donald Trump wins the election
*  on November 5th that he will give Netanyahu carte blanche to do whatever he wants and not just
*  Netanyahu, Ben Gevire and Smotrich and they will drive the Palestinians of Gaza into Egypt and they
*  will drive the Palestinians of the West Bank into Jordan and they will say the Palestinian problem
*  has been solved. And I remember very much an interview Robert and I did with a philosopher
*  called Liebowitz in Jerusalem. Yes, yes, Yashu Liebowitz. Exactly, exactly. I think it was
*  around the time of the first Intifada, if my memory is correct. And he said something I never
*  forgot. He said there is no necessity in history. It's not because we thirst for justice. It's not
*  because the Palestinians have been dispossessed. It's not because Arabs have been betrayed through
*  history that this will be righted. And I think that Liebowitz was right and Robert knew that,
*  but it didn't stop him quantitling what was happening and fighting for justice in his way
*  through his writing. No, and I do agree with you about certainly the intent of Israel.
*  Having just made two trips to Egypt, the Egyptian military has been quite categorical with Sisi that
*  no Palestinians will be allowed to come into the Sinai. Whether that continues, I don't know.
*  How big is Egypt's debt though? How many billion? 160 billion. And the point is Sisi is corrupt and
*  certainly would be willing to be bought off. My understanding is the military high command has
*  told him absolutely not. But things can change. We both know the intent of Israel, as you pointed out,
*  is to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians. Of course, the Jordanian military has moved up to
*  the border of the West Bank because they fear precisely what you said, ethnic cleansing of the
*  West Bank. Israel has already made it clear that they are going to, in essence, annex northern
*  Gaza and create this, or already have created, but even let this humanitarian catastrophe fester
*  in the South in the hopes that it does put enough pressure. But yes, I think that that is, and I
*  think it was the end of your book. I think it's the end of your book. You talk about how Robert
*  falls into a kind of despair because after over four decades, things are worse. And I believe he
*  even tells you in your book, or you quote him in your book, he thinks it wasn't worth it. Was that
*  a correct quote or something like that? No, he said that he feared that nothing he had written
*  had made any difference, which isn't exactly the same as saying it's not worth it. I think
*  that he's made a tremendous difference. I think that since October 7th, 2023, and the killing of
*  42,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and now with the killing of thousands of Lebanese going on,
*  I think that public opinion in the West is starting to shift, not among the leaders,
*  who are pretty gutless, but among the people and especially young people. And that's why we've seen
*  these mass demonstrations in many European countries, in the United States, we've seen the
*  student occupations of university campuses, and it has become possible to criticize Israel in a way
*  that was not possible before, even in mainstream media now, in newspapers like the New York Times,
*  you have editorialists saying very strident things against Netanyahu and against the slaughter of
*  Palestinians and Lebanese. So it's not changing as much as it should, or as fast as it should, or
*  probably in the way that Robert would have liked it to change, but it is making a difference. And I
*  think he did more than anyone else to prepare the ground for that change. I was very struck,
*  there's a young Irish novelist called Sally Rooney, who's written several enormous bestsellers about
*  young people in Ireland. And in one of her novels, one of the students at Trinity College Dublin
*  is reading Robert Fisk. And it's true that young people do read him a lot. And he used to tell
*  me that young people would come in droves to his lectures, and he got a lot of satisfaction out of
*  that, despite his feelings of despair over the unchanging nature of the Middle East and the
*  continued betrayal of the Arabs. There was a moment where he is attacked by a mob of Afghans,
*  and very severely beaten, and rescued finally by an Afghan, and probably might have been killed if
*  that stranger hadn't intervened. And I thought his response to that attack explained a lot about
*  who he was. Can you tell us that story? I know that he went back to the shop that was very
*  near to the place where he was dragged off the bus and beaten with rocks.
*  I saw him, our marriage was in difficulty then, but I went to Ireland to be with him a few weeks
*  after that happened. And he still had, you've probably seen the photographs of him with his
*  forehead sort of split open and bleeding. And he still had the scab on his forehead. And he was
*  very upset. And I think any of us would be to have an angry mob trying to stone us to death,
*  which is what happened. And they were holding rocks in their hands and hitting him with rocks.
*  He was very upset. He also thought it was very fishy because the only thing that they stole
*  was his contacts book. He had a beautiful burgundy colored leather, like a phylofax,
*  which I had given him as a gift, which had all of his contacts, I mean, all of the contacts,
*  for example, which had led him to Bin Laden. And it was all written in this tiny little
*  scroll of Roberts, which was very difficult to read. But that was gone. That was missing.
*  Nothing else. They didn't take his passport or his money. Nothing else. He wondered if
*  there was some intelligence service behind it, if somebody sold that contacts book.
*  He also told me that Daniel Pearl and his wife, I believe her name is Mary Ann, took him in and took
*  care of him when he got out of hospital after that horrible beating. And of course, Daniel Pearl was
*  later beheaded in Pakistan, which was also extremely upsetting to Robert.
*  He did, I know it was controversial. He said that he didn't blame the people who beaten him,
*  because he said if the Americans had just bombed my village and destroyed my house,
*  and I saw, which is pretty much what had happened in Afghanistan,
*  and I saw a Westerner on a bus on the Afghan-Pakistani border, I'd want to kill him too.
*  And I think a lot of his colleagues thought that was a very stupid thing to say. Fisk
*  forgives the people who nearly killed him. But that was his attitude. And that was Robert. He
*  always wanted to understand, he wanted to know the other person's point of view. And he would
*  often tell me if I'd had rows with editors, that sort of thing, he'd say, put yourself in their
*  place. Or if I sent a ratty message on the telex or by email, he'd say, now, how would it feel if
*  you received that message, Laura? And he had an infinite capacity to do that. And I think that
*  shows his humanity and the breadth of his spirit that he did that.
*  Steve McLaughlin Well, the ability to step into the shoes of others. I mean,
*  he had that. That's what made his reporting so tremendous. I'm going to disagree about foreign
*  editors. I covered the war in Salvador with all these old guys who'd covered the war in Vietnam.
*  And one of them said to me about foreign editors, never forget, they're the enemy. I think it was
*  Dyle Torrison, actually.
*  Laura Flanders Well, as I said, Robert had his rows too with the London Times. But he always
*  fought the good fight. And he stood up for himself. By God, he stood up for himself. And I
*  wouldn't have wanted to have been on the receiving end of a Fisk tirade because you couldn't defeat
*  him in an argument ever.
*  Steve McLaughlin Yeah, I had a few of those tirades. Copy editors, mangling your story.
*  So there's a kind of funny subtext to his book I want to ask you about. And that's his father,
*  Bill Fisk. He dedicates, he had a very contentious relationship with his father.
*  He dedicates the book, he dedicates Pity of the Nation to You. He dedicates the book to his
*  mother and father. His father had served in World War One. And he talks in the book about how when
*  his father's dying, I think to his regret, he does not go say goodbye to his father.
*  As a boy, his father takes him in summers off to World War One battlefields. But his father comes
*  up repeatedly in the book, which I find fascinating given the relationship that he had with his father.
*  And I just wondered if you could talk about that.
*  Anne-Marie Sallisbury Sure, sure. I knew his mother and father. His father died at the age of 93.
*  He was from the northwest of England. I think he was from Liverpool. Liverpool or Manchester.
*  I'm sorry, my memory is failing me. But his father's father had been the first maid on the Cuddy Sark,
*  which Robert was very proud of. But Bill, his father, had been married a first time to a woman
*  who apparently had just this incredible fear of sex. And I don't think they'd ever had sex. And
*  she died. And Robert actually came upon her grave in the local cemetery in Maidstone Kent and went
*  home and asked his father about it. His father said, Where did you hear about that boy? She was
*  called Winifred Fisk. Anyway, and then his father married Robert's mother, who was more than 20 years
*  younger than him, Peggy, who was a wonderful woman. She was very sunny disposition, very cheerful,
*  always optimistic. And I know that Robert got his optimism from Peggy. But his father always said,
*  he called him fella, which Robert that was ironic since fella came from fella heen, Arabic for a
*  peasant. He said, We've got to make a man out of you fella. And he sent him off to British public
*  school at the age of nine. So Robert went from having been this very spoiled only child, whose
*  mother used to bring him tea and toast in bed every morning, to a British public school, where
*  they were woken up at five in the morning and had cold showers in the morning and were bullied and
*  made to run and be cadets and military cadets and so on and so forth. And he hated it. He absolutely
*  hated it. And the first time he was allowed to go home for a weekend, he cried and cried and cried
*  and cried. And he said, Please don't send me back there. I hate it. I want to live at home with you.
*  And his mother said, Please, Bill, and his father said, No, we've got to make a man out of you.
*  And he hated his father, he really, really hated him. And it was only in the last years of his life
*  that he relented. He admitted that his father had taught him to love books and taught him to love
*  history. And he gave him credit for that. And he came to some kind of reconciliation. I think there
*  was a very strong Oedipal thing in there where Robert would probably hate me saying this, but
*  he and his father were both in love with his mother. And I think they were competing for her love.
*  And they were jealous of each other. And Robert's hatred of authority, I believe, came from that
*  relationship with his father. He was always he never trusted American or British authorities,
*  be they civil or military governments, he was always extremely cynical and skeptical. And
*  that that all goes back to his relationship with Bill Fisk.
*  I think it goes back to goes back to boarding school. I went to boarding school at 10 very similar.
*  And that's where I learned to totally hate all authority. Yeah, so those if you have a strong
*  will, their goal is to break you. And they break most people and break him. Obviously, we have to
*  mention the fact that and he does in his book that his father is detailed to carry out an execution
*  of a deserter and refuses and destroys his own career in the army because of it.
*  Yes. And Robert did recognize that as a heroic act. And he said it was the one thing that he
*  really loved about his father. And he was you know, it was it was kind of a love hate relationship.
*  He he when when his mother died, his father died before his mother,
*  about five years before we went to clear out his parents house. And Robert spent, I think we spent
*  about three weeks there because they had never like all the Second World War generation, they
*  had never thrown anything away. And Robert spent the whole three weeks in his father's library,
*  going through the books and choosing the ones he wanted to keep. And he he very much appreciated
*  his father's love of books and mostly history books. So I think you were talking earlier about
*  Robert's literary bent his skill as a writer, he could recite Shakespeare.
*  When he went to interview bin Laden that time in Afghanistan, near Jalalabad, he was reading
*  Tolstoy's War and Peace. And I think in Great War for Civilization, he talks about lying on the bed
*  in this awful hotel with the air conditioning leaking on him, reading War and Peace. So you have
*  this funny back and forth between, you know, bin Laden and Al Qaeda, and you know, the Napoleonic
*  Wars and Napoleon's invasion of Russia. But that was Robert, this incredible juxtaposition always of
*  literature and history, and the news and, you know, present day, which is very rare, but that
*  literature is extremely important, not only if you're a writer, but also if you want to understand
*  human nature, human psychology and how it works. And I know you quote Proust in your book, I'm a
*  huge Proust, I've read In Search of Lost Time three times, although not in French, unlike you.
*  And I actually read it the first time.
*  I only read it once, not three times.
*  What?
*  I said I only read it once, not three times.
*  Well, the first time I read it was in the war in Bosnia.
*  You have a lot, that's the other thing people don't know, you have a lot of dead time in war,
*  you're sitting around trying to wait to get to places.
*  Robert always told a story about his friend, Ed Cody of the Washington Post.
*  I knew Ed, Ed and I, Ed and I covered the war in Salvador together, yeah.
*  Yeah, Ed's a great guy. He used to, he speaks very good Arabic. I do say better than Robert,
*  but he would always, when he encountered an obstreperous militiaman who didn't want to let
*  him through a checkpoint, he would just pull a volume of verlin out of his pocket and sit down
*  by the road and start reading poetry. And he always had a little volume of something with him
*  for those occasions. And Robert enjoyed telling that story about Ed. He knew patience, which
*  Robert wasn't always quite so patient, but he knew how to charm people into letting them through
*  or not shooting them or whatever. Well, he was one of, you know, probably the greatest
*  reporter in the Middle East of our generation. That was Laura Marlowe on her book, Love in a
*  Time of War. And then we, of course, have been discussing Robert Fisk's masterpiece,
*  The Great War for Civilization. I think, Laura, you probably agree that if you want to understand
*  the modern Middle East, I don't think there's probably a better book out there. Absolutely.
