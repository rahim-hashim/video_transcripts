# Genocide as Colonial Erasure (w Francesca Albanese)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOfDPD9mxv4)
*  The latest United Nations report by Francesca
*  Albanese, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories
*  occupied since 1967, argues that the violence unleashed against the Palestinians after October
*  7 is not happening in a vacuum but as part of a long-term, intentional, systematic, state-organized
*  forced displacement and replacement of the Palestinians.
*  The report details how the ongoing genocide against the Palestinians is accelerating in
*  large part because of the complicity and indifference of the international community.
*  The report, released Monday, argues that if not halted, the mass slaughter and displacement
*  in Gaza of its 2.3 million residents, tactics increasingly being replicated in the occupied
*  West Bank, jeopardizes the very existence of the Palestinian people in Palestine.
*  It concludes with an urgent appeal to member states in the United Nations to intervene
*  before Palestinians, especially those in northern Gaza, which Israel appears intent on fully
*  depopulating and annexing, are driven from their homeland.
*  This intervention must, the report states, include a full arms embargo and sanctions
*  against Israel until the mass killing of Palestinians is halted, a permanent ceasefire is in place,
*  and Israeli occupation forces and Jewish colonists withdraw from occupied Gaza and the West Bank,
*  including East Jerusalem.
*  Absent this, the report recommends that Israel be formally recognized as an apartheid state
*  and persistent violator of international law, reactivating the UN special committee against
*  apartheid to address the situation in Palestine and potentially suspend Israel's membership
*  in the United Nations.
*  Joining me to discuss her report is Francesca Albanese.
*  Francesca, the report is devastating, as is of course every daily report out of Gaza and
*  the West Bank.
*  You write quite a lot of research out of the West Bank as well.
*  I want to begin with kind of the broader implications of Israel's genocide, which is at the conclusion
*  of your report before we go into the specifics, which is at the front of your report.
*  You note in the report that since your last report, and despite the International Court
*  of Justice interventions, genocidal acts have, in your words, proliferated.
*  Nearly a year of scorched earth assault has led to the calculated destruction of Gaza.
*  The human material and environmental costs is unquantifiable.
*  In essence, what you're saying is that as horrible as things were, it is steadily getting
*  worse and worse for the Palestinians.
*  So let's talk a little bit about the trajectory.
*  You were one of the first coming out of official investigators, and of course we should be
*  clear, you're banned from working in the occupied territories by the Israeli government.
*  But I believe you were one of the first to raise the issue of genocide, which is now
*  of course not disputable.
*  But let's talk a little bit about globally the trajectory over the last, and now it's
*  more than a year, what's been happening.
*  Thank you, Chris.
*  Yeah, as it often happens, genocide is not an act, it's a process.
*  It's a very complex crime to identify.
*  But it has a collective dimension, and it builds on.
*  It's made of criminal acts, but what keeps everything together is the intent to destroy
*  through this criminal act a group in whole or in part.
*  And this is what we have seen happening in Gaza as of the beginning of October.
*  I've said it's October 9 where things became undeniably genocidal, where there was a genocidal
*  intent expressed.
*  The word amalek in my view is the most telling of all, because amalek is a biblical term
*  that has been evoked primarily by Netanyahu, but then by others, and by the soldiers who
*  have been acting as willful executioners of that plan that call amalek, which in the Bible
*  is go and destroy the amalek.
*  The mother, the suckling, the donkey, the camel, everything.
*  And this is what has been happening in Gaza.
*  The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction of psychological and physical torture,
*  the devastation, the creation of conditions of life that would not allow the people in
*  Gaza to leave from the destruction of hospitals, the mass forced displacement, and the mass
*  homelessness while people were being bombed daily.
*  And the starvation.
*  How can we read these acts in isolation?
*  We need to take a step back, look at the whole and see what is happening as there is no other
*  reasonable inference that can be drawn, even without looking at the intent as expressed
*  by the use of the word amalek, which is like chop the tall trees in Rwanda.
*  This is the term that has marked this genocide.
*  So Francesca, you make the point that in order to categorize what's happening as genocide,
*  there are innumerable factors, mass killing, extermination or an act of extermination in
*  the internet of itself doesn't necessarily constitute genocide.
*  You write in the report that the destruction of Gaza has raised allegations of what you
*  call domicide, herbicide, scholasticide, metaside, cultural genocide, and ecocide.
*  And then you note nearly 40 million tons of debris, including unexploded ordinance and
*  human remains contaminate the ecosystem.
*  Over 140 waste sites and 340,000 tons of waste, untreated wastewater and sewage overflow
*  contribute to the spread of diseases such as hepatitis A, respiratory infections, diarrhea
*  and skin diseases.
*  As Israeli leaders promised, Gaza has been made unfit for human life.
*  So all of these we're going to talk about in detail.
*  You document what's happening in detail, but just talk about the complete eradication that
*  raises what's happening to the Palestinians to the level of genocide.
*  Absolutely.
*  In fact, what constitutes genocide is a specific number of criminal acts, like I mentioned,
*  acts of killing, killing members of the group when the group is identified as a through
*  four main criteria, ethnical, racial, national or religious.
*  And the group is targeted as such.
*  This is the critical element.
*  And then there are, as I was saying, acts of killing, infliction of severe bodily or
*  mental harm, the creation of conditions of life that will lead to the destruction of the group.
*  And then there are other two crimes that I'm not saying are not present or have not occurred in
*  Gaza, simply have not had the elements to investigate that, although one regrettably saw
*  the prevention of birth.
*  I do think that this is an area that urges ad hoc investigation, because the way Israel has steadily,
*  even before October 2023, targeted children is revealing of an animus or a mindset to target
*  the Palestinians from the very, very early age.
*  And this is demonstrated by the numbers of children arrested and detained, brutalized,
*  tormented, tortured in some instances, although the threshold for torture for children is lower
*  than for adults. And the killings, the extrajudicial killings of children hit in the head and torso.
*  These are elements that have always been there.
*  How come we have not seen it?
*  We have not seen what was happening, the trajectory we were describing before.
*  But again, what is relevant in order to establish that there is genocide is not just the intent behind
*  these crimes enunciated at Article 2 of the Genocide Convention, is the overall intent,
*  the specific intent to destroy the people and the group as a whole or in part as such.
*  And what is the group here?
*  Is the Palestinians as such?
*  The Amalek, the monsters, the human animals.
*  This derogatory language, this dehumanizing language has prepared the spirit of those who have
*  ordered and planned and executed the genocide.
*  And it's not an easy task to establish genocidal intent, although, as I already wrote in my first
*  report, it's impossible to deny it when it's so ostentatious, as in the evidence, it is so
*  ostentatious as in the case of Gaza.
*  But there are three elements that I write about in the report.
*  Even when the direct evidence of intent, like a plan on which Israeli leaders have written,
*  yes, we want to genocide the Palestinians, let this aside.
*  I do believe that there is a direct intent, but let's assume that there is not.
*  When direct intent is unavailable, then intent should be or must be drawn from inference.
*  And only reasonable inference, says the jurisprudence.
*  But we have to consider these elements that while recognizing the possible composite nature
*  of genocide, the fact that one war crime or one crime against humanity might also constitute an
*  act of genocide.
*  And this is pretty obvious.
*  And often genocides have happened in the context of civil strife, like it was in
*  former Yugoslavia.
*  But even the genocide of the Jewish people and Roman Sinti in a way happened in the context
*  of the war.
*  However, the compartmentalization of conduct into desperate acts without capturing the broader
*  context is extremely dangerous.
*  It's nonsensical.
*  You cannot look for the genocidal intent with a magnifier.
*  You need to take a step back and look at the overall totality of the conduct, all the acts,
*  the scale and nature of them, the knowledge of what these acts would have resulted into.
*  In the totality of the territory against the totality of the people.
*  And again, doing otherwise, and we can elaborate on that, but doing otherwise would
*  verify the clear obligation in the genocide convention to prevent genocide when the intent
*  manifests itself.
*  When the word amaleck was used, that was already a sign.
*  It was not captured.
*  But then on the 26th of January, the International Court of Justice identified the plausibility
*  of risk for the rights protected under the genocide convention for the Palestinian people,
*  the plausibility that acts of genocide were being committed.
*  So why Israel was not stopped then?
*  And then as of then, the acts have continued, have multiplied.
*  And you know what, please?
*  I ended the...
*  My report only covers facts until September 2024.
*  But just in the last three, four weeks, the crimes that have been committed against the
*  Palestinians, the burning people alive, the bombing camps, refugee camps and schools
*  and UNWA premises, this is...
*  And going home by home in northern Gaza, while the population is continuously exposed to
*  the threat of starvation, what can it be?
*  What can it be?
*  So again, Israel continues to commit acts of genocide in Gaza, and the risk of this
*  metastizing to other parts of the occupied Palestinian territory is very real.
*  Well, you make that point, and you spend time talking about the conditions in the West Bank,
*  which are of course becoming worse and worse.
*  I was in the West Bank in July.
*  You raised a very important point that none of it is new.
*  What's new is the scale.
*  So in 2000, the cartoonist Joe Sacco, who wrote Palestine and footnotes in Gaza, and
*  I did, I took my vacation time to do it from the New York Times, went to Hanayunis and
*  wrote what we called a Gaza Diary for Harper's Magazine, and just wrote day by day what life
*  was like.
*  The settlers were still there at Netsarim.
*  And while we were in the camp, I speak Arabic, I heard through the loudspeakers,
*  which means come, come.
*  As the kids, the young boys, 10, 11, 12, were coming out of school on their way home from
*  school.
*  And then they began, the Israelis began through the loudspeakers on their jeeps using
*  curse words, Ibn Sharbuta and these horrible terms, the kids naturally picked up rocks
*  and they shot them.
*  They were like mice enticed into a trap.
*  That article, and we had their names, the times they were shot, I mean, it was
*  incontrovertible, led to my being told by the newspaper that I would no longer cover
*  the Middle East.
*  I would no longer be allowed to report out of the Middle East.
*  So what we're talking about is scale, and I think you capture that in the intent has
*  always been there, but the scale is unlike anything we have seen.
*  I think you even argue greater than the Nakba.
*  That's the first point I wanted to make.
*  The second point, when you talk about dehumanization and Amalek, that's what I saw in Bosnia,
*  where the Serbs referred to all the Bosniaks as Ustasa.
*  And to be fair, a lot of the Bosniaks referred to the Serbs as Chetniks.
*  These are World War II terms when the Ustasa were allied with the Nazis and the Chetniks
*  were Serbian nationalists who were fighting the Ustasa separate from Tito's partisans.
*  So I want to ask you about that because essentially these historical terms are used, and of course
*  the Israelis have referred to, as is also in your report, referred to the Palestinians
*  as Nazis, but they historicize this.
*  And I just want to ask you about that.
*  That was true in Bosnia, and that's true in the apartheid state of Israel.
*  Yeah, look, just for the sake of clarity regarding intent, I'm sorry to be the picky lawyer,
*  but what I do say that has always been there is the potential to commit the genocide,
*  because the greater Israel plan that has always been there, making the whole land of Palestine,
*  a land for the Jewish people only, had an eliminatory component for the Palestinians.
*  Because as I write in the report, and I think this will resonate very strongly with all
*  Indigenous people, for the Indigenous people, the land is not the place where they live,
*  it's who they are, it's part of the identity.
*  And this continuous uprooting of the Palestinians en masse in big events in 1947, 49, 1967,
*  and now as of 2023, these are instances where Israel seizes the opportunity to forcibly
*  displace the Palestinians using very destructive means, but never the violence has been so acute,
*  and in a way intentionally deliberately eliminatory as in this case.
*  So it's like the genocidal intent has been dormant in the veins of the system,
*  but then the opportunity, the capacity, the circumstances that developed after October 7
*  have been such to prompt this genocide. And while there have been these massive
*  instances of forced displacement, which is forced displacement is not per se genocide,
*  but again, it might be part of a genocidal conduct, Palestinians have been uprooted
*  all the time, even individuals after individuals, family after family, and Israel has tried to take
*  as much land as possible, inch by inch, home by home, dunum by dunum. And again, this is why in
*  the report I described that in this case genocide is a means to an end. The end is the realization
*  of greater Israel being openly talk about removing the Palestinians from Palestine.
*  They can go to Jordan, they can go to Egypt, there are over 20 Muslim countries. This is so racist.
*  How can we have even entertain such an argument without really stopping it and blaming those who
*  use it, accusing those who use it of racism. But so, yeah, it has always been there and things have
*  escalated at the time Israel found that, yeah, they were ready, but then they did it this way.
*  Yeah, I think it's been quite deliberate, certainly in Netanyahu's mindset and the way they have
*  presented and projected the Palestinians throughout the whole history of Israel.
*  Nureed Pellet, whom I often quote, talks of the, quote unquote, the Nazification of the Palestinians.
*  So yes, there is this dehistoricization of the Holocaust. The Palestinians are blamed for the
*  Holocaust. They are called Nazis. But also look at the language that Israeli leaders, military,
*  political and religious leaders, have used after October 7. We are fighting for the civilization,
*  for Western civilization against the barbarians. We are the light. We are the people of light.
*  These are the people of darkness. This language is non-new. This has been used over and over
*  in other central colonial contexts and genocide in order to justify the crimes, the counterinsurgency,
*  the counterterrorism or the self-defense against these monsters. So this is the reality, how I see it.
*  You write that
*  jurisprudence had broadly focused on determining intent through what you call acts of targeting
*  the very foundation of the group, including the imposition of living conditions leading to
*  what you call slow death and the destruction of the spirit, of the will to live and of life itself.
*  In other words, intent to destroy is assessed holistically and in totality.
*  I want to ask about journalists. It's not in your report, although I know you have spoken out about
*  Israel's attack on journalists and they just condemned, I think it's six reporters for Al Jazeera,
*  Palestinian reporters for Al Jazeera, who are some of the last. The Committee to Protect Journalists
*  is talking about 128 killings of journalists in Lebanon, West Bank and Israel. I think the Palestinian
*  figures are higher, 177. It's unlike I was a work correspondent, unlike anything I saw in El Salvador.
*  I think we lost 22 journalists or Sarajevo was again a few dozen. This assault on journalism is
*  unprecedented. Just before we go on, I know you've spoken about it. I want you to,
*  because as you said, by condemning these Al Jazeera reporters as members of Hamas,
*  you've essentially delivered them a death sentence.
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. You see, there is this concept that everyone
*  labeled or qualified as a terrorist by Israel deserves to die. But this is so dehumanizing
*  not only because again, it builds on a racist presumption of guilt on the side of Palestinians.
*  The Palestinians are so naturally terrorists that it almost goes unquestioned when Israel says,
*  these are Hamas affiliates or terrorists themselves. But also where is the presumption
*  of innocence? Where is the principle that everyone, including alleged criminals, alleged
*  perpetrators are entitled to justice? You see, all this has been eroded, erased by Israel, which has
*  transformed, I often say, the world in a world without civilians. It's the light against the
*  dark is good people against evil. And this is how Israel is justifying the mass killing of the
*  Palestinians, the destruction of what remains of Palestine and its people. This is not just
*  the conflict during which most journalists have been killed. This is also the conflict
*  in which the highest number of UN officials have been killed. The highest number of UN premises
*  have been targeted. The highest number of hospitals have been targeted. All universities
*  have been destroyed and never a population has gone starving so fast. Never such a high number
*  of people have starved at such a speed. This has been concluded by the special rapporteur on the
*  right to food. And the commission of inquiry in June of this year said never a population or
*  never a number of people of this proportion has been displaced at such a speed before.
*  Sorry, no, sorry. I need to rephrase. This is not what they say. They say that this has been one
*  of the fastest forced displacement of history. The people from northern Gaza into southern Gaza,
*  both the north and south, were being bombed in the early months of the genocide last year.
*  And the media, you know, it's interesting. I was re-reading
*  Camus recently and I found this quote which is very telling. It says that
*  the journalists are the historian of the incident. And as such, they should look at the facts,
*  report on the facts. Of course, they can analyze their own interpretation,
*  but they need to report on the facts in their nudity as they appear. And this has not been done.
*  And it's not uncommon that in the context of a genocide, the media contribute to play a critical
*  and criminal role. This has been asserted by international tribunals in the case of former
*  Yugoslavia, in the case of Rwanda. But what is unique here is that this is not just the Israeli
*  media who have amplified the genocidal statement, genocidal calls, which have provided a platform
*  to rapists, to go Israeli soldiers who had raped Palestinians to go and show and rant about
*  their right to rape Palestinians. It's not just that. And there have been critical voices among
*  Israeli journalists. In 972 does an incredible work. Haaretz as well has very good journalists
*  and they are honest about what's happening in the West. The mainstream media has replicated
*  and amplified the lies we have heard. And sometimes if I look at politicians and journalists
*  who have repeated lies, the story of the beheaded babies, the Israeli babies from October 7 is not
*  true. Does it take away the kinds that Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have had committed
*  against Israeli civilians, killing or brutalizing or taking them hostage? Of course not. But what's
*  the need to talk about mass rapes? There is no evidence of rape, which doesn't mean that rape
*  didn't occur, but there is no evidence. So why people, Western leaders, talked of these videos,
*  of these pictures. President Biden said that he had seen the picture of the beheaded babies.
*  And what did he see? I'm not saying they didn't see that he invented it. But again, where is the
*  evidence and why are later there are countries like my own country in Italy where they are
*  continuing to relaunch these lies? Why so? Why has Western media been so complicit
*  with the genocidal mindset? Why it has covered up and why it has further dehumanized the Palestinians?
*  And here I think we are finally put in our, really as naked creators in front of
*  a mirror as a society. This is who we are. Extremely racist toward the Palestinians.
*  This is not something unique to the Palestinians. I think that people in the global South are
*  generally perceived as less worthy by some people in the West. It fits the racialized stereotype
*  which is not challenged by the dominant society. So I want to ask before we get into the specifics
*  in your report, you write perpetrators of genocide almost always allege their actions were taken
*  pursuant to an ongoing military conflict. Yet genocide may be a means for achieving military
*  objectives just as readily as military conflict may be a means for instigating a genocidal plan.
*  And then you write genocidal intent may exist simultaneously with other
*  ulterior motives. One of the mantras certainly within the US press, the US media landscape
*  is Israel's right to defend itself, Israel's right to defend itself as if that precludes
*  the possibility of genocide. And you make that distinction in your report that it doesn't.
*  So there are three layers that need to be understood here. The first is that even when
*  a state has the right to defend itself from an attack or a serious threat of an attack,
*  it cannot commit genocide. And the fact that the court, the International Court of Justice,
*  the Supreme Organ of the United Nations had already identified this possibility,
*  should have put Israel on notice, did put Israel on notice and should have been an alarm for the
*  entire international community, which should have not acted business as usual as of then.
*  And instead this has not happened. But also I say in the report, people tend to confuse
*  the motives with intent. Intent is the determination is when an individual or here,
*  in the report I'm talking of state responsibility because this is critical and I would be very happy
*  to unpack that later. But it's the determination to destroy a group in whole or in part. And
*  the mastermind behind it might have different motives. Might want to do that to stay in power.
*  Might want to do that because this is seen as a way to liberate the hostages or might want to do
*  that because they feel entitled to eradicate a political entity or its armed wing. But motives
*  are irrelevant in international criminal law. In the case of genocide, we need to look at
*  the intent, what eventually has manifested like mens rea, like the mind that want to
*  destroy. This is why we need to be very, very clear because I hear people saying,
*  no, but Israel doesn't want to commit genocide. They want to liberate the hostages as if it was
*  another intent that could be inferred. No, no, it's not. First of all, as you know from the
*  report, as you have read it, I debunk both the argument that it was even a motive,
*  the liberation of the hostages. This is a mantra or a refrain that has helped Israel continue to
*  fund the flames of attack against Gaza. So I debunk that and I debunk the argument of eradicating
*  Hamas. But let's spend the word on self-defense because as you rightly point out, and it's shocking
*  for me to see that the member states continue to talk about the right of self-defense as if it
*  was an existential, as if Israel was facing an existential threat that legitimated its
*  wholesome war against another people. There is no self-defense that Israel can invoke against the
*  people it maintains under occupation because look, the only context in which a state can invoke
*  self-defense is when it's attacked or by another state or the use of hostages authorized by the
*  Security Council. There is no Security Council resolution authorizing Israel to wage a war,
*  but why so? Because Israel cannot wage a war against the population it maintains under occupation
*  because this population has the right to resist an unlawful occupation. Now, when I say that,
*  I infuriate many because they say, oh, you see she's justifying violence. No, I'm just saying
*  what international law says because again, states have the right to defend themselves and so have
*  the people, especially people whose right of self-determination has not yet materialized
*  and therefore there would be a conflict within international law itself if self-defense took
*  precedence over the right of self-determination. Israel, the only way for Israel to protect itself,
*  which is its sacrosanct right, is to withdraw from what remains of historical Palestine,
*  withdraw the occupation, withdraw the settlements, withdraw its exploitation of
*  Palestinians resources as it has been ordered by the International Court of Justice in July
*  this year and then stop practicing apartheid against the Palestinians, including those
*  with Israeli citizenship. You talk about one of the tactics being the humiliation and degradation
*  of Palestinians. You write, prisoners stripped and sadistically tortured en masse,
*  bodies of adults and children piled up and decomposing in the street, survivors forced to
*  eat animal food and grass and drink seawater or even sewage, the maiming of thousands, including
*  young children left limbless before they could even crawl, the destruction of homes
*  and violation of intimate life, having absolutely nothing to return to, mass graves and the exhumation
*  and relocation of bodies are specific, desecrating acts which themselves can suggest
*  genocidal intent. Combine these acts go far beyond what international jurisprudence recognize
*  as steps in the process of destruction of the group and then you add the pain and loss will impact
*  generations to come. Yes, absolutely.
*  I mean that issue of trauma and it's just sustained trauma. When I covered Sarajevo, we lasted
*  as functional journalists about three weeks and then we had to get out and recover before we came
*  back in. The Palestinians can't get out. I can't even begin to imagine and especially the effects
*  on children what week after week, month after month this is doing. I mean it's almost inconceivable
*  in terms of the trauma that they're enduring.
*  Yeah, but look, I mean I don't mind to say that this genocide has affected everyone who was
*  looking at it from near and far. Of course nothing can compare to the Palestinians who have
*  experienced it firsthand, the survivors or the Palestinians who have watched it
*  broadcast from afar, the Palestinians in exile. Because I think it's a very effective image that
*  of a people as a body. You chop a limb in a body, the entire body suffers and so for a people
*  who has been really victimized for 75 years and for whom the Nakba, the catastrophe,
*  has never ended. This is not an instance of the past. It has been continuous ongoing.
*  How much they have suffered, it's indescribable because it's true the Palestinians are killed,
*  they're blamed and they're smeared. This poses a question to all of us as societies that have
*  let it happen because Chris, I mean here we cannot play with words. Those who didn't do anything to
*  prevent this from happening were either the monsters who committed it or the monsters who
*  enabled it. And again, there is something, it's again looking at the violence that has been
*  unleashed under our watch against the Palestinians. I don't think that we can, again I often refer to
*  this as an atrocity, but also the bureaucrats who have justified it. What have we become
*  as a society? What have we become watching the killing, the butchering of 17,000 children?
*  Again, I think something inside me broke at some point this year. I've become, I thought,
*  I've become desensitized, but I'm not clearly. I mean as I hear you reading parts of the reports,
*  I think, oh my God, yeah, tears come to my eyes and I'm the one who wrote that report.
*  We have forced the Palestinians to, we have abandoned the Palestinians in an inferno that was
*  a tragedy foretold. And yeah, Palestinians will bear the scars, will carry the scars,
*  will carry the scars of this and will carry the shame. This should have not happened, especially,
*  especially because of what the West is, how it has affirmed itself internationally for its soft
*  power and its credo in human rights and an international law-based order. We have lost
*  our credibility, but we shouldn't have let it happen, especially because we failed to prevent
*  and the genocide in Rwanda, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and more than anything else.
*  We are the ones who have perpetrated genocides against colonial people and even against our own
*  people because the Jewish people who were killed, were exterminated, were genocided
*  during the Holocaust were our people. So again, this shows us that we have not improved at all
*  from where we were 80, 90 years ago. And all the more now we have let it happen with an international
*  legal framework, which was perfectly fine to identify and stop it.
*  Well, I think of all of the Holocaust studies programs, which exist in almost every university,
*  and I watch what's happening in Gaza and my only conclusion is that they've learned nothing.
*  Yeah, I agree with you. But you know, Chris, I realized this this year, there is such a disconnect
*  among people, including my generation. I mean, I grew up, this is why I mean now, it pained me a lot
*  when they started accusing me of antisemitism. It's something so revolting. Antisemitism is
*  revolting. And so being accused of antisemitism makes no sense whatsoever for who I am. But
*  especially because I grew up with this profound immersion in what the Holocaust had been, because
*  this was part of my upbringing from school, but also from my family. I mean, I was I grew up in
*  a family who educated me with basic values. And the thing is that I realized that we have confused
*  the Holocaust or we have reduced the Holocaust to the experience of the concentration camp,
*  but the concentration camps, but in fact, the Holocaust, it was a culmination of it. The
*  genocide was a culmination of a process that had started with the normalization of the humanization
*  of the Jewish people, the fact that they could be kicked out of professions and their homes and every
*  space that they had called life. Simply because of the way they were Jewish. And if we don't
*  understand the racial, the racial element that characterized the racial discrimination, that
*  characterized what we have done to the Jewish people, we cannot understand what is still to be
*  addressed and to be eradicated in our societies, which is racism is still there.
*  Well, also, as Primo Levi pointed out, that the real evil is not external. It's within us.
*  We can all as as levy rights become Haim Romkowski, the Jewish head of the Loitz ghetto who
*  worked in service with the Nazis. I want to get into some of the specifics because
*  you lay it out and it is hard to read. It's just devastating, but I think people need to hear it.
*  Let's begin with
*  Gaza. You write, in recent months, 83% of food aid was prevented from entering Gaza,
*  and the civilian police in Rafa were repeatedly targeted, impairing distribution by repeatedly
*  targeted. Let's be clear, they were shot by the Israelis. At least 34 deaths from malnutrition
*  were recorded by 14 September 2024. At the time of writing, Prime Minister Netanyahu was evaluating
*  a plan to block all food supplies to northern Gaza, which of course has come to fruition,
*  proposed by advisor Giora Eland, who previously endorsed introducing epidemics as a military
*  tactic. The killing of civilian police and Klan leadership providing security for food
*  distribution further compounded the crisis in Gaza. This is a targeted destruction of the remnants
*  of any kind of civil administration.
*  Yes, in the last months we have seen and we continue to see the destruction of any remnants
*  of life in Gaza, with the possibility to continue to live, to have life in Gaza. Again, I think
*  that what I tried to do in the report, because I have a very limited in terms of word count,
*  so I could only write 10,000 words, so I had to provide a bird's eye picture.
*  I looked at patterns, at the massacres that have been committed, and food is one of the most
*  the most telling stories. You can have various stories, various ways to tell this genocide,
*  but the way food has been destroyed in Gaza, Gaza had, as you know, because they have been there,
*  farmland that was cultivated with love and care by Gaza farmers, and it had boats to fish,
*  despite Israeli restrictions in accessing the sea, this has been destroyed.
*  Bakeries and other areas where food could be produced have been targeted. Humanitarian aid
*  has been denied, and when it has been approved, it has been extremely limited, and even when it
*  entered, it was targeted, so people were meant to be starved. I don't know if you remember this video
*  that was circulated in February by the Israeli army around the time of the Flower Massacre,
*  where Palestinians were gathering to collect bags of flour, and the Israeli army targeted
*  the crowds. There was this video which was circulated that depicted, it was very
*  interesting the way that people portrayed the Palestinians as small black points, they looked
*  like ants, and even I felt like, yik, there is something wrong with it. It was meant to elicit
*  a sort of disgust toward the Palestinians. It's been brutal. Please, it's been brutal. Again,
*  I let the dust settle, and we have the full picture of what Israel has done, and the Israelis will be
*  ashamed forever. I'm sorry. I mean, I'm concerned. I'm very concerned with the Israelis as well,
*  because I do believe that they are victims of some sort, especially, and I don't want to justify,
*  of course, I cannot justify what they have done, but they've been doctrina, particularly,
*  to see the Palestinians as the enemy, the ones who had caused their extermination.
*  This is a fact that the Jewish people are traumatized because they've been persecuted
*  for centuries, and the Holocaust was the culmination of that persecution.
*  So there is something that probably, it's an intergenerational trauma that has changed the
*  way these people function and see the world. So they are prone to see an existential threat outside
*  for them. I don't blame them for this. I blame Israeli governments who, as Nourit Pellet says,
*  contributed to dehumanize the Palestinians through school programs, through media narratives,
*  through the political discourse, and they don't see the Palestinians as human. This is why they
*  can kill women and children and enter in person with no respite.
*  Well, Ilan Pappi wrote a book about that process of indoctrination
*  several years ago. I want to talk about, as you do in the report, the Israeli torture camps. You
*  write, thousands have disappeared, many after being detained in appalling conditions, often bound to
*  beds, blindfolded and in diapers, deprived of medical treatment, subject to unsanitary conditions,
*  starvation, torturous cuffing, severe beatings, electrocution, and sexual assault by both humans
*  and animals. At least 48 detainees have died in custody. And of course, as we speak,
*  thousands, certainly hundreds, if not thousands of Palestinians are being detained
*  and subject to these conditions in northern Gaza, especially in Debalio.
*  Yes, we have seen in the last hours new tracks of Israeli army loaded with half-naked Palestinians,
*  a scene that we had seen already earlier this year, Palestinian men of different ages.
*  You know, this is when it comes to arrest and detention, which is a topic that has been very
*  dear to me as a lawyer, as I was there in Palestine, and it was shocking to me,
*  the easiness that Israelis had to arrest and detain Palestinians, but really for things that
*  were basic instances of life. And this is why when I became a special rapporteur, my second report
*  was about arrest and detention. I've spoken of a mass incarceration governance. So it was already
*  there and it was quite persecutorial toward the Palestinians. So it was
*  arrest and detentions were used in a criminal way, as in a widespread and systematically arbitrary
*  fashion before October. What has happened after October 2023, it's incredibly telling
*  of the destructive intent that Israel has had. Because look, let's assume for a second that Israel
*  had the right to conduct a war in Gaza. And well, there are rules, including wars, and so people
*  cannot be killed if they do not pose an imminent threat. If there is a suspicion of crimes, they
*  have to be investigated and prosecuted for being deprived of their freedom. This doesn't apply to
*  the Palestinians, but let's even admit that Israel had the right to arrest all those who had been
*  arrested in Gaza and have been detained in appalling conditions. But what about the
*  Palestinians in the West Bank? What did they have to do with what happened in Gaza? This is why I
*  say we need to look at the totality of conduct against the totality of the people. Because there
*  was no Hamas military commander in the West Bank fighting the Israelis. Of course there were also
*  armed resistance, but because there is an unlawful protracted occupation, we generate resistance.
*  The thing is that most of the Palestinians were arrested and detained, including children,
*  and put in despicable conditions, much worse than what was already pretty horrific,
*  were from the West Bank. So this is why I say, look, there is no justification.
*  And another thing that struck me is that I started receiving
*  reports from individuals of instances of torture and serious abuses in detention as early as January.
*  And together with other special rapporteurs, I investigated a number of these cases. But what I
*  then as of February and March, reports started to be circulated by Andwa and then
*  Pikati, an Israeli organization, and then Petzalem, which unveiled the system of
*  the torture network that exists in Israel. And then remember one of the lawyers who had
*  interviewed Palestinians who had been released from arrest and detention, told me, I've never
*  seen, I mean, it's very humiliating for a Palestinian. Like in general, there is a cultural
*  element to talk about rape. And this time it was different. They were really desperate to tell
*  what they had endured and denouncing rape as it had been used against them and others.
*  So it has broken the taboo that you cannot talk about rape because it's been used in a widespread
*  and systemic fashion. That was true in Bosnia too, with Srebrenica. I want to talk about the West
*  Bank. You talk about, you call it the risk of genocide in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,
*  the devastation inflicted on Gaza is now mustasticizing to the West Bank, including
*  East Jerusalem. In December 2023, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant predicted that
*  when what the IDF did in Gaza becomes clear, that will be projected on Judea and Samaria. That's the
*  term that, that's a settlers term for the West Bank. Between the 7th of October 2023 and September
*  2024, Israeli forces carried out more than 5,505 raids, violent settlers supported by Israeli
*  forces and officials conducted 1,084 attacks, killing over 692 Palestinians, 10 times the
*  previous 14 years annual average of 69 fatalities and injuring 5,199 people. The pattern
*  of targeting children is shocking. Since the 7th of October, 169 Palestinian children have been
*  killed, nearly 80% of whom were shot in the head or torso. This represents a 250% increase on the
*  previous nine months, totally more than 20% of the children killed in the West Bank since 2000.
*  Echoing the brutality that swept Gaza, Palestinians in the West Bank have been subjected to appalling
*  detention practices following orders by National Security Minister Ben Gavir. A mass arrest campaign
*  led to the detention of tens of thousands with 9,400 currently detained. As in Gaza, many are
*  academics, students, lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders designated as terrorists
*  or national security threats. Leaked videos and interviews with prison officials
*  revealed intentional and systematic abuse and brutality, degradation, torture, and even rape.
*  At least 12 detainees from the West Bank died as a result of torture and denial of medical care.
*  I want to ask about the West Bank because I think it's often overlooked. I was just in Ramallah and
*  visiting my friend the novelist Attaf Abu Saif in July and the day before I got there, the Israelis
*  had come in to Ramallah, which is technically part of the, I think it's now 19% of the West Bank that
*  the Palestinians under Oslo are supposedly allowed to administer without Israeli occupation or
*  interference. And they had come in and burned the money transfer shops, the shops by which Palestinians
*  received money from abroad. And when I left Attaf and I came in through the King of St.
*  Bridge in Jordan, I asked him, you know, for those of us on the outside, what's the most important
*  thing that other than speaking out that we can do materially to help? And he said food and clothing.
*  So I'd like you to speak about the West Bank and what's happening because I think it's
*  often overlooked. And as your report makes very clear, all of the tactics that are familiar in
*  Gaza are being accelerated on the Palestinian population in the occupied West Bank.
*  Absolutely. I think that it's important to bear in mind that while our eyes have been
*  fixated with no result, I mean, nothing has stopped the genocide, but have been fixated on Gaza,
*  the situation in the West Bank has deteriorated dramatically. And it's clear from the facts
*  that I reported that you kindly read. What has happened is that before October 7, what I thought
*  might happen was a total collapse of the possibility of Palestinians to
*  to live in the West Bank and therefore to explode against the occupation. I don't think that the
*  Palestinians had the capacity to initiate another intifada because of the matrix of control, because
*  of the tight level of oppression over them.
*  Let me just interrupt Francesca because for people who don't understand what Israel has done in the
*  West Bank is encircle completely through settlements, closed military zones, special roads,
*  all this kind of... They've encircled Palestinian enclaves, essentially cutting themselves.
*  When you say they can't resist the same way, unlike Gaza, which is contiguous, what they've
*  created in the West Bank are kind of completely surrounded by the sense and they can choke it off.
*  So for me to go from the King Hussein Bridge from Jordan up to Ramallah, it should take an hour.
*  It takes four hours because you can't move. There's constant Israeli checkpoints and those
*  checkpoints, people are terrified because they're flying checkpoints. They're not permanent.
*  They just suddenly appear and then people are hauled from their cars and they disappear and
*  etc. So when you talk about the inability of the Palestinians to build any kind of resistance,
*  I think that's an important point.
*  In my carcerality report on arbitrary arrest and detention, I said the overall
*  occupied Palestinian territory is like a panopticon, a prison controlled from outside and from within.
*  And it has very much the aesthetics and the features of a large prison. It's not just Gaza.
*  So for those who have less experience than us in Palestine, the occupied Palestinian territory
*  is totally fragmented. Yes, there is Gaza, which has been isolated, but it's a contiguous area,
*  like Chris was saying. And then the West Bank is an area fully controlled by the Israelis
*  because even in the areas, the Palestinian Authority has authority only in towns and cities.
*  But even there, the Israelis conduct military operations and raids all the time. And outside
*  of these areas, the Israeli army is ever present and the settlers are the ones who control
*  and who determine the security needs for the settlers and also the army in the areas.
*  There are red lines that Palestinians of course cannot see, cannot know of, but if they are crossed,
*  the settlers will call the army and the army will arrest the Palestinians for simply walking
*  on their land, land that the settlers think is theirs by divine decree. And you know, this land,
*  imagine for the Palestinians, the reason why Chris, you call it Bantus, says that yes,
*  the Palestinians live in these pockets of land that are separated from each other, from areas,
*  the land controlled directly by settlers and soldiers for hundreds of kilometers of segregated
*  roads, meaning roads that the Palestinians cannot even get into. And on the roads that they can use,
*  there are 500, more than 500 fixed checkpoints and then hundreds of flying checkpoints.
*  And then there is digital surveillance and gates, again, the aesthetic of the prison. And then there
*  is also another part of control. The Israelis cannot do anything from building a house,
*  going to a university, traveling... I mean the Palestinians, the Palestinians cannot.
*  You said the Israelis cannot, the Palestinians. Oh, oh, thank you, thank you. And you know,
*  on top of this, there is another layer of oppression and physical and
*  and mental restriction. Because the Palestinians cannot do anything without the army's
*  authorization. They cannot build a home, they cannot get married, they cannot have a wedding
*  or organize a vigil, they cannot open a business, they cannot travel abroad, they cannot change
*  residence without the army's authorization. And the army doesn't give permits. For example,
*  think that of all the building permits that Palestinians apply for, 1% is authorized.
*  The rest is denied, which means that the Palestinians often build, for example, without
*  permits. And this leads to demolition. Israel has demolished until October 2023, 60,000 civilian
*  infrastructures outside the situation of conflict. Meaning it doesn't account for the homes destroyed
*  in Gaza in 2008, 2012, 2014, 2021, 2023. There have been five major wars against Gaza before October 7.
*  So the situation was devastating. And the US bank, it was close to to explode because
*  since this new government coalition came on board, they have advanced the annexation of
*  what remains of Palestinian land and annexation meaning acquiring, claiming title over the land
*  that is not lost through the use of force, which is prohibited. So it doesn't, Israel,
*  with this coalition government has advanced annexation of Palestinian land,
*  host displacement of the Palestinians, further repression of Palestinians. 460 Palestinians had
*  been killed in the 16 months prior to October 7. I have been a special offer for those. 460 Palestinians
*  and 60 Israelis. This is why the situation was untenable. And in the West Bank, the West Bank is
*  the settler colonial frontier. It's where the-
*  700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
*  Correct. 700. And this is something that your audience needs to think about. The reason why
*  there is so much insecurity and so much violence in the occupied Palestinian territory and for the
*  Palestinians. If I had to point to one element, it's the colonies. Israel has built 300 colonies,
*  300 settlements, which are illegal under international law. They constitute a war crime
*  in and of itself. And now they are home to 300,000 settlers, Jewish Israelis who live
*  in occupied land. So they are part of a criminal endeavor. And therefore, you know, the situation
*  was already worth investigation and prosecution by the International Criminal Court and others
*  before October 7. But Israel has benefited and profited from an impunity that has intoxicated
*  it. It intoxicated its officials and unfortunately intoxicated its society, convincing them that they
*  could really treat the Palestinians as disposable. I want to close by talking about, which is in your
*  report, the signs of permanent annexation by Israel in both Gaza and the West Bank. But in
*  particularly in Gaza, you write, according to satellite imagery and other sources,
*  Israeli soldiers have built roads and military bases in over 26% of Gaza, suggesting the aim of
*  a permanent presence. The Israeli military expanded the buffer zone along the Gaza perimeter to 16%
*  of the territory, flattening homes, apartment blocks, and agricultural farms by August 2024.
*  Repeated evacuation orders over approximately 84% of Gaza had corralled the majority of the population
*  into a shrinking, unsafe humanitarian zone covering 12.6% of a territory now reconfigured
*  in preparation for annexation. In early September, two Israeli ministers openly called for conquest
*  and annexation of significant areas of Gaza. I mean, we're seeing it as we speak in northern Gaza,
*  the effort to drive the last 400,000 Palestinians in northern Gaza out through starvation and brutal
*  attacks on densely populated areas. But you raise in the report the signs that they are already
*  beginning a process of annexation, in which Palestinians will not return.
*  Yeah, this is what's happening. But you know, as I was writing the last, I was adding the final
*  touches to the report. I wrote about the plan that you evoked, Elad's plan to reconquest
*  Gaza. This is not new. I mean, since the very beginning, soldiers have been on record saying,
*  we are here to destroy this place and occupy and resettle. So the idea that Gaza was theirs and had
*  to be sort of the object of a reconquest has had a phenomenal impact on the mindset of the Israelis.
*  The point is that Gaza is home or was home to 2.3 million Palestinians and they have nowhere else
*  to go. Actually, 75% of them are not even from Gaza. This is why I hit the roof when I hear people
*  talk about Gaza. Because they are not from Gaza. 75% of them are refugees from modern-day Israel
*  and have their family properties mostly in the area of South Israel, Be'er Sheva and
*  the Kibbutz who have been attacked. Now, I don't think that there is any, this is the story of that
*  place. So the idea that this can be resolved by kicking out the Palestinians from what remains
*  of Palestine is brutal. But also, again, it comes to mind that who, how do you say in Italian,
*  who seeds the, who seeds the wind, harvests the storm. And this is what Israel is doing.
*  That's taken from the Bible. Seeds the wind, reaps the world wind.
*  I want to close by asking, it's a legal point you make towards the end of your report.
*  The ongoing genocide is doubtlessly the consequence of the exceptional status
*  and protracted impunity that has been afforded to Israel. Israel has systematically and flagrantly
*  violated international law, including UN Security Council resolutions, international
*  court of justice orders. This has emboldened Israel's hubris and defiance of international law.
*  As the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has warned, if we do not demonstrate our
*  willingness to apply the law equally, if it is seen as applied selectively, we will be creating
*  the conditions of its complete collapse. This is the true risk we face at this perilous moment.
*  Talk about that. Yeah, I think we are really in that
*  unchartered territory. The system, the system that has been built after the Second World War
*  has been put on a test in Gaza. And it has miserably failed from my humanitarian, political,
*  and legal point of view, because nothing has been enough. Nothing has been sufficient to prevent
*  and stop acts of genocide. And even as we speak, these acts continue. But it seems to me,
*  and these are news of the past days, that the sense of impunity and Israel's hubris is not
*  limited to Israel. I mean, the United States has threatened to defund the United Nations if
*  it takes, the General Assembly takes steps against Israel, because there is a final discussion about
*  suspending Israel's from its membership, the General Assembly. But again, not because there
*  are no other states committing violations of international law, but hey, here, first of all,
*  we have a history of a state committing, persevering in violating international law
*  through and through, which leads to, led me to describe Israel as a persistent
*  violator of international law. Therefore, it is to be treated as South Africa was treated at the
*  time of apartheid, but also Israel is committed violations, including preventing the realization
*  of the right of sub-determination of the Palestinian people, which is the right to exist as a people.
*  You see the trajectory of the genocide, as I say, this has been the dormant gene of the
*  colonial project that Israel has enforced in Palestine, bringing it to its most extreme
*  consequences. Therefore, I do believe that the international community is living in a phase of
*  schizophrenia, or probably we are already past that point, part of the international community
*  has accepted that the system can be sacrificed, that the system which was conceived and devised
*  to protect us all, and it has protected us all, particularly in the West, not the rest,
*  but us in the global North have benefited from it. And we will miss human rights very much when
*  and the United Nations system were very much multilateralism very much when they will not
*  be there anymore. And now the unchartered territory I was talking about is that
*  we don't know what's going to be next. We have failed the Palestinians, but we have also failed
*  the humanity that has mobilized to stop the genocide in Gaza. We have seen a critical
*  shock in Western democracies that have turned more aggressive toward their own citizens,
*  toward those protesting against the genocide, whose fundamental freedoms, like freedom of
*  expression and freedom of association have been curtailed. So you see, I think that there is much
*  more in this moment that we are risking than the already unbearable, unbearable price that the
*  Palestinians are paying. And this is something that should worry all of us, that should make
*  all of us, including those who are completely indifferent to the fate of the Palestinians or
*  the Israelis, and should move them into sacrificing a little bit of their comfort
*  and taking action so that an entire people doesn't have to sacrifice everything they have.
*  Thank you. That was UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albenesi on her latest report on the
*  occupied territories. I want to thank Diego, Max, Sophia, and Thomas who produced the show.
