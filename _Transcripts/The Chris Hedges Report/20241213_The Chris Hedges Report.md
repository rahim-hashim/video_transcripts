# Enduring the Trauma of Genocide (w Gabor Maté)  The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnDSaS9b_lY)
*  There are numerous layers of trauma arising from the genocide in Gaza.
*  Of course, the worst trauma is being inflicted on the Palestinians in Gaza, traumatized long
*  before the genocide began, but thrust into a relentless nightmare that week after week,
*  month after month, sees them reduced to dire poverty and deprivation amid carnage and mass
*  slaughter.
*  But what of us who watch this live-streamed genocide?
*  What is this doing not only to the rule of law but to our own psyches?
*  How are we being changed as genocide becomes normalized not only by Israel but its chief
*  arms supplier, the United States?
*  What of the Israeli soldiers who commit these atrocities?
*  And how will this trauma play itself out in the future?
*  Dr. Gabor Amate in his book, The Myth of Normal Trauma, Illness, and Healing in a Toxic Culture,
*  which he wrote with his son Daniel, argues that our culture's standards of normalcy are
*  in fact destructive to the physical and psychological health of human beings.
*  In a distorted society, one that feeds on perpetuating trauma, one where profit and
*  personal attainment are the highest values, one where everyday people are left to endure
*  their pain and shame and silence, one where Palestinians are dehumanized and indiscriminately
*  murdered.
*  How are we to nurture our emotional and psychological health?
*  How are we to avoid heading down the path of individual and collective annihilation?
*  Trauma, Dr. Amate illustrates, plays out not only on our bodies but in the kinds of relationships
*  in the world we create.
*  Joining me to discuss these issues is Dr. Gabor Amate, a physician and childhood development
*  specialist who has written several bestselling books, including In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts,
*  Close Encounters with Addiction, When the Body Says No, Exploring the Stress, Disease
*  Connection and Scattered Minds, The Origins and Healing of Attention Deficit Disorder.
*  Gabor, let's begin by talking about what trauma does to us and then I want you to address
*  what sustained or repeated trauma does to us because the Palestinians have no capacity
*  in Gaza, there's no capacity for them to recover.
*  It's just, it's now over a year of endless trauma.
*  Well, first of all, Chris, thanks for having me.
*  Nice to see you again.
*  Well let's start with the Palestinians.
*  Where there was a study 20 years ago now looking at Palestinian children and something like
*  95% of them 20 years ago showed some symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.
*  A large percentage, lest anybody think that history started on October the 7th, a large
*  percentage of kids wet their beds, they were hostile towards their parents, they had nightmares,
*  anxiety, depression and so on.
*  This was 20 years ago.
*  And when you think of the young militants who streamed into Israel on October the 7th,
*  guess who those kids were?
*  Guess who those young people were?
*  And of course that's been going on for decades upon decades upon decades.
*  There was a study that just came out a few days ago that showed that war trauma actually
*  affects the genetic functioning of kids, that it actually affects how their physiology functions
*  long time later.
*  So we can just imagine what's happening there now and what's going to be the impact in the
*  long term.
*  It's almost unfathomable, especially since the support services that ordinarily would
*  embrace these kids and give them some kind of succor and some ease and some support to
*  the parents, all that's been destroyed.
*  The adults that are meant to keep them safe and to protect them are completely incapable
*  of doing so.
*  It's unimaginable.
*  And it's been going on for well over a year now.
*  This is upon decades upon decades of trauma such as you yourself witnessed when you were
*  corresponded there.
*  So from that point of view, it's hard even to predict.
*  Here in the West, of course, it depends on how plugged in or keyed in we are to the situation.
*  A lot of people deal with it because they're being sensitized and inured.
*  They don't even care.
*  If you get a conversation on an American TV network debating on which quarterback is the
*  best in the national football here right now, you're going to get millions of views.
*  But when you get discussions of what's happening in the world to real human beings, relatively
*  speaking, not that many people are interested.
*  So one of the things that this culture does is it actually desensitizes people.
*  It inures people.
*  From the point of view of people that care, and of course there's many millions who do
*  care, a number of things happen.
*  I'll tell you what happened to me after October 7th.
*  It triggered all my childhood trauma.
*  I really went into a state.
*  I was reactive, irritable, despondent, and that took me a couple of months to climb out
*  of.
*  It just took me over.
*  It was like my mind and heart were occupied territory because I'm so aware of what's
*  going on there.
*  As a former Zionist, I don't need to know anything more than what Zionism has done to
*  these Palestinians.
*  And I've been watching this for decades.
*  And then to see this horror, I didn't know what to do with it.
*  I've come out of that.
*  But it took me some time.
*  A lot of people have been similarly affected in their emotions and their hearts are broken.
*  There's a sense of helplessness that despite all the news that we get and despite all the
*  evidence in front of our eyes, we feel so helpless.
*  We feel so inert in the face of what's going on.
*  There's something called moral injury.
*  Moral injury is when you watch something terrible happen, you feel helpless in the
*  face of it.
*  And that's, I'm sure, has affected a lot of people.
*  And then, and on the part of activists, I've seen this.
*  I mean, there's been some beautiful activism and people have really extended themselves.
*  But the persecution of people who have been active has been relentless and has been merciless.
*  So people lose their jobs.
*  I know doctors who've lost their positions because they've spoken out.
*  Academics are under threat.
*  The student movement, of course, they've done it.
*  They've tried to crush it with so many ways.
*  So people have paid a heavy price.
*  And I think above all, and I don't know how you feel about this, but you've been very
*  you've been speaking about this issue for a long time.
*  You've been there.
*  You witnessed it.
*  You reported on it.
*  You've paid a price within your own profession for your truth speaking about this.
*  You and I have both spoken on this issue extensively, but none of that has saved the life of a
*  single Palestinian child.
*  Where does that leave us?
*  It's hard to hold all that outrage and that despair, that desire and commitment to do
*  something and the short term ineffectiveness of anything that we do.
*  These are difficult states to negotiate.
*  Well, despair is the right word.
*  And like you, the first few months, although it's not great now, of course, came to me
*  at night, having spent so much time in Gaza, but also having spent time in Sarajevo, because
*  I know what it feels like to be shelled continuously 24 hours a day was a bad combination.
*  Although the saturation bombing of Gaza does not compare to Sarajevo.
*  Sarajevo was no fun.
*  Three to four hundred shells a day, constant sniper fire.
*  But that's nothing compared to Gaza.
*  They've dropped the equivalent of two nuclear weapons in terms of explosive powers on Gaza
*  in an area 20 miles wide and five miles wide.
*  I want to talk about the differentiation of trauma.
*  Trauma you endured as an infant or a small child during the Holocaust.
*  You, I believe, separated from your parents.
*  Your grandparents perished in Auschwitz.
*  And the trauma that I experienced as a war correspondent.
*  But I, it must be different to be at this point somebody who has lived for over a year.
*  I mean, there's no clean water.
*  There's no housing.
*  The stench of the rotting bodies, of course, thousands.
*  I mean, some people are estimating that it's 200,000 dead.
*  We don't know.
*  I certainly know Palestinians who I was in contact with a few months ago.
*  We no longer have any contact.
*  They're not listed as dead.
*  They're just, they've just disappeared.
*  Talk, differentiate for us that kind of trauma that you endured or maybe I endured and the
*  trauma that is now being visited on the Palestinians on Gaza over this length of time.
*  I mean, I would have a hard time drawing a corollary.
*  I mean, maybe Sarajevo, maybe the Warsaw Ghetto, but it must manifest itself in different ways.
*  Well, not being there and not being in direct contact and not dealing with the situation
*  doesn't leave me in a position to say anything definitive.
*  But again, I can only extrapolate and imagine, you know, so I can tell you something.
*  I'm 80 years old now.
*  I'm sitting here in my room, working on the computer or reading a book.
*  My wife walks into a room, into the room where I am and I don't hear her and all of a sudden
*  I go like this.
*  Now this is the startle reflex of a three month old.
*  And if you take a three month old baby and you slap your hand, make a loud noise,
*  they're going to, you know, it's still, it's still ingrained in my nervous system.
*  Because apart from the genocide that was happening around us and threatened to engulf my family,
*  as you say, it did take my grandparents, there was a war going on.
*  And I was in Budapest and the ally is an infant and the allies were bombing Budapest.
*  So that these loud noises and the air raid sirens
*  And it was nothing like what's happening in Gaza.
*  Nothing compared to it.
*  In terms of the numbers of people dead, at least we stayed in the same apartment.
*  The Gazans are having to move all the time.
*  They set up tents, the tents are burnt down.
*  There's a deliberate destruction of the civilian population.
*  Healthcare workers are targeted by drones.
*  Food workers are targeted by drones.
*  So I can't think of a single situation that's comparable.
*  And you and I both witnessed the Vietnam War,
*  there was a lot of carpet bombing, deliberate destruction,
*  assaults on civilians, napalming of children.
*  But at least those people had the capacity to fight back.
*  So there was a sense of possibility and ultimately victory.
*  These people are like utter helpless, exposed victims
*  of a military force that they have no capacity to resist in any meaningful sense.
*  I don't know what the sense of hopelessness and this constant bombardment
*  and this insecurity and starvation.
*  I mean I can only extrapolate to say that
*  unless of course there's one saving grace here,
*  you and I both witnessed it, the incredible resilience of the Palestinians,
*  their spirit, their communal sense.
*  I find myself rambling when I try to answer your question
*  only because I can't find the words for it.
*  I think it's beyond words this one Chris, this is beyond words.
*  And I know that I think it was you that interviewed one of the founders of Hamas
*  who watched his uncle being killed in a civilian massacre in 1956.
*  And you can see what happened to those people, you know.
*  What will happen to these kids?
*  And the orphans, when a Palestinian kid is orphaned,
*  it's not like they lose their father and their mother,
*  they lose their uncles and grandmothers and grandfathers, whole families.
*  This weekend 40 members of a single family were killed.
*  So when that child is orphaned, it means that the whole support system is gone.
*  So you know what?
*  I can't tell you.
*  I can only extrapolate from what I've seen and imagine something unfathomable.
*  When we began the discussion, this was Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi,
*  by the way, one of the co-founders of Hamas who I knew,
*  who was assassinated in 2004 with his son by the Israelis.
*  And he was in Hanunis in 1956.
*  He was a 10-year-old boy.
*  And he watched the Israelis line up hundreds of people against the wall,
*  including his uncle, and execute them.
*  And that set him on a life of armed, militant resistance against the Zionists.
*  I used to argue with him about suicide bombings.
*  This was when suicide bombings were happening in Jerusalem and other places,
*  which I covered.
*  I was there when the horrific bombings would take place
*  and watch the bodies being laid out on the sidewalk.
*  And he would always answer me with statistics,
*  which seemed to me a way to morally evade the subject.
*  And he would say, well, they've killed more of our children than we've killed.
*  And when they stop killing, our children will stop killing their children.
*  He was a very bright, he was a doctor, graduated first in his class
*  from the University of Alexandria.
*  I mean, he was extremely intelligent and well-spoken.
*  I just want to ask you about that.
*  I mean, he seemed, and I pressed him on that point more than once,
*  he seemed incapable of grappling with the moral dimensions of suicide bombing,
*  which I found frustrating.
*  And my argument to him was that he was surrendering the essential,
*  the moral superiority of the Palestinian cause
*  by engaging in indiscriminate killing of civilians.
*  And you brought up October 7th and linked it to trauma.
*  But can you talk a little bit about that violent response?
*  We have to acknowledge that on October 7th,
*  there were atrocities that were clearly committed
*  by armed Palestinian factions,
*  not systematic rape, not beheading of babies,
*  this was all Hasbara, Israeli propaganda,
*  but there were real atrocities.
*  Talk about or link for me the trauma these people have endured
*  and the atrocities that take place.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, a couple of things come to mind.
*  One is there was a very famous leader of the Warsaw ghetto uprising.
*  I wish the name escapes me.
*  Mark was his first name, but he was a cardiologist.
*  You're talking about Mark Edelman.
*  Mark, yeah.
*  That's right.
*  Just as Gabor, his wife was one of the founders of Med Sand du Monde
*  and lived, she was also in the ghetto
*  and she lived with me in my apartment in Salvador
*  when she worked in Salvador.
*  Isn't that something?
*  So Mark Edelman was the second in command
*  and became the first in command of the Warsaw ghetto uprising.
*  And needless to say, nobody talks about him in Israel
*  because he was a supporter of Palestinian freedom.
*  But he would criticize the Palestinian resistance
*  for their bombings, the suicide bombings
*  and their attacks on civilians.
*  So he could make a distinction between the justness of their cause
*  and the inhumanity of some of their methods.
*  And the other doctor that comes into mind
*  is a Palestinian psychiatrist.
*  I think maybe his surname was Siraj, but I'm not sure.
*  He was a famous psychiatrist in Gaza
*  who talked about these children
*  who watched their parents being incapable of protecting them
*  and their parents being humiliated by the Israeli soldiers
*  which the Israeli army is...
*  I mean, they just humiliate parents in front of their kids
*  and the helplessness of their parents
*  so that these kids then gravitate towards a movement
*  that says, we're going to fight back.
*  So you can understand the appeal to these kids
*  whose parents are powerless to support a force
*  that at least says, we're going to fight back no matter what.
*  So that's, on a human level, it doesn't justify anything
*  but it's totally understandable, number one.
*  Number two, I think the man you mentioned,
*  something happens in their heart.
*  Their hearts get shut down.
*  I think what happens is that one of the impacts of trauma
*  is it can close your heart.
*  And when your heart is closed,
*  you don't see the humanity of the other.
*  And this has happened in a big way in Israel now.
*  I mean, yeah, the Palestinian resistance
*  has engaged in some unjustifiable actions
*  including some of what happened on October 7th.
*  Mind you, as both you and I know,
*  the real history of October 7th has yet to be told
*  and all the details have yet to be uncovered.
*  But no matter how we look at it,
*  there are some horrible things that were done
*  by the Palestinians on October 7th
*  because they were full of hate,
*  because they were so traumatized.
*  But if you look at the history of the Palestinian resistance
*  but if you look at the Washington Post yesterday
*  had an article showing the videos shared by Israeli soldiers.
*  And you've seen some of this,
*  the viciousness, the vindictiveness,
*  the hatred, the inhumanity.
*  And these are people who had not been traumatized
*  in the same way as the Palestinians had been.
*  And they're quite capable of celebrating,
*  you know, the event in Amsterdam a few weeks ago.
*  What the Western press did not report
*  is one of these soccer hooligans from the Maccabee
*  football team, soccer team
*  who have been notoriously racist forever
*  the night before the so-called pogrom.
*  What they were chanting,
*  you know what they were chanting in Amsterdam?
*  There are no schools in Palestine
*  because we've killed all the kids.
*  And they were chanting this with glee.
*  So not justifying anything,
*  but if the Israelis who haven't suffered anything
*  compared to what the Palestinians have suffered,
*  in fact they've perpetrated it,
*  if Tehattu can be so embittered and closed and shut,
*  can we understand why some of the Palestinians
*  might have responded the same way?
*  I'm not favoring it, I'm not justifying it.
*  I'm saying as the doctor you were talking to
*  who could not get your love back
*  and the doctor you were talking to
*  who could not get your logic
*  on the inhumanity of suicide bombings,
*  his heart was closed.
*  And that's a trauma response.
*  Yeah, what did Dostoevsky say?
*  Hell is the inability to love.
*  In war I would meet people
*  who had become completely numb through trauma.
*  But I found, you know, having spent years in war zones
*  and being around them,
*  they didn't live very long.
*  That complete shutting, emotional shutting down
*  led them to carry out acts
*  that either were intentionally or unintentionally suicidal.
*  They began to engage in all sorts of activities
*  and this was also true with war correspondents
*  who spent too long in war zones.
*  They would usually drink themselves to death or they would.
*  But it becomes, I'm gonna ask you
*  because you know far more about it than I do,
*  but what I saw anecdotally
*  is it became a route to self-annihilation.
*  Well, when you look at, when you talk to Israelis,
*  a lot of the soldiers come out of these adventures
*  with post-traumatic stress disorder.
*  And not just because of what happened to their comrades
*  but because of what they themselves perpetrated
*  or witnessed.
*  And the results are self-destructive.
*  And from that point of view,
*  that society in perpetrating what it's doing now
*  is also destroying itself.
*  But that's in the long term.
*  In the short term, they're gonna impose a lot more suffering
*  and a lot more devastation on the completely captive population.
*  But yeah, it's self-destructive.
*  And again, like these correspondents that you talk about,
*  it's probably to some degree a question
*  of that moral injury that I mentioned.
*  Where they're watching this stuff,
*  they're reporting on it,
*  but they're totally helpless in the face of it.
*  And what does that do to a human being
*  of watching something as horrible as all this
*  and being totally inert or inept or incapable
*  of stopping any of it?
*  And I think the only way to get through this
*  is to allow ourselves to feel our despair,
*  to allow ourselves to feel our...
*  Like, generally we try to run away from what you're describing,
*  people drinking themselves to death.
*  Why are they doing that?
*  Well, you know, what do you say about somebody who's drunk too much?
*  There's an old expression,
*  oh, he's feeling no pain.
*  So that alcoholism is an attempt to run away from pain.
*  All addictions are an attempt to run away from pain.
*  And the only way to get through this
*  is to allow ourselves to feel the pain,
*  to feel the despair, to feel the outrage,
*  to feel the heartbrokenness,
*  not to run away from it.
*  And we have to accept that this is how it is right now.
*  Not...
*  And that word acceptance can be misunderstood
*  as meaning that we accept the situation,
*  that we don't do anything about it.
*  I don't mean that.
*  But I mean we have to accept what is
*  and the limitations of our capacity to change it.
*  You know, I...
*  I strolled out of a Passover, family Passover dinner
*  nine months ago, so screaming at everybody.
*  This is a holiday that's supposed to celebrate freedom
*  and escape from slavery,
*  meanwhile, this is going on in Gaza.
*  You know, well, that was a traumatic response on my part.
*  You know, because I had difficulty just being with
*  that this is how it is.
*  So can we be accepting of our own emotions,
*  our despair, our outrage, our daily heartache,
*  and not be overwhelmed by it
*  and still remain active in the face of it,
*  but not be filled with bitterness and hatred at the same time?
*  Because I'm telling you,
*  I've felt so much bitterness over the last year.
*  And hatred.
*  And...
*  I kept it under reasonable control.
*  I'm talking about my internal experience.
*  I'm talking about my internal experience.
*  And the people, good people, that don't get it,
*  that don't want to get it,
*  that don't want to look at what's actually going on,
*  a lot of families have broken up over this.
*  So...
*  How can we be with this horror and survive as human beings
*  in our fullness of our humanity?
*  Can we stay loving and compassionate
*  and rational at the same time?
*  It's very difficult.
*  Which is, I think, why a lot of people
*  just distance themselves from it.
*  I want to ask about how people reconcile
*  the atrocities that they committed
*  having been in war and around atrocities.
*  I had to report about them.
*  I myself was shut down.
*  I was clinical, became overly clinical.
*  I didn't, even though I was standing over bodies
*  often that had been mutilated and killed, of course,
*  I would have my notebook and I would count numbers
*  and describe the particular ways
*  their eyes have been gouged out
*  or their throats have been slit or whatever.
*  But not in the moment, I wouldn't feel anything.
*  But sometimes then, maybe sometimes weeks later,
*  it would hit me like a tsunami.
*  And I wondered about the Israeli soldiers
*  coming back from Gaza,
*  and at least from your experience,
*  I'm assuming that in Gaza,
*  they also, as I was, were shut down.
*  And yet if they don't engage in this self-destructive
*  behavior, it does come back.
*  There is a reckoning.
*  Again, I don't presume to know,
*  you know, even a fraction of what you know.
*  But I wondered if you could address that point.
*  Well, there are some Israeli soldiers
*  and I'm sure you've talked to them
*  who have an epiphany at some point
*  of understanding of what they've done
*  or what their comrades have done
*  of what they witnessed.
*  And then they have a difficult reckoning
*  and then they become active
*  to try and stop it from happening again.
*  That's a small minority of the Israeli population.
*  The same thing, of course, happened in Vietnam
*  to a number of American soldiers.
*  The difference was that in American society
*  there was a fair bit of support
*  or soldiers who came to rule
*  and oppose what their armies were doing
*  because there was a significant anti-war movement.
*  In Israel, they come back to a society
*  that for the most part ignores what they did.
*  As we know from all kinds of Israeli reports,
*  they don't get to see what they're doing in Gaza.
*  And the soldiers who come back, come back as heroes.
*  And they are lionized
*  and they are supported in their unconsciousness.
*  And in order to reckon with what they've done
*  or what they've witnessed,
*  they have to actually go against their whole society.
*  Soldiers coming back from Vietnam
*  who were willing to talk about it,
*  who were open about it,
*  the veterans against the war,
*  they were embraced by a lot of people.
*  In Israel, they face ostracization,
*  the small minority.
*  It's going to be much more difficult for them.
*  Now, it's going to have a terrible impact
*  on Israeli society in the long term.
*  It's going to further entrench
*  the traumatizing nature of that culture.
*  But it's going to take a long time.
*  That's as best as I can foresee it.
*  And all the more so since
*  Israel is like an addict
*  where the uncle is supporting them
*  with giving them heroin,
*  giving them all the heroin they want.
*  And Israel is getting all that support
*  from the Western world
*  and from Canada and the U.S.
*  and all the former colonial countries
*  that justify it, that valorize it,
*  that support it.
*  So there's not the context
*  for them to come to their senses.
*  Now, I know Israelis.
*  I counseled an Israeli woman
*  who lives in Europe,
*  I won't say where, an academic,
*  a few days ago,
*  because she's full of guilt for being an Israeli.
*  She's so ashamed of herself
*  just for being an Israeli.
*  So my work with her was
*  to help her understand that
*  she's got nothing to be ashamed of.
*  You know.
*  But those are very few.
*  I know some.
*  There are very few.
*  I know in Canada,
*  I know Israelis who have given up
*  their Israeli citizenship out of disgust,
*  out of sheer disgust
*  over what it means to be an Israeli these days.
*  But that's a small minority.
*  So for these soldiers coming back,
*  I think this whole society
*  that still supports their madness
*  and valorizes their cruelty.
*  So it'll be harder for them to come to terms with it.
*  The reckoning will come,
*  but it's much harder for them.
*  Does it come?
*  I mean, so I, Robert J. Lifton's book,
*  The Nazi Doctors,
*  where he interviews doctors who worked in the SS.
*  And I can't remember if it's Lifton's term
*  or it might be Svetlana Todorov,
*  but he talks about moral fragmentation
*  and they take relatively trivial activities.
*  You know, they're good to their wife
*  or they go to church or something.
*  And they use these trivial,
*  you know, or marginal activities
*  because of course they're engaged in a project of evil
*  to define themselves
*  and then are able psychologically
*  to ignore the vast evil that they perpetrated.
*  Can one survive like that?
*  Is that an effective coping mechanism
*  to deny responsibility?
*  Well, as you and I know,
*  Henry Kissinger died at the age of, was he a hundred?
*  He died in bed, lauded and adulated by most of society.
*  So yeah, it's possible.
*  And how many millions of deaths was he responsible for?
*  You know?
*  Can I stop for a second and get something for myself?
*  I want to read you something.
*  Yes.
*  This is Heinrich Himmler,
*  the head of the SS,
*  responsible for the concentration camps
*  in a note to his wife, Margaret.
*  I'm off to Auschwitz.
*  Kisses, your Hiney.
*  There's a can of caviar.
*  And this is, oh sorry, this is Himmler.
*  I'm off to Auschwitz.
*  Kisses, your Hiney.
*  I'm off to Auschwitz.
*  Kisses, your Hiney.
*  To his wife, Margaret.
*  His wife writes to him,
*  there's a can of caviar in the icebox.
*  Take it, take it.
*  Yes, it's possible that people are so fragmented
*  that they can actually live with themselves.
*  In fact, that fragmentation is necessary
*  for them to live with themselves.
*  Did you see the film,
*  The Zone of Interest, about Auschwitz?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  Whose Jewish director was
*  so heavily criticized in Hollywood
*  because he dared to mention the Palestinians.
*  Well, it's about Rudolph Hess,
*  who was the commander of Auschwitz,
*  whose family home was right outside the gates.
*  And he had a dog that he was nice to,
*  he had children that he cared about,
*  and then he'd go in every day and perpetrate these murders.
*  But you know what's interesting?
*  Is that
*  he was captured after the war
*  and sent to
*  Poland to be tried.
*  And the Poles tried him for murder,
*  and of course, mass murder and war crimes,
*  and
*  sentenced him to death.
*  And a few weeks before he died,
*  he wrote a letter to his son
*  saying,
*  whatever you do,
*  let your heart be the guide,
*  listen to your heart,
*  don't let your mind decide,
*  and don't accept what authority tells you,
*  question everything.
*  Let your humanity shine.
*  I'm paraphrasing him.
*  But you know what?
*  He meant it.
*  He had a real transformation.
*  And he wasn't looking for clemency,
*  he wasn't going to get any.
*  He just came to terms with his conscience.
*  And he says,
*  the reason I was able to do this, he says,
*  is because the Poles showed me compassion
*  like nobody in my whole life had ever showed me compassion.
*  Despite what I'd done, they showed me compassion,
*  which put me in touch with my God again.
*  So he's somebody who,
*  a few days before he died,
*  overcame his fragmentation.
*  And there were a few Nazis like that,
*  a minority.
*  Many of them never came to that point
*  and they went to their deaths
*  convinced that they were victims of injustice
*  or defiant.
*  So I want to ask,
*  I want,
*  I'm just saying,
*  that wholeness is possible,
*  but it's not guaranteed.
*  And yeah, it's possible for people.
*  Now,
*  the reckoning,
*  I wish I believed in future lives
*  like some Buddhists do or Hindus do, you know.
*  Then I could at least tell myself,
*  these guys will pay for it
*  next time, but I don't,
*  my mind doesn't go there.
*  I have no idea what the consciousness of a Kissinger was.
*  I don't know, I have no idea what it's like to be inside his head.
*  I have no idea what it's like to be inside
*  the head of a murderer like that.
*  But I also don't want to find out,
*  you know.
*  I want to draw a distinction between
*  Himmler and Kissinger
*  because they didn't actually carry out the killing.
*  In fact, when,
*  the one time that Himmler had to witness
*  the mass murder of Jews
*  of I and Isaac Grubineth,
*  I believe threw up, he was sick.
*  And I think that's the only time
*  I believe threw up, he was sick.
*  And then the actual people who they direct,
*  of course they're ultimately responsible,
*  but I think there probably is a difference
*  for people who actually carry out
*  their orders, carry out their murders.
*  There are consequences that they feel,
*  although they are tools of these power systems,
*  that those who direct them do not feel.
*  Well,
*  I think that's probably true.
*  And
*  when you look at who actually perpetrates the murders,
*  they're usually the
*  the lowest,
*  the least educated
*  and the most unconscious people.
*  If you look at Lieutenant Calley, for example,
*  who's the one person who was actually punished for a meal I,
*  where hundreds of people were massacred,
*  women, children, elderly.
*  Who was he?
*  And if you look at the people that perpetrated Abu Ghraib,
*  usually looking at very low level,
*  poorly educated, very traumatized people.
*  And they're the ones who are thrust into these positions.
*  And my guess is, not my guess,
*  my very educated opinion on this one is
*  that the people who perpetrate those things directly
*  are actually themselves who were already traumatized
*  even before they did these things.
*  It's their disconnection and their fragmentation
*  that even allowed them to behave that way in the first place.
*  There was
*  there was an interesting documentary in Hungary
*  under the communist regime.
*  There was a concentration camp called Reczk,
*  that's the name of the place,
*  where they took
*  the enemies of the system
*  to be tormented, sometimes killed,
*  certainly mistreated,
*  often tortured.
*  And
*  the guards
*  that served the communist system
*  had actually been the same ones
*  that belonged to the Crossed Arrows Nazi party
*  during the war.
*  Low level,
*  poor class, traumatized people.
*  And the communist system took these same people
*  and made them protectors of the
*  people's republic.
*  And the documentary showed the prisoners
*  and then the guards decades later.
*  Obviously this film was made
*  much later.
*  The emotional health
*  and demeanor of the former prisoners
*  was so much more salutary
*  and composed
*  and grounded
*  whereas these guards were just
*  broken.
*  You can tell by their facial expressions
*  how tormented they were.
*  Even though
*  it was the prisoners who suffered the torture
*  and the guard who perpetrated it,
*  it's the latter who in old age
*  were totally broken.
*  I want to ask about Christopher Browning's book
*  ordinary men reserve police battalion 101.
*  These were middle-aged men
*  not members of the Nazi party recruited
*  to carry out mass executions of Jews.
*  The commander,
*  I think the colonel of the unit actually
*  said that those who did not want to carry out
*  these mass executions
*  would not be punished.
*  A handful of people refused.
*  Most of them, of course,
*  through heavy drinking.
*  But were they traumatized?
*  Or were they just not morally sentient?
*  Well, why would somebody become morally insentient?
*  You know?
*  I mean, we're born a certain way,
*  you know, and
*  human morality,
*  if you look at the actual studies,
*  develops not because people teach you morality,
*  not because people
*  indoctrinate you in good ways of being,
*  but because they treat you well,
*  because they see you
*  as a person
*  and they love you as well,
*  because they see you,
*  they understand you,
*  they love you,
*  they embrace you,
*  they promote the development
*  of the moral faculties,
*  which is a natural human process
*  given the right conditions.
*  So, the lack of moral sentience
*  is actually a sign of trauma.
*  This means that these people
*  were hurt very early,
*  very early.
*  So that they shut down
*  and that shut down from feeling that
*  what we're really talking about here
*  is an escape from vulnerability.
*  Now, vulnerability
*  from the Latin world who are Naurari to wound.
*  So, our vulnerability
*  is our capacity to be wounded,
*  which we have from moment of conception
*  until we die.
*  But the mind can handle only so much vulnerability
*  and only if there's protection
*  so that we escape
*  not from true vulnerability
*  but from our capacity
*  to feel and acknowledge our vulnerability,
*  we escape from it
*  when the initial conditions are so painful
*  and so hurtful.
*  So that flight from vulnerability
*  that results in moral lack of sentience
*  is itself a trauma response.
*  And if you look at the mass murderers,
*  you know, the mass killers
*  who are in jails,
*  it doesn't matter who you look at,
*  they were all severely traumatized
*  as children
*  and according to all the research.
*  So, we're not going to get into that here.
*  Well, when Thessawate writes
*  his two-volume set male fantasies,
*  he talks about the coldness,
*  the severity,
*  use of corporal punishment
*  within traditional German society
*  is, I think, to buttress your point,
*  as essentially a kind of breeding ground
*  for people who will,
*  who through childhood trauma
*  will carry out atrocity.
*  Oh, and when you look at the actual lives
*  of the Nazi leaders,
*  they were all very traumatized children
*  from Himmler to Hitler to Göring,
*  you know,
*  and their hearts had completely shut down.
*  They completely shut down.
*  So, lack of moral sense
*  is itself
*  a trauma response.
*  I've experienced my heart being cold sometimes.
*  I know what that feels like.
*  I don't like it.
*  And it's a trauma response.
*  And it takes some work to
*  and some awareness
*  and some support to move out of it.
*  I think most people,
*  if they're honest with themselves,
*  you know, there's a
*  Holocaust survivor,
*  Edith Egger, her name is,
*  she's in her 90s now,
*  a wonderful woman.
*  She was probably on the same train
*  that my grandparents were on
*  on the way to Auschwitz.
*  Her family was in Auschwitz
*  and her family died there.
*  My grandparents did.
*  They lived in the same city
*  in southern Slovakia.
*  She survived and she wrote a book called The Choice.
*  And she says in that book
*  that we all have a Nazi in us.
*  So that capacity for closing down
*  and being cold-hearted,
*  that's certainly in me,
*  probably in you,
*  I don't know if you personally want to know.
*  Of course.
*  It's in all of us.
*  And I think that's what circumstances
*  help us melt that heart
*  and what circumstances
*  freeze it even more.
*  Well, Primo Levi makes,
*  I think, the same point.
*  Absolutely.
*  And that's why Primo Levi
*  is such a great writer on the Holocaust
*  is because he,
*  he's not a moralizer.
*  He just describes the way it was.
*  And by the way,
*  he was also a supporter of
*  Palestinian freedom.
*  Which again,
*  he was never forgiven.
*  He writes about Haim Romkowski
*  in the Lodz ghetto,
*  ran the ghetto,
*  the Jewish figure
*  and talked about how we all have
*  Haim Romkowski within us.
*  That's right.
*  But of course, it's that knowledge,
*  you know, when you externalize evil
*  the way many Zionists do
*  towards Palestinians,
*  you, in the name of cleansing evil,
*  it's when we recognize the evil within us,
*  that's the most important
*  element to
*  preventing ourselves from
*  committing evil because we know it's there.
*  I want to talk a little bit about,
*  you know,
*  this has been a very hard year
*  for all of us who
*  care about,
*  you know,
*  human existence
*  and the rule of law
*  and the oppression of the oppressed.
*  What just a close would you tell people
*  is the most important thing
*  to sustain our own
*  mental health,
*  our own equilibrium
*  and yet of course not be silenced.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the first thing is
*  find others,
*  don't be alone with it
*  because it's
*  difficult to suffer and to witness
*  all this
*  without
*  sharing it with people
*  that understand you
*  and can support you.
*  So I think we need
*  I think we need to be
*  in community about this,
*  whatever community you can find.
*  Number one, number two,
*  don't get consumed by it,
*  don't let it take over your life,
*  not in the sense of don't be active,
*  but
*  take care of yourself.
*  Because for two reasons,
*  one is if you don't take care of yourself,
*  whatever that means and I can talk about that,
*  but if you don't take care of yourself
*  you'll burn out.
*  People talk about compassion,
*  fatigue, people talk about burnout.
*  What that is is
*  not taking care of ourselves,
*  so we burn out and then you're no good to anybody.
*  The second reason is
*  if you don't take care of your own mental health
*  then the quality
*  and impact of your activity
*  is going to be impaired.
*  So I've spoken many times on this issue
*  over the years.
*  Certainly when I come from a place of rage
*  or come from a place of
*  bitterness,
*  my speaking is not that effective.
*  So
*  you have to come from much of a place of groundedness
*  and some understanding of even the people,
*  especially of the people that are on the other side,
*  you know, which understanding doesn't mean
*  condoning or supporting or agreeing with
*  or putting up with,
*  but it does mean you get where they're coming from.
*  If you want to speak to people
*  and have any hope of getting through,
*  you've got to speak in a way that
*  doesn't immediately threaten them.
*  And I don't mean that in any way to
*  censor your words or to suppress your truth.
*  I'm talking about the tone
*  and how you talk to them,
*  you know.
*  So both for practical and for self-care reasons,
*  you've got to take care of yourself.
*  Thirdly,
*  you and I are rather fortunate.
*  They can't fire us.
*  You know?
*  They just immobilize us.
*  You know?
*  They just demonetize me.
*  That's all right.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You know,
*  if I was still a practical,
*  if I was still a practical,
*  not practical, practicing physician,
*  which I'm not, I'm retired,
*  I know they'd be coming after me.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they do, you know?
*  But to the extent of your,
*  anybody's capacities and platform,
*  use it.
*  Don't stay inactive,
*  because the inactivity itself is demoralizing.
*  So join with others.
*  Take care of your emotional health,
*  whether that takes counseling sometimes,
*  if it takes yoga, meditation,
*  walks in nature,
*  physically taking care of your body,
*  how you eat,
*  journaling,
*  listening to music,
*  whatever inspires or feeds your soul,
*  and
*  and then be as active
*  as you can be
*  within the limitations of your,
*  or the relative limitations
*  or relative possibilities of your situation.
*  And don't take it on personally.
*  You know,
*  there was a rabbi who lived 100 years before Jesus,
*  he said, he's talking about the world,
*  the task of what they call in Hebrew,
*  tikkun alam, you know,
*  healing the world,
*  and he said,
*  the task is not yours to finish.
*  Neither are you free not to take part in it,
*  but it's not yours to finish.
*  You know what?
*  People have been trying to stop suffering,
*  end cruelty,
*  promote healing, promote peace.
*  I mean, you're a theologian, you know?
*  You know all these great avatars of spiritual truth,
*  you know,
*  I often talk about the spectacular failures in history.
*  Take the Buddha,
*  how is universal love going?
*  You know,
*  how is forgiving your brothers and your enemies
*  and turning the other cheek,
*  how is that going?
*  You know, Lao Tzu or the Hebrew prophets and their,
*  and their Christ for justice,
*  you know,
*  how's it going?
*  So you might say they're failures,
*  are they?
*  Or did they not contribute massively to a human project
*  that is a long-term project?
*  In our own little ways,
*  we can each do the same thing.
*  It's not ours to finish,
*  so we can't take it personally.
*  Great.
*  Thank you.
*  That was Dr. Gabo Ormate.
*  I want to thank Diego, Thomas, Sophia,
*  and Max who produced the show.
