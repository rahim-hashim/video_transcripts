# The Dark Money Game (w/ Alex Gibney) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4)
*  The United States, with the 2010 Supreme Court ruling Citizens United, which bizarrely defines [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=0.0s)]
*  unlimited dark money pumped into political campaigns as a form of free speech, legalized [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=16.36s)]
*  bribery. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Alex Gibney, in his new documentary, The Dark Money Game, examines how billions of untraceable [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=23.4s)]
*  dollars outside groups have spent more than $4.4 billion in federal elections, almost [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=30.4s)]
*  one billion of which was dark money, have been pumped into the political system and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=36.28s)]
*  the courts to protect the predatory activities of corporations and block health care reform, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=40.56s)]
*  gun control, and environmental controls to confront the climate crisis. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=47.8s)]
*  The infusion of dark money has not only given tremendous power to the billionaire class, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=53.12s)]
*  but eviscerated our democracy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  The films, inspired by Jane Mayer's book Dark Money, The Hidden History of the Billionaires [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=60.94s)]
*  Behind the Rise of the Radical Right, focus in the first film, Ohio Confidential, on a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=67.08s)]
*  bribery scandal in the tens of millions of dollars in the state of Ohio. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=72.64s)]
*  The second film, Wealth of the Wicked, looks at the corruption of the courts, especially [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=77.84s)]
*  the Supreme Court, which passes laws demanded by the wealthy and corporations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=82.74s)]
*  The result is the authoritarianism of Donald Trump, who promises mendaciously to drain [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=88.78s)]
*  the swamp, and a crony capitalism that mirrors that of Vladimir Putin's Russia, Viktor Orban's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=94.46s)]
*  Hungary, and Narenda Modi's India. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=101.22s)]
*  The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, once tasked with enforcing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=104.82s)]
*  the law, now refuse to enforce the rulings of a handful of judges seeking to roll back [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  the tide of despotism. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=116.54s)]
*  The films lay out how we got here, from the 1971 Lewis Powell memo, the blueprint for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=118.54s)]
*  our corporate coup d'état, to the rise of the Federalist Society and the unholy alliance [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  between the billionaire class and the Christian right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=130.1s)]
*  Joining me to discuss the dark money game is Alex Gibney. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=133.9s)]
*  They're great films, both of them, and as I said before going on the other, the second [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=138.46s)]
*  one, even though I had written a book on the Christian right, there was stuff in there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  that I didn't understand that you got. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=146.46s)]
*  The system was corrupt already before 2010. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=150.18s)]
*  The Clintons had basically sold out the Democratic Party to corporate interests. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=153.86s)]
*  But what you're chronicling is something completely new, and that is untraceable money. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=159.58s)]
*  One of the things I found fascinating about the first of the two films is the labyrinth [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=166.46s)]
*  by which money, dark money, is transferred to candidates to do the bidding, in this case [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=172.88s)]
*  a nuclear power company, First Energy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  But even the FBI with all of their tools has tremendous difficulty in finding the source. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  Let's just define for us what the 2010 ruling did, because Roberts actually from the film [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=189.06s)]
*  I think overstepped what the actual ruling was supposed to enforce, and then lay out [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=195.74s)]
*  how you define dark money and how it works, especially with these PACs. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=203.18s)]
*  Well, the Citizens United decision basically made it possible for corporations and unions, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  I put unions in quotes because they are so much less powerful than the corporations, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=221.9s)]
*  to pour unlimited amounts of money into the campaign process under the guise of free speech. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=226.66s)]
*  Now there was one check or balance in this ruling, which was you're supposed to only [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=235.38s)]
*  be able to give it to independent organizations like super PACs that could have it, and so [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=241.78s)]
*  long as they didn't coordinate directly with the candidate, which is a kind of a joke really, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=250.3s)]
*  but so long as they didn't coordinate directly with the candidate, in theory it would not [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=256.5s)]
*  lead to corruption. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=260.1s)]
*  That floodgate opening has really changed everything, because now the amounts of money [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=264.66s)]
*  are so vast that 90%, I believe it's 90% of elections are won by the candidate who spends [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=268.86s)]
*  the most money. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=278.74s)]
*  So it means that money rules. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=279.9s)]
*  Now the dark part of it is interesting, because originally the idea was, or the rationalization [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  was that if you put money in the super PAC, you can see where it comes from. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=289.82s)]
*  So sunlight, you can see that General Motors has poured blah blah, however many hundreds [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=293.14s)]
*  of millions of dollars into a super PAC. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=300.34s)]
*  But what the dark money groups learned, and particularly people who didn't want to take [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  the political flak for trying to say, ending environmental controls, or big pharma didn't [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=309.3s)]
*  want to take the flak for trying to boost pharmaceutical prices, is that you could donate [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=314.66s)]
*  money to a 501C4, which is a not-for-profit organization whose donors can't be penetrated [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  by public inquiry. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=328.3s)]
*  So you donate to a 501C4, the 501C4 gives to the super PAC, and lo and behold, you don't [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=329.92s)]
*  know where the money's coming from. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=335.98s)]
*  And these were, I mean, you have a point in the film where you have like all these threads [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=339.66s)]
*  from all these boxes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=343.46s)]
*  We're not talking about one 501C4, we're talking, it's a kind of house of mirrors. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=345.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=351.22s)]
*  That's the job. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=352.22s)]
*  I mean, it's not unlike what the Sinaloa Cartel does, which is what one of the prosecutors [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=353.22s)]
*  in Ohio told us. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=357.82s)]
*  You know, the whole job is to hide the money, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=359.18s)]
*  And so you can have a 501C4, which gives to another 501C4, which gives to a super PAC, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=362.7s)]
*  which then gives to a 501C4, a whole bunch of interlocking entities, not to mention, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=369.06s)]
*  you create these corporations who have one function, which then own another corporation, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=374.5s)]
*  which has another function. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=379.74s)]
*  So it's a labyrinth of mirrors in terms of hiding the source of the money. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=381.18s)]
*  Well, your interview, and I believe an FBI agent in the film, and they talk about how [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=386.66s)]
*  that they really found out, we'll talk about the corruption case in Ohio, over $60 million [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  of corrupt money. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=397.3s)]
*  But they said there's so much out there and they stumbled onto what happened in Ohio by [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=399.68s)]
*  accident. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=403.38s)]
*  And that, you know, there's vast amounts of money floating around out there that they [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=406.22s)]
*  can't even see. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=411.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=413.02s)]
*  In Ohio, the corruption case was successfully prosecuted. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=414.18s)]
*  The Speaker of the House, Larry Householder, who was at the center of the ring, did go [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  to jail, as did another gentleman who was involved in the conspiracy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=423.29999999999995s)]
*  But that's extremely rare. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's extremely rare because the Supreme Court has made it very difficult to prosecute [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=429.62s)]
*  these kind of crimes. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=434.5s)]
*  And also because of the dark money, it's very hard to see where the money's coming from [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=435.7s)]
*  to know whether or how you should prosecute. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=440.14s)]
*  In this case, the federal agents had gotten a permission to wiretap somebody as a result, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=443.48s)]
*  you know, to inquire into a gambling, potential gambling crime. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=455.12s)]
*  While those wiretaps were active, they heard the voice of a man named Neil Clark, who was [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=461.6s)]
*  a lobbyist in Ohio. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=465.88s)]
*  And he started bragging about this kind of quid pro quo that they were running with First [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=468.56s)]
*  Energy, this energy company. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=473.68s)]
*  And so the agents stumbled into a much, much bigger case, which they were then able to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=475.6s)]
*  follow the trail of, initially mostly through wiretaps and bodywires from, you know, agents. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=480.72s)]
*  So let's explain how it works. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=490.52s)]
*  You do make a point in the film, both you and Jane, of saying this is hardly restricted [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  to the Republican Party. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=498.52s)]
*  I live in New Jersey. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=499.8s)]
*  George Norcross, the political boss, is now on trial for much a very similar situation [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=502.12s)]
*  to Ohio. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=507.68s)]
*  Let's explain how it works. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=508.68s)]
*  So there was what first energy was a nuclear power facility. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=509.68s)]
*  They wanted a state bailout. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=516.6s)]
*  I love the names. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=518.16s)]
*  It's all out of Orwell. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=519.16s)]
*  What was it called? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=520.24s)]
*  The Clean Energy for Ohio bill or something. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=521.24s)]
*  But explain how it worked, how the system, which you do a tremendous job of showing in [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=524.52s)]
*  the film, but explain how it works. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=530.48s)]
*  The quid pro quo, the pay for play. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  And also the ruthlessness of it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=535.9599999999999s)]
*  These people are ruthless if you challenge them, as Norcross is. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=538.56s)]
*  Well, and one of the great things about the wiretaps is you can hear what people say in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=544.4s)]
*  private and how ruthless they are. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=549.4s)]
*  Which is in the film. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=551.12s)]
*  How willing they are to go after people. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=552.12s)]
*  So for a filmmaker, that was the benefit of this. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=554.48s)]
*  Anyway, here's the way it worked. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=557.64s)]
*  First Energy was a failing power company. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=559.48s)]
*  In fact, it had fallen into bankruptcy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=563.4s)]
*  They were in terrible shape. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=566.48s)]
*  What they did was they dropped $60 million into a dark money slush fund, a 501C4 slush [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=568.48s)]
*  fund, which was... [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=574.88s)]
*  Alex, I have to interrupt you because isn't it one of the FBI agents, somebody says, they [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=577.12s)]
*  said, oh, it must be a mistake. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=583.52s)]
*  It must be $6 million. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=585.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=586.08s)]
*  One of the reporters, one of the great... [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=587.08s)]
*  It was a reporter, right, right. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=589.84s)]
*  ... reporters in Ohio, Laura Bischoff. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=590.84s)]
*  When she first heard $60 million, she thought, well, that can't be right. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=594.04s)]
*  Nobody would spend... [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=598.2s)]
*  But she thought they had gotten, yeah, a decimal point wrong. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=600.0s)]
*  But no, it was $60 million. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=603.12s)]
*  They had dropped into this 501C4, which was to be used at the direction of a guy named [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=605.16s)]
*  Larry Householder, who was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=614.24s)]
*  He initially used the money to fund a brass knuckles campaign to become Speaker of the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  House. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  In so doing, of course, he got a lot of people who owed him big time. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=625.72s)]
*  He insisted they pay him back by ramming through a bill called HB6, which had been [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=630.44s)]
*  written prior to the $60 million changing hands by the First Energy Corporation. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=638.0s)]
*  Lo and behold, that bill gave First Energy $1.3 billion. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  If you're looking at it from a return of investment standpoint, it's pretty good. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  You drop $60 million into a slush fund, you get that $1.3 billion off the backs of the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=653.8000000000001s)]
*  taxpayers of Ohio. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=660.24s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=663.52s)]
*  But then in addition, some of the brass knuckles tactics are revealed. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=664.52s)]
*  They passed this bill. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=669.5s)]
*  And by the way, a lot of that bill is still in effect, even though the two people who [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=670.5s)]
*  put it there were put in prison for their corrupt activities. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=676.8s)]
*  Then there was a citizens group who was so appalled by this bill that they started a [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=682.1600000000001s)]
*  signature collection campaign because in Ohio, with a referendum, you can overturn bills [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=692.2s)]
*  that have been passed through the legislature. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=698.32s)]
*  So they did, but then the householder had all this money to spend and he began to start [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=700.88s)]
*  muscling the signature collectors. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=708.32s)]
*  And he began buying up signature collection companies and asking them to stand down. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=712.92s)]
*  And then for other signature collectors, he would literally pay them to leave the state [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=717.72s)]
*  so that they wouldn't be collecting signatures. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=722.36s)]
*  And representatives who objected, he literally threatened them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=726.8s)]
*  So they're using these brass knuckles tactics in order to get people to stand down and they're [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=730.84s)]
*  using it with the money that they'd gotten from First Energy. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=735.04s)]
*  So it's pretty interesting. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=739.48s)]
*  And one of the stories in the film relates to a whistleblower named Tyler Furman, who [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=741.4s)]
*  was a dyed-in-the-wool young Republican who nevertheless, as a traditional conservative [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=747.8s)]
*  Republican, objected to the idea of a kind of state-sponsored bailout of a failing company, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=753.5999999999999s)]
*  the kind of thing the Republicans used to object to as crony capitalism. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=759.88s)]
*  He objected to it, so he was on the side of the signature collectors. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=764.38s)]
*  And then he gets approached by an old pal of his who's now working for a householder [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=769.74s)]
*  to say, how would you like to spy on those folks that you're working with now? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=775.06s)]
*  And he initially says, absolutely not. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=779.82s)]
*  But then he reports it to the FBI and the FBI says, no, go back and tell them you will [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=782.14s)]
*  do it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=786.5s)]
*  And then they put a body wire and a phone tap on Tyler and ultimately they were able [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=787.5s)]
*  extraordinary evidence from this guy, Matt Borges, who was part of the conspiracy to [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=792.54s)]
*  defraud the state of Ohio. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=797.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=799.66s)]
*  And of course, it's money. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=801.14s)]
*  Will they give him 15,000 cash or something? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=802.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=804.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=805.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=806.9s)]
*  No, he was being Tyler to betray his pals. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=807.9s)]
*  And Tyler was willing to do it because he was an informant now for the FBI and ultimately [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=811.38s)]
*  revealing much of how the case worked. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=816.3399999999999s)]
*  And I think a lot of Tyler's evidence was hugely useful at trial because it's so this [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=820.58s)]
*  money goes into negative advertising, which turns out to be quite effective. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=826.46s)]
*  They saturate the airwaves. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=831.34s)]
*  First of all, they promote it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=833.5400000000001s)]
*  We should be clear as a clean energy bill. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=834.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=838.62s)]
*  And if you want clean air, make sure you vote for the I mean, so nuclear power plant, which, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=841.34s)]
*  by the way, part of the bill was to shut down all of this wind power. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=848.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=853.2199999999999s)]
*  And to actually subsidize some coal companies. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=854.2199999999999s)]
*  So you couldn't ask for a dirtier clean energy bill than this one. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=858.38s)]
*  But the problem is the opponents don't have those resources by which they can counter [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=865.4599999999999s)]
*  the smears. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=869.6999999999999s)]
*  And the dirty tactics they use to go after people who oppose the bill. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there was a scene in there. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=878.8199999999999s)]
*  It was a poor guy like left a bar. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=880.3399999999999s)]
*  He was running for the legislature and he'd had one beer or something. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=884.6999999999999s)]
*  So they stopped him. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=890.9799999999999s)]
*  He wasn't drunk. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=892.62s)]
*  But they just twisted that into this. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=893.62s)]
*  You show the ad in the film. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=896.5799999999999s)]
*  They destroyed it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=899.62s)]
*  We showed the body cam footage. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=900.62s)]
*  He had to do a sobriety test. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=902.4599999999999s)]
*  He passed it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=904.0999999999999s)]
*  But they didn't mention that in the ad. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=905.0999999999999s)]
*  And of course, that was one of the few swing districts in Ohio. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=907.42s)]
*  Ohio is a terribly gerrymandered state. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=910.4599999999999s)]
*  But I think he lost by a handful of votes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=913.3399999999999s)]
*  But a lot of the money behind the negative campaigning for this Christian nationalist [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=916.0999999999999s)]
*  opponent of his came from first energy. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=925.42s)]
*  So that was one of the ways that they were muscling the whole system. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=930.6999999999999s)]
*  Make sure to run against people who are vulnerable. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=935.88s)]
*  Get them out of office. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=941.88s)]
*  Make sure to fill up the campaign coffers of some of your allies and let them know that [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=943.52s)]
*  in exchange for that, they owe you favors like voting for House Bill 6. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=949.52s)]
*  And so it's a series of interlocking favors. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=955.32s)]
*  But all these interlocking favors, which let's face it, are traditional tools of the political [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=959.68s)]
*  system. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=965.64s)]
*  But they're made possible and made far more corrupt by the application of tens of millions [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=966.64s)]
*  of dollars, which to the public is completely invisible. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=971.12s)]
*  Because in this case, in the case of Ohio, as opposed to say, Elon Musk during the presidential [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=974.28s)]
*  campaign, nobody knew where all this money was coming from. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=979.1999999999999s)]
*  There was a cutout company called Generation Now, which was part of this 501C4. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=985.6s)]
*  Nobody knew what Generation Now was. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=993.34s)]
*  Nobody knew where the money came from. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=995.2s)]
*  But Generation Now was paying for massive amounts of negative ads toward people who [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=997.08s)]
*  were opposing householders' agenda. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1001.6s)]
*  We should talk about gerrymandering. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1004.2800000000001s)]
*  My friend Dennis Kucinich lost his House seat when it was gerrymandered, we should be clear, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1006.36s)]
*  by the Democratic Party at the time, not the Republican Party. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1011.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, you show a map, and it doesn't make any sense, of course. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  What you gerrymander so that essentially the Republican Party in Ohio is guaranteed a kind [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1018.2s)]
*  of majority. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1024.52s)]
*  Well, this is just writ, of course, nationwide. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1025.52s)]
*  So actually, contested seats are in the minority. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1028.72s)]
*  Correct. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1033.52s)]
*  And that way, let's just say that you live in a purple state. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1034.8799999999999s)]
*  And Ohio has not died in the wool red. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1040.84s)]
*  But let's just say you live in a purple state, which is 53 to 47 in the red. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1043.28s)]
*  But in the legislature, it might be 70-30 red because of the way they gerrymander the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1051.36s)]
*  state. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1056.84s)]
*  There is one example. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1057.84s)]
*  We have, again, another Republican judge, a woman named Maureen O'Connor, who was the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1058.84s)]
*  Supreme Court Justice in Ohio, opposed this outrageous gerrymandering and was much vilified [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1067.1999999999998s)]
*  by the hard right part of the Republican Party. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1074.04s)]
*  She points out there was one district called the Snake on the Lake, which is just a little [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1078.32s)]
*  ribbon of territory along Lake Michigan, which is there only to be able to capture the group [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  that they want to capture. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1092.84s)]
*  It bears no relation to what you would call a community because a community is full of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1094.0s)]
*  lots of different kinds of people. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1099.6s)]
*  But the key to the gerrymandering is packing and cracking. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1101.88s)]
*  You crack up reliable districts of the opposition and pack them into one district so that you [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1106.56s)]
*  can have the rest. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1114.68s)]
*  Well what's amazing is that because of the gerrymandering, despite overwhelming repulsion [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  by most voters in Ohio, the speaker, and now it's been exposed. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1122.24s)]
*  I mean, he's going to trial. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1128.28s)]
*  He gets re-elected. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1129.4s)]
*  Well, he gets re-elected after he's convicted. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1130.4s)]
*  Oh, it was after he convicted. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1133.24s)]
*  Great. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1134.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not a surprise to us now we have a president for whom that is true. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1135.92s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1139.5600000000002s)]
*  How much, I mean, for me it was a kind of microcosm of the whole system, isn't it? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1141.68s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1145.68s)]
*  That's why we use the Ohio example because it's rare because of these wiretaps that you [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1146.68s)]
*  get a kind of vivisection of how the corruption works. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1152.88s)]
*  But I think the important thing about the Ohio story is that this is likely the kind [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1156.8000000000002s)]
*  of thing that's going on in every state. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1162.0s)]
*  The other thing that was delicious about the Ohio story is that kind of as a sort of corrupt [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1164.68s)]
*  response to the high-minded principles of the Supreme Court in saying, well, Citizens [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1173.4s)]
*  United will never lead to corruption. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1180.3600000000001s)]
*  All these guys are chuckling on wiretaps saying, huh, since Citizens United, bribery is legal. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1182.8s)]
*  We can do whatever we want now. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1189.6000000000001s)]
*  They're just howling over the fact that Citizens United was a gateway to bribery. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1191.84s)]
*  Now these guys went so far over the line that they were actually convicted. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1197.24s)]
*  But I'm sure other people are more sophisticated in terms of the wink and the nod between the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1201.48s)]
*  super PAC that's independent and the candidate in terms of making sure that they're aligned. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1206.6799999999998s)]
*  Speaking of relating it to the national scene, what was it recently, there was I believe [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1213.72s)]
*  a one million a person candlelight dinner at Mar-a-Lago and for a super PAC called MAGA [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1220.0s)]
*  Inc. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1225.28s)]
*  But by law, MAGA Inc. can't coordinate with Trump's campaign organization. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1230.28s)]
*  So invitations say that Trump is a guest speaker. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1234.2s)]
*  Now do you imagine that there's any coordination between Trump and MAGA Inc.? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1238.52s)]
*  Oh, perish the thought. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1243.56s)]
*  I want just before we go on to the second film, talk a little bit about one of the central [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1246.64s)]
*  characters in the film, Clark, who ends up committing suicide. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1251.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you leave that open. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1256.48s)]
*  Do you think it was suicide? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  I do think it was suicide. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1260.4s)]
*  I mean, I think there were people initially who thought it might have been murder, you [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1261.4s)]
*  know, because he was exposing a lot of dirty laundry. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1268.0s)]
*  He was a lobbyist that I think would have gone to trial with arrest, but before going [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1271.32s)]
*  to trial, he ended up committing suicide. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1275.52s)]
*  He commits suicide, by the way, wearing a t-shirt, a campaign t-shirt for Mike DeWine, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1277.7s)]
*  who is the governor of Ohio. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1284.04s)]
*  That was, I think, a not so subtle way of saying that the death and Neil Clark's activities [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  were directly related to Mike DeWine. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1291.52s)]
*  And we do know that people have been investigating DeWine's complicity in the case. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1293.8799999999999s)]
*  But Neil Clark is an intriguing figure, and he's kind of the main character of the film, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1298.14s)]
*  because he's an air-knuckle brawler in the tradition of American politics. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1306.3400000000001s)]
*  But there's also something kind of decent about him, and he definitely, he has a sense [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1313.5s)]
*  of right and wrong, and yet he rationalizes what became his utterly corrupt behavior in [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1323.3s)]
*  ways that ultimately, I think, caused him not to believe he could live with himself. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1329.26s)]
*  So in that sense, he's kind of a metaphor for the way in which so many Americans have [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1334.02s)]
*  kind of rationalized bad behavior for the sake of money. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1341.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you narrate the film, and I think you come to the conclusion that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1346.1399999999999s)]
*  he believed that he was not committing a crime. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1351.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1355.02s)]
*  Well, I think he convinced himself that he was not committing a crime, and that was very [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1356.02s)]
*  much the speech he made to the FBI when the FBI tried to get him to flip, which he refused [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1360.22s)]
*  to do, because he was convinced that Citizens United made all of this stuff okay. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1367.86s)]
*  But it's not okay, even with Citizens United, when a candidate is literally getting money [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1374.56s)]
*  from the party that he's about to enrich through a bill in Congress. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1383.1599999999999s)]
*  So this was, it was technically a bailout bill for First Energy, is that correct? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1391.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1395.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1396.08s)]
*  And I think from the film, what the president or CEO or something of First Energy immediately [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1397.08s)]
*  after the bailout, like took a hundred million dollar cut or something, is that right? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1401.44s)]
*  No, there was, it was evident that they were going to use this money to do some financial [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1407.44s)]
*  prestidigitation, which would have caused them to earn maybe a hundred million dollars [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1415.48s)]
*  of ill-gained profits themselves. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1421.8400000000001s)]
*  But also, you kind of get the sense, this is a utility, right, who's providing energy [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1426.16s)]
*  to the citizens of Ohio, and I'm sure in public they're also dedicated to the public good. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1431.52s)]
*  But in private, a group of these guys sent around an email in which they put their heads [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1440.6399999999999s)]
*  on Mount Rushmore, and the message at the bottom was, fuck anybody who ain't us. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1447.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  It was kind of like an end run. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1455.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1457.0400000000002s)]
*  Asked why. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1458.0400000000002s)]
*  What's the famous phrase from Jeff Skilling? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1459.0400000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about the second film. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1465.2s)]
*  There were several points in that that I found really fascinating. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1466.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, we can talk about Schenck at the end, but so you have the anti-abortion movement [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1470.2800000000002s)]
*  primarily in the out of the Christian right. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1479.5200000000002s)]
*  And so they are backing all sorts of candidates like Bush and Reagan, but in fact, they're [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1483.68s)]
*  not overturning Roe v. Wade, which is their main demand. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1491.2s)]
*  They're being played by these politicians. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1494.44s)]
*  And so there's a kind of epiphany, and I want to talk about Leo. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1499.68s)]
*  What's his last name? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1508.64s)]
*  Leonard Leo. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Leonard Leo. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1510.8400000000001s)]
*  Leonard Leo. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  Because he becomes a major focus of your film. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1513.8s)]
*  But I had written a book on the Christian right, American fascists, the Christian right, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1518.6799999999998s)]
*  the war in America, and I knew that there was Walmart money and this and that hobby [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1522.4399999999998s)]
*  lobby, but I didn't understand until I watched the film that this was a completely upfront [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1528.9599999999998s)]
*  transactional relationship, the decision on the part of the Christian right to get into [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1537.32s)]
*  bed with the billionaire class, because nobody wants what the billionaires want, of course, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1544.76s)]
*  except billionaires, but and to fund their movement. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1549.96s)]
*  There was a very unholy alliance. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1553.48s)]
*  And was it Leonard Leo? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1555.08s)]
*  Was he the one whose house you showed his like big house in Maine? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1558.84s)]
*  I mean, these people also made a killing on this stuff. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1561.96s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  That was really, really interesting. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1565.88s)]
*  Well, it's a little complicated, but let me see if I can break it down. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1566.88s)]
*  I mean, as you suggest, there was a deal made between the religious right, principally evangelical [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1570.7600000000002s)]
*  Christians and big money. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1579.24s)]
*  Big money wanted to get rid of regulations. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1582.0800000000002s)]
*  They didn't want any regulations on things like pollution or cigarettes or voting rights [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1583.68s)]
*  and particularly campaign finance limits. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1593.16s)]
*  And the religious right wanted one thing in particular. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1596.76s)]
*  They wanted to end abortion, but they needed money to do it. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1599.28s)]
*  And indeed the lawyer who ends up taking down Citizens United, a guy named Jim Bob from [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1602.8000000000002s)]
*  Indiana, you know, he started out as very much a character whose sole job was to work [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  for the abolition of Roe v. Wade. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1615.72s)]
*  So these groups joined forces. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1619.84s)]
*  And as Reverend Bob Schenck, who was an evangelical minister, one of these guys who used to show [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1623.76s)]
*  up at anti-abortion rallies with literally, you know, aborted fetuses, hardcore guy, you [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1629.26s)]
*  at one point, you know, sure, we can baptize the billionaire's money. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1640.36s)]
*  And he quotes something which became the title of the film, which is the wealth of the wicked [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1649.7199999999998s)]
*  can be laid up for the righteous. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1654.6399999999999s)]
*  And it testifies to a kind of religious corruption. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1657.0s)]
*  Now into this larger picture, enter a guy named Leonard Leo, who's not a Protestant. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1659.9599999999998s)]
*  He's a Catholic, a very conservative Catholic. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1665.56s)]
*  He's a lawyer, comes out of the Federalist Society, but he shares with the evangelicals [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1669.6799999999998s)]
*  a desire or a belief that conception begins not only, that life begins not only at conception, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1677.08s)]
*  but actually before conception, which is what Pope John Paul II said. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1687.24s)]
*  So he's radically opposed to abortion. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1691.26s)]
*  And his job is to use money, in many cases, dark money, to fund the campaigns not of candidates [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1693.94s)]
*  for office, but of Supreme Court justices. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1703.82s)]
*  Because what's one mechanism you could use that doesn't depend on the popular will to [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1707.12s)]
*  get your way? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1715.18s)]
*  Well, you pack the Supreme Court. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1716.18s)]
*  Because the Supreme Court, in a way, as Justice Scalia says in the film, is a supremely undemocratic [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1718.54s)]
*  organization. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1724.54s)]
*  And if you can co-opt or corrupt the Supreme Court and pack it with anti-abortion zealots, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1725.8999999999999s)]
*  then you can get what you want done. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1732.82s)]
*  And along the way, if you match up the justices with pals who happen to have a lot of money, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1735.56s)]
*  over time, the Supreme Court justices also began to intuit that deregulatory agenda. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1746.88s)]
*  I just want to stop you, August, because that's a really interesting part of your film. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1753.5200000000002s)]
*  You spend a lot of time on the Supreme Court, and you show how incestuous the relationship [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1757.3000000000002s)]
*  is, and Leonard Leo did a lot of setting up, I believe, of this kind of stuff, between [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  these incredibly wealthy donors and the justices. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1770.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1774.38s)]
*  What Schenck is doing from the evangelical Protestant side, Leonard Leo is doing from [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1775.76s)]
*  the Catholic side. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1780.0s)]
*  And basically what they're doing, literally taking people and showing them the back door [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1781.6s)]
*  of the Supreme Court and ingratiating them with the Supreme Court justices, so that they [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1788.3799999999999s)]
*  end up being friends with these billionaires who take them on lovely trips, fishing trips. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1794.64s)]
*  Well, they buy them. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1800.04s)]
*  It wasn't Clarence Thomas driving a $200,000 RV. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1801.72s)]
*  RV? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1806.4s)]
*  Yes, it was a loan which was mysteriously forgiven. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1807.4s)]
*  Right, it was forgiven. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1811.1200000000001s)]
*  And lo and behold, this person ended up having business before the Supreme Court. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1813.96s)]
*  So it's a transactional relationship, but also these justices, as Schenck points out, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1818.04s)]
*  are kind of lonely. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1824.68s)]
*  And so they called them stealth missionaries, is what Schenck called them, very wealthy [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1826.82s)]
*  people that they would introduce to the justices. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1832.04s)]
*  And over time, they would engage in a kind of romance. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1834.1799999999998s)]
*  It wasn't really a romance, but they would engage in these friendships that ultimately [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1839.1799999999998s)]
*  would have the effect of turning their perspectives in a very pro-corporate direction, which is [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1843.4199999999998s)]
*  decisions of the Supreme Court. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1854.7s)]
*  But they also control the nomination process. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1857.06s)]
*  So I mean, they're stacking. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1859.78s)]
*  They've already stacked the court. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1862.82s)]
*  And then after you talk about that, I want you to talk about Trump and what happened [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1865.3s)]
*  with the Federalist Society and their list of candidates. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1871.98s)]
*  That might be the way to get into it, because how do you stack or pack the Supreme Court? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1878.46s)]
*  Now, obviously, we know about some of Mitch McConnell's crazy procedural inventions. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1883.26s)]
*  Well, this is with Merrick Garland. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1890.86s)]
*  They just refused to hold hearings while Obama's in office. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1897.98s)]
*  Even though Obama had some months to go. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1903.22s)]
*  And then, of course, they rammed through somebody else in the last month or so of Trump's term. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1905.36s)]
*  But I think that the point here is that in order to pack the court, it turns out that [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1913.22s)]
*  you can do quite a bit to elevate the profile of people with the application of money. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1924.7s)]
*  And in the case of Trump, who may be, unless you go back to the Gilded Age, the most transactional [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1934.56s)]
*  president of our time, he then sees this because he knows he'll have the religious right in [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1942.9s)]
*  his pocket in 2016 if he waves a list, sort of like the Joe McCarthy list of people in [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1950.6200000000001s)]
*  the State Department. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1957.26s)]
*  He waves a list. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1958.5s)]
*  I have a list of judges from which I'm going to nominate Supreme Court justices, and they're [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1959.5s)]
*  all going to be opposed to abortion. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1966.6200000000001s)]
*  So if you want to end Roe v. Wade, vote for me. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  It was that simple. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1972.06s)]
*  And the person who put that list together for Donald Trump was Leonard Leo, who is a [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1973.3s)]
*  very intense conservative Catholic. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1978.58s)]
*  And not surprisingly, almost all of the Supreme Court bench is comprised either of practicing [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1983.7s)]
*  conservative Catholics or people who were raised Catholics and are now high Episcopalian, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1991.6s)]
*  which is Gorsuch. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1997.22s)]
*  The other thing they do is you have a clip from Anita Hill. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=1999.8999999999999s)]
*  You have the Kavanaugh hearing. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2003.54s)]
*  They go, and of course Clarence Thomas with Anita Hill, but they're accused of sexual [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2007.2199999999998s)]
*  assault. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2014.9799999999998s)]
*  And part of this dark money goes to destroy the credibility or attempt to destroy the [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2016.54s)]
*  credibility of the victims. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2021.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2024.3s)]
*  And that gets back to the kind of thing that Larry Householder was doing in Ohio. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2025.46s)]
*  You run negative ads effectively, and the negative ads are paid for mysterious dark [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2030.8600000000001s)]
*  money forces. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2036.7s)]
*  Leonard Leo's key function for the longest time was to raise money. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2041.14s)]
*  That's what he was really good at. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2045.94s)]
*  He's not an intellectual. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2047.42s)]
*  But isn't there in the film, what do they give him, a billion? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2048.42s)]
*  How much is it? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2051.26s)]
*  I mean, is it a billion and a half? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2052.26s)]
*  Well, later on he was rewarded. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2053.26s)]
*  There's a billionaire named Barry Side who basically dropped over a billion dollars into [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2054.86s)]
*  an organization run by Leonard Leo. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2061.9s)]
*  So now Leonard Leo is a huge broker for conservative causes because he has massive amounts of money [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2064.1400000000003s)]
*  at his disposal. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2070.94s)]
*  And that also was a kind of tax dodge because it was a way of Barry Side avoiding a tremendous [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2072.9s)]
*  amount of taxes even as he dumped over a billion dollars into the pockets of an organization [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2080.02s)]
*  run by Leonard Leo so that he could pursue the kinds of agendas that Side was interested [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2086.86s)]
*  in. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2093.06s)]
*  Let's talk about Shank. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2094.58s)]
*  I found him maybe the most interesting character in the film. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2095.98s)]
*  So at the beginning, you have these clips of a young Shank. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2100.28s)]
*  He's a minister. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2104.1s)]
*  He's carrying aborted fetus in his hand outside of abortion clinics. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2105.5s)]
*  He's harassing the poor women who want to go into the clinics. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2111.3s)]
*  It's very ugly. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2116.58s)]
*  But he has a kind of epiphany. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2120.24s)]
*  I mean, obviously has some kind of a conscience. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2124.82s)]
*  Let's talk about him a little bit, what he saw and his conclusions about what all this [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2128.02s)]
*  did to the Christian right in particular. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2134.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2138.04s)]
*  Well, he begins to be a student of the corruption of the Christian right and not just a student [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2139.04s)]
*  from afar. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2145.88s)]
*  He sees it from the inside out. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2146.88s)]
*  The first time he kind of sees it is in 2016 when the evangelical Christian groups all [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2150.44s)]
*  decide to throw their weight behind Trump. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2161.52s)]
*  And he's extremely uncomfortable because Trump is not a paragon of virtue. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2165.64s)]
*  Trump is not somebody who you would think of as being imbued by the principles of Jesus [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2170.7400000000002s)]
*  Christ. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2177.08s)]
*  He's just the opposite. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2179.44s)]
*  He's a vain, corrupt womanizer, woman abuser who is anathema to everything that they theoretically [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2180.44s)]
*  stand for. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2191.68s)]
*  But as one evangelical minister put it to Shank, he'll get us the court we need. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2192.68s)]
*  So suddenly a light bulb goes off in Shank's head. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2198.88s)]
*  It's like, this doesn't feel right to me, but I'm going to go along with it for the [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2202.64s)]
*  moment. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2206.08s)]
*  And then he has a moment when he's put in jail overnight as a result of one of his demonstrations. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2207.28s)]
*  In sort of the bizarro reverse of the civil rights movement, he becomes one of these characters [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2216.6000000000004s)]
*  who in pursuing his anti-abortion agenda is routinely put into jail for extreme demonstrations. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2223.5s)]
*  He's in jail one night and he hears a woman wailing for her children because she's been [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2230.76s)]
*  imprisoned without access to her children. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2235.6s)]
*  And that sets off in him a series of kind of reverberations as he begins to realize [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2239.08s)]
*  that in his crusade to protect the unborn child, he hasn't really been paying any attention [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2244.4s)]
*  to the crisis of mothers who must live lives, who have to sometimes agonize over a decision [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2253.04s)]
*  that is very personal and important to them. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2263.8599999999997s)]
*  And they're the ones who are carrying these fetuses. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2266.74s)]
*  They're the ones who have to live the real world as opposed to the phony world of the [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2270.62s)]
*  imagined beautiful life that the evangelical Christians posit, that every child will be [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2276.18s)]
*  born into a land of plenty where all the neighbors will come and help. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2283.06s)]
*  And so he begins step by step by step to undergo a kind of transformation where he begins to [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2288.9s)]
*  realize that he was wrong. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2298.34s)]
*  He was wrong about the violence he used to meet on women, or he used to threaten violence [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2299.82s)]
*  he used to meet on women by, you know, in so many of the demonstrations. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2305.34s)]
*  He was wrong to have ignored their needs and their rights for so long. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2312.44s)]
*  And actually, even before the overturning of Roe v. Wade, he writes an editorial or [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2319.32s)]
*  an op-ed in the New York Times saying he now is, you know, is for Roe v. Wade, that every [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2324.0s)]
*  woman should have the right to choose. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2332.36s)]
*  So it's a very moving conversion experience that he has because he follows an ethical [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2335.24s)]
*  path that it took some time for him to get to. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2344.4399999999996s)]
*  But he allows for the possibility of changing his mind as a way of engaging with an essential [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2349.16s)]
*  moral code. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2361.3999999999996s)]
*  But it comes at a very steep price. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2363.12s)]
*  Yes, he loses everything. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2364.96s)]
*  But you can see that, and that in its own way is inspiring in this moment, when so many [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2368.0s)]
*  people, universities, law firms, are doing the wrong thing for the sake of money. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2375.16s)]
*  We have a fiduciary responsibility to our partners, blah, blah, blah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2384.48s)]
*  Just like Columbia, its sole purpose is to protect their endowment, I guess, and their [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2391.2s)]
*  real estate holders. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2395.3999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2396.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's what I said, universities and law firms. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2397.3999999999996s)]
*  And Columbia was the first to bend the knee. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2398.7599999999998s)]
*  And they bent the knee, they should have read the art of the deal. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2401.04s)]
*  They bent the knee even before they had actually made a deal with Trump, which ensured that [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2404.3999999999996s)]
*  Trump was going to ask for more and more and more because, of course, Trump only wants [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2410.7s)]
*  to destroy the universities. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2415.2799999999997s)]
*  That's his goal. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2416.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, they thought it was a good faith conversation. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2417.8399999999997s)]
*  They didn't understand it was a complete misreading of power. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2420.8s)]
*  Correct. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2424.92s)]
*  And the intent of power. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2425.92s)]
*  But also, they didn't properly reckon with the principles of an educational institution [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2426.92s)]
*  as opposed to moving quickly to protect the financial underpinning of the institution. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2434.52s)]
*  So, you know, and that was clearly the problem of the law firms, too. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2441.84s)]
*  So the two films together, I think, really explain how we got where we are. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2446.12s)]
*  Where are we? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2455.2799999999997s)]
*  We're in a system of legalized bribery. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2456.2799999999997s)]
*  It's more like Al Capone's Chicago than what we think of as American democracy. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2461.3999999999996s)]
*  And even worse, thanks to this Supreme Court, which I think was deeply corrupted, we have [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2468.28s)]
*  a decision which allows complete and utter immunity from prosecution for the president [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2476.6400000000003s)]
*  of the United States, so long as his acts are part of his official capacity as president. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2484.6800000000003s)]
*  So you can have a president who can engage in bribery so long as it's part of his presidential [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2492.52s)]
*  brief and then all the way down the line, he enforces loyalty, not only through the [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2501.0s)]
*  application of money via his friend, Elon Musk, but also through the stick or through [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2506.98s)]
*  the carrot of knowing that if you do something that's loyal to the capo di tudicapi, then [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2514.36s)]
*  you will be pardoned because he has, in addition to having a get out of jail free card, he's [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2521.64s)]
*  too big to jail, he also has the power to get everybody else out of jail. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2527.28s)]
*  Imagine, I mean, it's like buying, like I say, it's like buying the police chief in [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2532.0s)]
*  Chicago. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2539.28s)]
*  But he's also destroyed, I mean, I'm sure you do, too, well aware of the very dark history [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2541.68s)]
*  of the FBI that went after COINTELPRO and the Black Panthers and everything else. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2547.6s)]
*  On the other hand, when the FBI functions as the FBI should function or when the police [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2553.92s)]
*  functions as it should function, it serves a very vital role in a democracy. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2558.56s)]
*  He's destroyed those institutions as well, which means now there's just no mechanism [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2565.2799999999997s)]
*  by which corruption, malfeasance can be investigated and with the Department of Justice, essentially [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2574.3199999999997s)]
*  none of it can be enforced. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2583.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2586.16s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that Donald Trump is trying to destroy the rule of law. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2587.3199999999997s)]
*  After all, that's what Vladimir Putin did. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2593.08s)]
*  The last remaining holdout, of course, is the court system, which is showing itself [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2596.6s)]
*  even though it has no power to enforce its rulings. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2601.64s)]
*  We get closer and closer and closer to open confrontation, particularly if the Supreme [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2606.68s)]
*  Court actually shows some spine, which is an open question. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  But I think if law is only based on personal loyalty, then it's not law at all because [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2616.3199999999997s)]
*  it's not a law that applies to everyone. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2623.68s)]
*  I think even the rich in the society will find that ultimately what they thought protected [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2626.36s)]
*  their property no longer does. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2632.52s)]
*  One day, if they run afoul of Trump, they're going to be in the dock like everyone else. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2634.4s)]
*  It's funny, I did a film a number of years ago called Citizen K about Mikhail Kharkovsky, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2642.0800000000004s)]
*  who was Russia's richest oligarch. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2648.92s)]
*  In 2003, Putin put him in prison because he found him to be a political rival. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2651.84s)]
*  He spent 10 years in the gulag. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2660.44s)]
*  But that was an example of how in a crony capitalist country, if you don't bend the [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2662.92s)]
*  knee to the capo, then you find yourself in prison, even if you're the country's richest man. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2671.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's, you know, every autocracy essentially demands complete fealty and loyalty, no matter [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2678.48s)]
*  where you are on the social strata. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2688.96s)]
*  Where do you think we're headed? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2692.64s)]
*  Where do you, I mean, do you, I don't see, if the Department of Justice will not, of [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2694.12s)]
*  course, the Supreme Court has no ability, but at least you have, under the Supreme Court, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2698.36s)]
*  you have federal marshals, I mean, under the DOJ. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2702.44s)]
*  If they won't deploy, if they won't enforce, what, and I don't know how you look at Harvard's [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2705.84s)]
*  belated act of resistance, but what do you see happening? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2714.48s)]
*  Because it's happening with such rapidity. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2720.6000000000004s)]
*  We're falling so swiftly. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2724.36s)]
*  We are falling swiftly, but I think there are signs of resistance. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2726.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think the popular resistance, which was slow to manifest itself, is happening. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2729.48s)]
*  And there are even moments, bits and pieces of evidence where the popular will outflanks [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2734.88s)]
*  the power of money, such as in Wisconsin with the recent election of the Supreme Court Justice. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2742.28s)]
*  So it's bleak, it's dire, but at the bottom of Pandora's box was hope, and I think there [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2747.84s)]
*  is hope. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2756.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think every act of resistance is important, because at some point, you know, it's one [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2757.3999999999996s)]
*  of the things that was important to me about doing these two films, because everybody rolls [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2767.56s)]
*  their eyes about the role of money in politics, oh, of course, blah, blah, blah. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2771.44s)]
*  But when you really boil it down and you say, no, no, what this is, this is about bribery. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2775.7599999999998s)]
*  This is about somebody taking some money and giving it to somebody else so that they have [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2780.8399999999997s)]
*  an advantage that they get something that you won't get, your children won't get, because [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2785.24s)]
*  they're getting it because they paid somebody off. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2790.9599999999996s)]
*  I think most people are pretty opposed to that. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2793.4399999999996s)]
*  And once we see- [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2797.12s)]
*  But Alex, that's why they voted for Trump, many of them, because he promised to drain [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2798.12s)]
*  the swamp. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2801.7599999999998s)]
*  He wasn't wrong about the corruption in the swamp. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2802.7599999999998s)]
*  Of course, he's making it worse. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2805.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, of course, he is the swamp. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2806.64s)]
*  But I think also there are a lot of people, a lot of people voted. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2808.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, why people voted for Trump is dispiriting, but it's also hugely complex. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2813.68s)]
*  I think there was a huge amount of tribalism that went into that. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2819.9199999999996s)]
*  And also, you have a great many business people who just thought, well, he'll be good for [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2824.9199999999996s)]
*  business. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2832.52s)]
*  Well, think again. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2833.52s)]
*  Because he's a capricious man who is not tethered by anything except for self-aggrandizement [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2837.2s)]
*  and the need for revenge and demand for loyalty. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2845.52s)]
*  That's not, you know, even business likes a good stable environment. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2851.8799999999997s)]
*  Trump is not stable. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2856.3599999999997s)]
*  So I think people are beginning to see that the emperor has no clothes. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2858.64s)]
*  Will they act in time before he snuffed out, you know, what's left of American democracy [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2863.14s)]
*  remains to be seen. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2870.3s)]
*  But I think the hope is that we all say, no, you're not going to destroy it. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2871.56s)]
*  That was Alex Gibney on his two films, Ohio Confidential and The Wealth of the Wicked. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2877.82s)]
*  I want to thank Diego, Sophia, Max and Thomas, who produced the show. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2885.14s)]
*  You can find me at chrishedges.substack.com. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orR3DIHEMw4&t=2890.38s)]
