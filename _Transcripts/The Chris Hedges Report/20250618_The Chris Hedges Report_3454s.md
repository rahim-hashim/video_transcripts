# Why You Should Hate the Rich Even More (w/ Rob Larson)
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w)
*  The rich are different from us, F. Scott Fitzgerald is said to have remarked to Ernest Hemingway, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=0.0s)]
*  to which Hemingway allegedly replied, yes, they have more money. The exchange, although [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=15.9s)]
*  it never actually took place, sums up a wisdom Fitzgerald had that eluded Hemingway. The [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=22.16s)]
*  rich are different. The cocoon of wealth and privilege permits the rich to turn those around [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=28.46s)]
*  them into compliant workers, hangers-on, servants, flatterers, and sycophants. Wealth breeds, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=34.26s)]
*  as Fitzgerald illustrated in the Great Gatsby in a short story, the rich boy, a class of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=41.54s)]
*  people for whom human beings are disposable commodities. Colleagues, associates, employees, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=47.46s)]
*  staff, servants, gardeners, tutors, personal trainers, even friends and family bend to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=54.38s)]
*  the whims of the wealthy or disappear. Once oligarchs achieve unchecked economic and political [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=61.02s)]
*  power as they have in the United States, the citizens too become disposable. The public [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  face of the oligarchic class bears little resemblance to the private face. I, like Fitzgerald, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  was thrown into the embrace of the upper crust when young. I was shipped off as a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=79.38s)]
*  scholarship student at the age of 10 to an exclusive New England boarding school. I had [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=84.02s)]
*  classmates whose fathers, fathers they rarely saw, arrived at the school in their limousines [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=89.22s)]
*  accompanied by personal photographers and at times their mistresses so the press could [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=95.06s)]
*  be fed images of rich and famous men playing the role of good fathers. I spent times in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=100.46s)]
*  the homes of the ultra rich and powerful watching my classmates, who were children, callously [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=107.26s)]
*  order around men and women who worked as their chauffeurs, cooks, nannies and servants. When [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=113.1s)]
*  the sons and daughters of the rich get into serious trouble, there are always lawyers, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=118.42s)]
*  publicists and political personages to protect them. George W. Bush's life, along with Donald [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=123.14s)]
*  Trump's, is a case study in the insidious affirmative action for the rich. The rich [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=128.74s)]
*  have a snobbish disdain for the poor despite well publicized acts of philanthropy and the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=134.54s)]
*  middle class. These lower classes are viewed as uncouth parasites, annoyances that have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  to be endured, at times placated and always controlled in the quest to amass more power [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=146.66s)]
*  and money. My hatred of authority, along with my loathing for the pretensions, heartlessness [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=153.66s)]
*  and sense of entitlement of the rich comes from living among the privileged. It was a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=159.54s)]
*  deeply unpleasant experience, but it exposed to me their insatiable selfishness and hedonism. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=164.5s)]
*  I learned as a boy who were my enemies. The inability to grasp the pathology of our oligarchic [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=171.7s)]
*  rulers is one of our gravest faults. We have been blinded to the depravity of our ruling [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=178.01999999999998s)]
*  elite by the relentless propaganda of public relations firms that work on behalf of corporations [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=183.3s)]
*  and the rich. Compliant politicians, clueless entertainers in our vapid corporate funded [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=189.78s)]
*  popular culture, which holds up the rich as leaders to emulate, and assures us that through [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=195.82000000000002s)]
*  diligence and hard work we can join them keep us from seeing the truth. They were careless [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=201.18s)]
*  people, Tom and Daisy, Fitzgerald, Road of the wealthy couple, at the center of Gatsby's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=208.18s)]
*  life. They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=213.46s)]
*  their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=219.18s)]
*  clean up the mess they had made. Aristotle, Machiavelli, Alex de Tocqueville, Adam Smith [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=224.38s)]
*  and Karl Marx all began from the premise that there is a natural antagonism between the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  rich and the masses. Those who have too much of the goods of fortune, strength, wealth, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=236.06s)]
*  friends and the like are neither willing nor able to submit to authority, Aristotle wrote [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=241.34s)]
*  in Politics. The evil begins at home, for when they are boys, by reason of the luxury [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=246.94s)]
*  in which they are brought up, they never learn, even at school, the habit of obedience. Oligarchs [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=252.56s)]
*  these philosophers knew are schooled in the mechanisms of manipulation, subtle and overt [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=258.58s)]
*  repression and the exploitation to protect their wealth and power at our expense. Foremost [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=265.18s)]
*  among their mechanisms of control is the control of ideas. Ruling elites ensure that the established [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=271.42s)]
*  intellectual class is subservient to an ideology, in this case free market, capitalism, neoliberalism, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  globalization that justifies their greed. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=285.42s)]
*  ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, Marx wrote, the dominant material [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  relationships grasped as ideas. Joining me to discuss the pathology of our billionaire [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  class of rulers is Rob Larson, a professor of economics at Tacoma Community College and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=303.14s)]
*  the author of Mastering the Universe, the obscene wealth of the ruling class, what they [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=309.26s)]
*  do with their money and why you should hate them even more. So you begin the book with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=315.04s)]
*  a description, actually reminded me of a passage in A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  at the beginning of the book where he describes pre-revolutionary France and the insane amounts [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  of money amassed by the aristocratic and oligarchic elite where it takes six people to serve [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  this rich person their cup of hot chocolate. You kind of do the same thing in the beginning [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=342.66s)]
*  of your book just by talking about the insane squandering of wealth and of course you juxtapose [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  that to the working poor and a shrinking middle class. But let's just begin with the figures [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=356.94s)]
*  because you lay it out, this has been since you argue correctly of course, since the Gilded [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  Age, the age of the Romer Barons, the largest transference of wealth upwards in American [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=368.98s)]
*  history but before we get into the lifestyle of those who are in richest and was that a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  New Yorker writer who coined that term, explain where we are just in terms of data. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=382.06s)]
*  Yeah, for sure Chris. So there's a number of ways to chop up the wealth of a society [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  and you do see a lot of random statistics on social media feeds and stuff so it's good [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=394.94s)]
*  to actually start with your feet really on the ground. And most of the data that I cite [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=400.18s)]
*  in the book along these lines is from the World Inequality Database, a large international [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=404.82s)]
*  economist consortium on wealth and income inequality. It includes relative rock star [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  economists like Thomas Piketty and others. And the data that they have is pretty stunning. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=416.32s)]
*  I really recommend that people take a look at their website. They have a lot of country [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=421.1s)]
*  specific data and stuff that's very interesting and a lot of visualization. But the very [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=425.22s)]
*  shortest version, I like to cut to the chase and look at just the concentration of the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  wealth. We can go with income and chop it up at all kinds of levels but just at that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=433.94s)]
*  most basic level of resolution, if we stick with the richest 1% of US households by wealth, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=438.98s)]
*  just using that as the classic marker, we find last year we have data for us 2022 and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=446.26s)]
*  that richest 1% owned 35% of all US wealth and that's cash, that's real estate, that's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=452.02000000000004s)]
*  all kinds of investment portfolio assets, which is pretty serious. So again, that's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=460.66s)]
*  the 1% with 35% of all wealth. And if we look at for example, the middle 40% sort of the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=466.1s)]
*  middle class or professional class, we find that that middle 40% of households has not [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=474.02000000000004s)]
*  quite 28% of wealth, so definitely not a full share for them. And then the bottom half, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=479.58000000000004s)]
*  the bottom 50% of all US households, very similar to the bottom half in most regions [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=486.38s)]
*  of the world, you're looking at about 1.5% of the national wealth is owned by that half [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=491.92s)]
*  of the population. And of course, we should say many of the poor and working class households [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  that that encompasses do own some wealth, they'll own middle class American things like [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=505.04s)]
*  a car or perhaps some equity in their homes. But of course, when we look at wealth, we [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=510.76s)]
*  have to subtract debt from your assets, net wealth of course is what we really care about. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=516.04s)]
*  So very typically, that bottom half region by region will have 1%, 2% or negative a few [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=522.0799999999999s)]
*  percent if their debts outnumber their assets. So that's kind of the simplest picture. It's [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=529.5999999999999s)]
*  very similar worldwide, globally that richest 1% of households owns 40% of all wealth, pretty [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  similar numbers there. And there's a lot more we can add to that, but that's sort of the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=542.92s)]
*  broad outline. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=547.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, you talk about this global ruling oligarchy as being transnational. One of the points [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=549.24s)]
*  you make in your book is that they all collect passports from various countries. But yes, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  there is a supranational quality now to the billionaire class. Explain how that works. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is interesting. I recently did a small article on this specific subject for [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=568.04s)]
*  current affairs, looking at the ways that these people are able to move around the world [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=573.84s)]
*  so effortlessly, certainly compared to the middle class and obviously compared to the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  very poorest people in the world who migrate extra legally. So I feel like the passports [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=585.2s)]
*  thing actually is a good indicator. If you look at wealthy households, it's all kinds [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=590.88s)]
*  of assets. You own your home or your multiple homes outright, and you have plenty of cash [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  and so on. But then we get into the more exotic wealthy assets. And I often say some of the real [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=601.28s)]
*  family jewels of the wealthiest households are vaults full of passports and visa and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=606.88s)]
*  residency documents for countries in the world. Of course, most developed countries, it's [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=612.88s)]
*  possible to apply for residency that can lead to a permanent visa or a green card if you [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=619.04s)]
*  get an employment sponsor. But what's been happening more recently is a lot of countries, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  especially those that have a urgent balance of payments issue to correct, are making it [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=630.32s)]
*  much easier for wealthy people to just buy citizenship, sometimes starting with residency [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=636.88s)]
*  or just outright handing out passports to wealthy individuals who make qualifying property [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=643.04s)]
*  investments. And if you'll put a couple hundred thousand dollars into a firm in Spain or Greece [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=649.92s)]
*  or Ireland or Portugal or some other countries, and certainly many third world countries as well, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=656.64s)]
*  they'll put you on a path to gaining residency, including that incredibly valuable EU passport [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=662.16s)]
*  that is very sought after in the world. So that's a major thing. But of course, even if we [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=668.64s)]
*  get just past that specifically naked issue of selling citizenship to the rich, most countries, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=674.0s)]
*  wherever you're traveling, wherever you're trying to live large amounts of money, and just having [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=680.56s)]
*  staff, having someone who can keep up with all the requirements and all the paperwork and watch [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=686.0s)]
*  those deadlines as they come, that's exactly the kind of thing that a struggling poor person who's [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=691.84s)]
*  head of household with a bunch of kids isn't able to do. So to me, that international aspect of the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=696.88s)]
*  ruling class, it is the aspect that bothers the right wing the most. And when they talk about [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=703.04s)]
*  globalists, even if they don't specifically say Jewish globalists, you know it's in there. But [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=708.24s)]
*  it's often this sort of feature, these people are seen by the right to be rootless and they have no [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=714.08s)]
*  nationality. And of course, that's bad because nationality is how we get most of our right wing [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=720.08s)]
*  identity. But you don't have to be an arch conservative to see the downsides of a ruling [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=724.72s)]
*  class that's so much more mobile than the rest of us. Well, of course, when they park their money [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=729.5200000000001s)]
*  overseas, we saw that with the Panama Papers. Yeah, most extensively, absolutely. Let's talk [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  about Richestan. What it's like, I know I was there, it's disgusting. You spent the first part [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=741.04s)]
*  of the book describing life in Richestan where they really have no contact at all with the rest [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=747.5999999999999s)]
*  of us. If they ever deal with a member of the working class, it's somebody who works for them, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=756.56s)]
*  you know, whether it's their gardener, their chauffeur, their nanny. And of course, as you [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=764.16s)]
*  point out in the book, if these people are not completely obsequious, they very swiftly don't [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=770.08s)]
*  have a job. This creates a very distorted view of the world and understanding of the world because [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=775.84s)]
*  no matter how, you know, again, this is from your book, anything they say that's ridiculous [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=784.72s)]
*  or stupid just gets validated. I mean, we're watching Elon Musk is kind of the poster child [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=788.48s)]
*  for this at the moment. So but talk about Richestan life in Richestan. Because it is [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=793.44s)]
*  another world. It's they don't fly on commercial jets. They travel around the world in mega yachts. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=801.0400000000001s)]
*  But I'll let you I mean, you do a pretty good job of painting that world that I had to endure as a [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=808.8000000000001s)]
*  boarding school student. Yeah, thanks, Chris, I can do that. You know, just just brace yourself [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=814.48s)]
*  as you revisit some of these atrocities. Yeah, the first thing I always just tell people and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=820.0s)]
*  tell my students is just to start with the simplest aspect. If you are one of these really wealthy [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=825.44s)]
*  people, just start with the simple things like you own your home outright. It's just it's your [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=830.24s)]
*  property, you know, you're a wealthy person, you're not a debtor who borrows money to do purchases or [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=835.84s)]
*  to get a home or mortgage like I have, you know, that's a you're being a debtor. And that scenario, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=841.92s)]
*  if you're wealthy, you're a creditor, you have investments, you put money into the system, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=846.88s)]
*  other people borrow it to your profit, so they can have a mortgage or a car loan or whatever. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=851.04s)]
*  So just that basic security, I feel is something that's like, already so foreign to a lot of like [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=855.92s)]
*  conventional working and middle class people that I think it's a good place to start. Obviously, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=862.64s)]
*  though, beyond owning that primary residence, of course, these people have multiple residences, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=867.12s)]
*  and many are just seasonal, you merely summer there or winter in this place in the Caribbean. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=872.96s)]
*  And it means that most of the year, those properties are completely empty with no one around or perhaps [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=878.48s)]
*  some staff. Let me just interrupt because I was just in Belgrave Square in London a few days ago [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  and walking around at night and all of these these are where the luxury apartments are. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=890.96s)]
*  Almost all of them were dark, because no one inhabits them. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=895.44s)]
*  Indeed. And like many ruling class sort of level neighborhoods are like that if you walk through [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=899.5999999999999s)]
*  Midtown Manhattan and look at those very fancy, very tall, very ugly new billionaire catering [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  skyscrapers. I mean, you see some lights, few lights. Those people are in their other homes, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=911.92s)]
*  or they're Russian or Arab or European or other investors. And it's just purely a property to be [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=918.4s)]
*  flipped or to store some of your equity and will never be inhabited until you sell it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=924.48s)]
*  Amazing stuff. So that's a good place to start. The properties themselves, of course, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=929.84s)]
*  though, do get fairly crazy. I like to mention just a few examples. Obviously, there's a good [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=933.6800000000001s)]
*  deal in the book. One of the largest states down in Los Angeles County, one of these ones that's [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=939.28s)]
*  large enough to have a name and be a storied mansion. This is a recounting from the Wall [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=946.0s)]
*  Street Journal, I should mention through their very valuable Friday mansion supplement that they [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=951.68s)]
*  include in the physical paper. It doesn't go online just for subscribers. But they mentioned, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=957.28s)]
*  for example, this large mansion that has 40 rooms, or 60 if you include the servants quarters and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  the walk in silver, fur, and wine vaults in the basement. It's a completely different sort of [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  physical landscape. So that's the first thing to consider. And that's very real, of course, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=975.8399999999999s)]
*  and the effect that has on people's daily life is obviously large. But I really do think the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=980.72s)]
*  deeper insight into that wealthy psychology is exactly what you mentioned, Chris, and your [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=985.84s)]
*  relationship with the people around you. And we can talk about what this does to your friends, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=990.32s)]
*  but just purely focusing on the households here. Of course, if you're rich, you interact with the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=994.96s)]
*  working class, whose paychecks you sign, as you said, like that is the crucial thing. You don't [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  interact with just some independent blue collar person, you interact with people who've been [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1005.2s)]
*  brought into your estate by your prop by your home, or family manager, who pays your bills and [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1010.08s)]
*  brings contractors out to do different kinds of work. And obviously, this includes all the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1016.88s)]
*  maintenance and work that it takes to keep these very fancy properties on their feet. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1021.84s)]
*  But I also would say it's the it's that personal staff, though, that really shows you the issue. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1026.8s)]
*  And we mentioned, yes, the great book, Richestan, which is very enjoyable, a nice outline of the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1032.08s)]
*  mid 2000s ruling class before the 2008 crisis. So without even the shame that they kind of maybe [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1037.84s)]
*  remember from that episode, the journalist Frank Rich, and he said, and this is quoting his [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1045.1999999999998s)]
*  description here, because I think it's pretty memorable of some students who are in a, a home [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1050.24s)]
*  staff training academy. So being instructed in school on how to be what they used to call a [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1056.08s)]
*  butler, but that's now seen to be stuffy. So you go with, you know, household staff, which sounds [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  more neutral or corporate, which people prefer. And Rich mentions this about the training these [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1066.24s)]
*  people receive. He says, most of all, the students learn never to judge their employers, whom they [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1071.2s)]
*  call principals. So if a principal wants to feed her shih tzu braised beef tenderloin steaks every [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1078.24s)]
*  night, the butler should serve it up with a smile. If the principal is in Palm Beach, and wants to [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1084.96s)]
*  send his jet to New York to pick up a bottle of Chateau Latour from a Southampton cellar, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1090.56s)]
*  the butler makes it happen. No questions asked. And obviously, this is fairly gross and disgusting [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1096.08s)]
*  and wasteful on the face of it. But what I'd like to think of is just what does this do to your [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1102.0s)]
*  ability to relate to other people? I mean, most of the people you encounter during your day, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1107.2s)]
*  at least around your home, you know, are staff, and they're obliged to be nice to you and kiss [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  your ass all the time and never criticize you as they specifically are trained not to do. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1118.0s)]
*  You know, why would, what effect would we expect that to have on people? And of course, the effect [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1122.88s)]
*  is to make you an imperious, condescending jerk to everyone you deal with. And I always say, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1127.76s)]
*  the real way to see the power of this is to watch what happens when these characters are [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1132.48s)]
*  occasionally actually criticized. And to me, the definitive version of that in our lifetimes was [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1136.4s)]
*  the 2020 presidential debates where Elizabeth Warren, whatever one may think of her history [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1143.2s)]
*  of candidacies, really tore into Michael Bloomberg publicly during their debate. And, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1148.96s)]
*  you know, I think she could have gone a lot further. But she was very disparaging to his face. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1156.0s)]
*  And I invite people just to pull up the video of that and just look at Bloomberg's face in that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1160.56s)]
*  moment. Like he looks like he's seeing aliens arrive on the earth. He's so dumbstruck. It is [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1165.2s)]
*  the face of a man who's never been criticized to his face for 20 years. So I think that kind of [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1171.6s)]
*  shows you what happens to the relationships when you're deep in richest and like that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1176.48s)]
*  Well, you also there was a leak or something of tweets, was it to Elon Musk or somebody in the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1180.9599999999998s)]
*  book, where they, you know, all the people around him were basically just slobbering all over [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1186.8s)]
*  whatever silly idea he had. Oh, absolutely. God, that was, I remember that that was painful just [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1194.8s)]
*  to read the amount of groveling sycophancy that this brings out of people. And I think that's a [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1202.48s)]
*  big part of it too, especially because now we're often looking at people who I mean, some are, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1209.28s)]
*  but some of these people are not like directly being paid by Musk or his various firms. They're [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  like, you know, his nominal friends, some somewhat rich other acquaintances and so on. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1218.88s)]
*  And it's just nonstop wall to wall ass kissing. And everyone is like the, you the dynamic you see [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1224.72s)]
*  is people competing to kiss the powerful person's ass the most. Like that's the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1232.0s)]
*  dynamic that drives the group is like who's doing the most butt kissing. It's a very competitive [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  environment in that way. But I just tell my students like think what would happen to your [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1243.92s)]
*  brain if that's how your friends related to you. If everyone just tells you how great and brilliant [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1247.6s)]
*  and heroic you are, and anyone who criticizes you is just jealous, you would lose touch with reality. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1252.8s)]
*  You think you're fantastic. And you would act the way that Michael Bloomberg or Elon Musk do act, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  which is I am the second coming of Christ. You're so lucky to be speaking to me and have me ruling [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1263.6799999999998s)]
*  your life. Because it just destroys your ability to understand reality. If you're a middle or [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1268.7199999999998s)]
*  working class person, you get corrected by society. Your friends tell you like, yeah, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1273.2s)]
*  you should rethink that guy. You're embarrassing yourself. It's the kind of thing a normal person [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1277.68s)]
*  can say to one another that you would think twice about saying to someone of this stature. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it I mean, I have from personal experience, it destroys the capacity for empathy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1288.16s)]
*  Indeed. You know, that's what withers and dies. Oh, God, that's that's a good way of putting it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1293.3600000000001s)]
*  Should have put that in the book. And the other thing is that they're not really friends. Because [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1298.08s)]
*  a lot of the people who suck up to these sycophants, you know, suck up to these [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  rich people despise them. And there's a moment is a moment in your book where you talk about the [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1309.1999999999998s)]
*  paranoia of the ultra rich, because on some level, they recognize it, that people just want a piece [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  of them or a piece of their money or a piece of their power, but don't really like them. Yeah, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1321.6s)]
*  they're very lonely. I know having gone to school with a super rich, they're very lonely [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1326.64s)]
*  and unhappy people. And you also make that point in the book, I think it's anybody who earns what [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1331.8400000000001s)]
*  above 50,000 a year, I can't remember the figure. But once you start earning mega sums, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1338.48s)]
*  it doesn't it doesn't make you happy. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1344.96s)]
*  Indeed, but it does completely warp the economy and put insane demonic power in your hands. But [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1347.92s)]
*  it is amazing you dig into this. I mean, these characters, their lives are filled with, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1354.32s)]
*  I mean, just wall to wall pleasure, if people help them, do everything for them, provide them [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1359.2s)]
*  with the very finest things that are in the world. And then you gradually learn these people are kind [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1365.12s)]
*  of miserable. Like, what is this even all for? If you're not even enjoying your ruling class [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1370.72s)]
*  lifestyle, which we're ruining the planet to bring to you. And of course, sometimes I think [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1375.36s)]
*  people hear this and the tendency is to say, Oh, so we should really pity them like, No, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1380.16s)]
*  you can still be mad. But just these are actions that they took that didn't even redound to their [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1384.5600000000002s)]
*  own happiness. But you're right, it's common enough that it's apparently becoming clinically [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  recognized. In the book, you know, I cite a, you know, a professional therapist who mainly caters [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1393.68s)]
*  to very high end income clients in New York, if I recall. And she mentions, yeah, one of the most [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1399.3600000000001s)]
*  common things that we encounter in sessions is people, you know, clients who are very wealthy [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1406.08s)]
*  and saying, Do I really have any friends? All these people? I mean, maybe I grew up when they [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1410.8799999999999s)]
*  were my friends, or I came to know them. But now that I'm so rich, and not just rich, if I'm super [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1416.32s)]
*  powerful, or just a celebrity, it just makes friendship just yeah, you can't you can't put [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1421.04s)]
*  confidence in it. And it starts to look more and more transactional, like I really got to be [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1426.6399999999999s)]
*  close to this guy, maybe he'll have a few glasses of wine and feel like buying me a house or [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1431.36s)]
*  something. So keep that nose brown. You can see how that just leads you to you know, you don't [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1435.36s)]
*  even feel like you have the relationships you should have with friends, which is one of the [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1441.04s)]
*  most important things you can have in life. Of course, it's such a twisted picture. The [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1445.76s)]
*  more deformed you become, the less you know, the more odious you become. And part of the problem [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1449.76s)]
*  is among the rich themselves, it's how they how do they define friendship, they define friendship as [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1457.9199999999998s)]
*  what's in it for me. The moment a quote unquote friend gets in trouble, they go for the door. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1462.96s)]
*  It's a very perverted way to define friendship. That's something that I experienced, you know, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1470.4s)]
*  knowing a lot of these people. But let's talk about the just one other point. Remember, as you [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1477.92s)]
*  also point out in the book, it's not that these people, most of them became rich, most of them [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1485.76s)]
*  grew up rich. And having gone to school with the sons of the ultra rich, they their family life was [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1490.0s)]
*  a horror show, they almost never saw their parents. They were superfluous. They were, of course, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1499.52s)]
*  that's one of the reasons they were packed off to boarding school, and then turned around and sent [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1506.48s)]
*  off to summer camp. So they were already traumatized. There's a book called the trauma of the Privileged [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1510.96s)]
*  Child or something by a British psychologist, which talks about English boarding schools. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1518.32s)]
*  But we can't negate the fact that they were reared in this particular environment, where there was [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1523.52s)]
*  very little nurturing or love. And, and so it's not just that they're obscene wealth deforms their [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1533.76s)]
*  life. It's that they grew up, you know, as a child like this. Yeah, it's like a bonsai tree that was [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1544.32s)]
*  made to look ugly and be mean to people. Yeah, it's you grow up in this warped environment, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1551.04s)]
*  you know, like a potato growing in stony fields, and you come up with a weird, not quite correct [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1555.76s)]
*  or normal shape. Makes sense. And you know, again, like it is amazing to see how it extends to your [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1560.56s)]
*  own kids. But, you know, I got a two year old nephew myself, my god, he's such a sweet little [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1566.0s)]
*  kid, but he's a little terrorist. It's so much work taking care of kids. The first thing that even [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1571.28s)]
*  middle class do when they middle class people do, when they get some money is hire some help with [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1575.84s)]
*  the kids. And if you know, anyone's a parent out there will understand why it's so much work, you [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1580.56s)]
*  know, you love your kid, but just carry that forward. Once you have millions of dollars, well, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1585.6s)]
*  I can just offload all the childcare onto this person. And this is why we have all these famous [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1589.68s)]
*  stories. And, you know, every piece of media about rich people always has a joke about this from, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1594.48s)]
*  you know, succession to arrested development, about how the wealthy kids are closer to the [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1600.48s)]
*  domestic staff, or your or their nanny or whomever they designated, then they are to their own parents [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1605.28s)]
*  who are jetting around the world drinking champagne, having fun, not doing the hard work of changing [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1610.6399999999999s)]
*  their kids diapers, or even the medium difficulty work of having like serious conversations with [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1616.1599999999999s)]
*  them. And, you know, just having them with you while they explore the world as kids. It goes to [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1621.28s)]
*  show that when you have this kind of money, just that commercial ease can just intermediate itself [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1625.6s)]
*  between any relationship you have, even with your firstborn child. It's amazing. Yeah, Churchill, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1631.28s)]
*  this was you just explained, Churchill's parents, Winston Churchill's parents, and the only person [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1638.48s)]
*  he felt who really loved him was his nanny. And then when he finally went off to Sanders or wherever [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1644.1599999999999s)]
*  they fired her with no pension. And Churchill, I think until she died, sent his sent the nanny [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1649.68s)]
*  something meager probably every month. Let's talk about the political and the social consequences, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1656.5600000000002s)]
*  because the billionaire class runs the country. I mean, I described the last election as between [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1662.72s)]
*  corporate, the corporatists and the oligarchs, the corporatists embracing the Democratic Party, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1669.1200000000001s)]
*  and Biden and Harris, and the oligarchs embracing Trump oligarchs want something different from [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1675.76s)]
*  corporatists in that oligarchs, like chaos, they want to destroy the administrative state, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1681.68s)]
*  to quote Steve Bannon, because they make their money by setting up tollbooths, in essence, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1688.08s)]
*  between commodities, we just saw the CEO of United Health get assassinated, who knows where that came [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1693.84s)]
*  from. And of course, it's a horrible event. On the other hand, you know, the these for profit [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1699.68s)]
*  healthcare companies, their job, you know, to boil it down to its moral essence is to hold six [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1705.8400000000001s)]
*  children hostage, while parents frantically bankrupt themselves trying to save their sons or daughters [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1711.68s)]
*  a form of terrorism, really. So let's talk a little bit about now that it's the age of oligarchs, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1716.5600000000002s)]
*  private equity firms, which are about destruction of capital for short term profit. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1724.48s)]
*  I mean, that's why they've all coalesced around Trump deregulation, destruction of the Department [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1731.44s)]
*  of Education, everything will become privatized, because that's how they it's in its purest form [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1738.48s)]
*  rentier capitalism. Let's talk about how these individuals with this kind of power, given their [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1744.0800000000002s)]
*  psychological makeup, how they destroy the society at the end of the book, you talk about [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1752.08s)]
*  socialism, we're both socialists. I don't know if you're a Marxist, I'm not a Marxist, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1756.96s)]
*  kind of a Swedish socialist, but but we're socialists. But talk about the political and [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1760.48s)]
*  social consequences. Oh, yeah, of being ruled by the billionaire class, which we are. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1766.72s)]
*  We most certainly are, indeed. And that includes their corporate property. I saw in one of your [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1772.72s)]
*  previous videos, how you describe that 24 campaign of corporatists versus oligarchs. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1778.4s)]
*  I think that's that's thoughtful. That gets at a lot of the character of the ruling class configurations [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  on both parties. I mean, obviously, both of them had billionaires, both candidacies, I mean, for [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1789.92s)]
*  the White House, had billionaires backing them and plenty of support from the wealth of society. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1795.0400000000002s)]
*  But indeed, if you look at Trump, it's more Wall Street. Yes, exactly. Private equity, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1800.72s)]
*  capital destroying to reapportion some of it sort of hedge fund and private equity, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1806.88s)]
*  background of people all the way up to that Treasury appointment. That's so important. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1812.88s)]
*  It's true. And if you look at Harris, it is more conventional, traditional Republican and Democrat [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1816.8000000000002s)]
*  corporate support. But one thing I think is important just to connect that is just to mention [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1822.72s)]
*  something that goes back to the statistics behind this. Just one thing I always want to make sure [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1827.0400000000002s)]
*  people realize is that like the corporate world and all of its billion dollars of support for [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1831.52s)]
*  Harris's failed campaign, this stuff is the property of this same ruling class, just for [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1837.36s)]
*  people's familiarity with this. The big research we have on it comes from the economist Ed Wolf. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1843.2s)]
*  And his estimate was that the top 1% once again, of households owned 40% of all US stocks, and the [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1849.2s)]
*  top 10% owned 84%, which is almost all of it. So even if we are indeed looking at some oligarchs [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1858.0s)]
*  fighting against more corporate back candidates, fundamentally, all of this is the property and [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1866.08s)]
*  the domain of that rich ruling class just to sort of add that aspect to it. But the consequences of [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1870.96s)]
*  getting ruled by them are pretty intense. Obviously, on the policy side, we've been looking at 40 years [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1876.56s)]
*  of neoliberalism, and it's meant doing nothing about climate change, even as it has completely [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1883.68s)]
*  come to us now, and we are just living in it, watching 40 years of re- redistribution of wealth [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1889.2s)]
*  and bringing us a long distance back to that Gilded Age level of wealth concentration. We aren't [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1896.16s)]
*  quite back there yet, based on the data we have from that time. I'd say next year's tax cut that [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1901.52s)]
*  everyone expects probably get us most of the way there. So we'll explore that. Big consequences of [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1906.96s)]
*  these things, and not just that our middle and working class pay has stopped tracking productivity, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1912.64s)]
*  as we all know it stopped doing in the 70s, but also just what that does to the economy. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1918.64s)]
*  We have bubbles in so many markets now, those unsustainable spikes and crashes in assets. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1923.92s)]
*  Most of our markets now are insanely overheated. The stock market is ludicrously overvalued by any [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1931.2s)]
*  conventional price to earnings ratio valuation. Our real estate prices are stratospheric in this [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1938.48s)]
*  country. Any asset, cryptocurrency, the whole financial sector, they're hugely overvalued [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1944.8s)]
*  because so much of this wealth has gone back to these rich households. I tell my students, when [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1950.8s)]
*  middle class people get an income increase, we spend it on our needs. I have a health problem, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1956.4s)]
*  Junior needs braces, Susie needs a college fund, I've got a credit card to pay down. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1962.88s)]
*  That's what normal people do. If you're wealthy, as we've said, you already own your property, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1967.76s)]
*  you have the assets that you need. So wealthy people, when Reagan or Bush or Trump cut their [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1972.72s)]
*  taxes so much, most of that money just gets invested. And that means that's more cash chasing [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1978.56s)]
*  the same number of assets. And it just tends to have the effect of hideously inflating every asset [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1983.84s)]
*  market, making housing out of reach for so many people, making the market absurdly overpriced, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1989.28s)]
*  if you're concerned about that. The consequences are pretty rough from government policy all the [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1994.48s)]
*  way to its effect on the markets. And how does it distort the political system? I mean, you argue [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=1999.76s)]
*  in the book, which I agree with, that essentially these were the people who gave us Trump. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2007.2s)]
*  Oh, indeed. I mean, this story has kind of hit the public how important money is. I mean, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2013.44s)]
*  you know, Trump runs his campaign saying he's running against the power of money. And that was [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2017.92s)]
*  one of his big switchblades in the back of all of his Republican competitors in 2016 was saying, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2022.16s)]
*  I donate money to these people and they pick up my calls. You know, they always do. Like that [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2028.24s)]
*  spoke to people because it suggests a little of that Bernie Sanders populism, but with a bunch of [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2033.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump racism. So you can kind of have both. And that's part of his successful coalition there. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2038.0800000000002s)]
*  So these absolutely are the figures that brought us Trump. Again, you have like, it's fundamentally [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2043.44s)]
*  a social democratic country, despite it all to this day, and candidates that succeed usually at [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2049.2s)]
*  least pretend to be catering toward that. So Obama in 2008 talked all this progressive fight [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2055.68s)]
*  about codifying row and signing the card check act to make union elections easier, all this stuff, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2062.48s)]
*  and then backed off most of it, let Congress write the banks, re-regulation and used a right [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2069.44s)]
*  wing Republican healthcare plan to become his signature bill. When people see that they become [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2074.96s)]
*  cynical about left wing approaches and kind of have abandoned the Democrats in part, I think, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2080.0s)]
*  because of that switcheroo that they pull. Then you have figures like Clinton and Harris who refuse [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2086.08s)]
*  to even pretend. And then they're the ones that go down in flames, sadly. So watching the political [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2090.48s)]
*  parties adapt to this, the Republicans are working very hard on their working class cosplay, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2095.36s)]
*  which is a long standing ruling class pastime, as I review in the book, ever since we've had [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2101.04s)]
*  the wealthy, today billionaires back in the original Gilded Age, who was just millionaires [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2107.12s)]
*  with inflation. Ever since we've had that class distinction, these guys' favorite thing is to [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2112.56s)]
*  dress up like they're working class. Well, you actually write about the difference, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2118.4s)]
*  the way they used to dress in top hats and tails, and how now figures like Bezos show up in t-shirts [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2122.96s)]
*  and jeans. I just want to throw out, by the way, that John D. Rockefeller III was my graduation [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2132.88s)]
*  speaker at boarding school. That's, of course, who we were all, the Rockefellers went to my [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2138.96s)]
*  boarding school. That's who we were all supposed to emulate. But I thought that was kind of an [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2143.28s)]
*  interesting point. Just before we go on, explain that weird thing where the ruling class, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2147.84s)]
*  it used to be that you immediately knew who the ruling class was by the way they dressed, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2155.6800000000003s)]
*  and by manners. And you write in the book that it takes time to learn manners. That's true. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2162.1600000000003s)]
*  But believe me, that was a heavy form of indoctrination within [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2169.8399999999997s)]
*  boarding school. These elite boarding schools were manners. What were manners? But I came to see it [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2176.56s)]
*  as more, we were, you know, we, or I was supposed to be a member of the club, but I ended up being [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2181.7599999999998s)]
*  a heretic. But the ruling class, the 1%, had elaborate manners because the people who did [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2187.7599999999998s)]
*  the dirty work for them, they didn't have to do the dirty work. The goons, the thugs, the bankers, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2195.6s)]
*  they didn't do the dirty work. Their hands were clean. And it was, I looked at it as a kind of [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2202.7999999999997s)]
*  subterfuge. But talk about that issue and talk about the issue of dress, just because I found [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2208.64s)]
*  it kind of interesting. For sure. Yeah, it's a favorite of mine personally. So yeah, what we [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2213.44s)]
*  were referring to before was what wealthy people would do for fun dress up parties. In those days, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2218.64s)]
*  it was, you know, dressing up like hobos or something like that. Or, you know, or, well, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2224.8s)]
*  this was, this is an actual case you quoted about Colbaran where they would, I mean, the cruelty of [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2229.1200000000003s)]
*  it dressing up like hobos. I mean, they're all billionaires. And I think they were served in [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2234.32s)]
*  tin cups or something. And then you had another example of, I forget, was it Carnegie or somebody, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2239.2000000000003s)]
*  it was like a Versailles party and 50 women came as Marie Antoinette or... Oh, God. Yeah, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2245.76s)]
*  I forgot about that one. Yes, that's a really great one too. So this is like a long tradition. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2251.12s)]
*  And this goes all the way through today. Again, as you said, in the classic sort of Gilded Age era [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2256.4s)]
*  before the New Deal and labor movements made this sort of suspect to do that much outward display [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2262.64s)]
*  of wealth. As you said, these people would wear the most insane finery, like exaggerated beyond [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2268.72s)]
*  what European rich people would wear, which is already fairly dandy as it stands. But [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2274.32s)]
*  these days, it seemed to be generally your very wealthy people like to be more discreet [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2280.4s)]
*  in terms of their affectation. And so, I remember Kate Wagner, the great creator of the McMansion [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2287.92s)]
*  Hell blog that some of your viewers will know, she wrote for The Nation about how annoying it is [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2294.6400000000003s)]
*  that wealthy people don't even dress conspicuously different from us anymore. They're just boring. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2300.0s)]
*  Yeah, when you see Bill Gates, it's grandfatherly sweaters. When you see Elon Musk, it's some [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2305.52s)]
*  hideous t-shirt that doesn't fit his body. And it's annoying. However, The Wall Street Journal, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2310.16s)]
*  which if you're an economist is kind of your house newspaper, but it's definitely a great [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2316.08s)]
*  place to keep track of what the wealthier thinking and doing. I mentioned that today, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2320.64s)]
*  very wealthy people to our middle class eyes, it looks like they're just wearing normal clothes, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2326.3199999999997s)]
*  boring pants, boring sweater, loafers or whatever. If you look at these brands, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2333.04s)]
*  they're stratospherically expensive, but they're very low key, fine material or imported, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2338.8s)]
*  expensively sourced items. So to most people, you look like maybe you're just some executive [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2345.04s)]
*  or some retired grandparent or something like that. But you're wearing an outfit that even though [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2350.5600000000004s)]
*  it is boring, Wagner is correct, the outfit may still cost a couple thousand dollars, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2355.36s)]
*  because all the items are so low key, very expensive. So it seems like it's more about, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2360.2400000000002s)]
*  I would say it's about refining the signal that's being sent. In the old days with top hats and [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2366.48s)]
*  opera glasses and so forth, it's about being conspicuous in your consumption to everybody. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2372.08s)]
*  Whereas now it's more about signaling to other wealthy people or people adjacent to that. Like, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2378.48s)]
*  oh, he looks normal, but he's wearing that very, very expensive shirt. That's a $400 tailored shirt. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2384.32s)]
*  It's more subtle signaling now that doesn't necessarily land to the middle class eye [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2390.4s)]
*  the way it does for the ruling class. So I think part of the legacy of the New Deal is now the rich, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2395.44s)]
*  as Paul Fusel put it, have been driven underground in exactly how their outward [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2400.16s)]
*  class affectations manifest. Except for watches, which you point out. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2405.04s)]
*  Yeah, watches. And it's usually the toys now that we see the consumption more than attire. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2410.32s)]
*  And it would definitely include the watches. My God, the money that people invest in their simple [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2415.28s)]
*  timepiece is incredible. But then you get to people's yachts and cars and as you said, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2420.4s)]
*  private jets. And now we're done with the affecting a down to earth persona. And I think too, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2425.04s)]
*  we were talking about Thorstein Veblen before we started recording the great Norwegian-American [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2431.84s)]
*  sociologist who coined the term conspicuous consumption. And one of his points, which I [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2438.0s)]
*  liked so much that I think I included it in the text as well, is exactly what you said. It's not [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2443.2000000000003s)]
*  just that you have a life of leisure because of all your wealth, but you have so much wealth to [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2447.92s)]
*  show off, so much wealth to conspicuously consume, that you'll have staff who also do nothing. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2453.04s)]
*  In the old days, that would be your senior butler or your hall boys and so on who generally aren't [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2460.08s)]
*  doing anything, but I can pay them just to stand there in case later I want a glass of tea or [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2465.76s)]
*  something. So extending your conspicuous consumption leisure lifestyle to some of your staff, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2471.6s)]
*  this is the way conspicuous consumption works. It's not just look at my flashy sports car, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2478.3199999999997s)]
*  it's these weird layers and who's signaling to whom. Well, this is Veblen's theory of the leisure [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2483.2799999999997s)]
*  class, which is an important book along with C. Wright Mills, the power elite. They're older books, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2489.04s)]
*  but they certainly get the pathology of the ruling class. C. Wright Mills makes a point which [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2495.84s)]
*  kind of coalesces with my own experience among the super rich, and that is that the way they [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2502.8s)]
*  signal to each other is always subtle. If you're not initiated into that club, you can't read it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2508.0s)]
*  It's not just about brands, but it's about which ski area in Switzerland you [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2518.2400000000002s)]
*  ski in. That's a concrete example I'm using. One of my friends, his father, Scranton, was the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2523.1200000000003s)]
*  governor of Pennsylvania, came from an oligarchic family. I remember visiting the mansion. It was [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2531.36s)]
*  the first time I ever saw an Olympic indoor pool in a house, and his father came back from work in [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2536.2400000000002s)]
*  a helicopter. It is a world in and of itself. I once had dinner in New York with a very wealthy [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2541.6800000000003s)]
*  friend of mine. He invited me to dinner and gave me the address, and I went to a building in Midtown [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2553.2000000000003s)]
*  and got on the elevator and took it to the top floor, and it was oak panel doors. There was no [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2561.6000000000004s)]
*  sign. There was nothing. You would never know it's there, and it was a very exclusive dining [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2566.8s)]
*  residence. Al Sharpton, I want to add, was at the table next to us. There were no checks. Every [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2573.76s)]
*  waitress looked like she was a fashion model. You could smoke cigars. It gets back to this world of [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2579.04s)]
*  Richistan. They don't live in the world we live in, and yet when they have, they live in a non-reality [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2586.24s)]
*  environment, really. It's kind of fantasy land, and yet when you give them an oligarchic elite, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2592.64s)]
*  this is just true throughout history, when you give them that kind of power, then they just start [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2597.92s)]
*  destroying everything around them because they have no ability to judge reality because they [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2603.68s)]
*  don't live in reality. Indeed. That absolutely is the case. I mean, there's a lot to say about this, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2612.3999999999996s)]
*  but every time I get onto this subject, I always think of, you may remember, and some of your [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2619.44s)]
*  viewers may remember, there's a famous photo of, I think, then Senator or perhaps State Secretary, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2625.68s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, I think, campaigning, and she's in the home of a working-class person, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2631.12s)]
*  and it's just a famous photo of her standing in the entrance to a kitchen, like a working-class [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2637.04s)]
*  person's kitchen, and it's not, I mean, we've seen tiny apartments. It's not tiny. It's not dirty. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2641.8399999999997s)]
*  It has a couple plants that have been watered and are draining in the sink basin. The look on her [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2648.08s)]
*  face is amazing. It's the look of the face of someone who's seeing a homeless person for the [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2653.04s)]
*  first time. I think it's just a little telling moment that got captured, but what I talk about [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2658.4s)]
*  in the book is how one natural process of markets is to produce class segregation. You can't afford [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2663.84s)]
*  to live in this neighborhood. Maybe you'd like the dingy, dangerous, or environmentally unhealthy [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2670.88s)]
*  neighborhood on the other side of town, or sometimes literally on the other side of the tracks. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2676.32s)]
*  I'm going to have a little discussion of that in the book about how that segregation works. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2681.44s)]
*  I would just say, as I did for this book, if you read marketing for wealthy households, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2685.28s)]
*  product pitches that aren't towards some mass market of most people, but the very high end of [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2692.5600000000004s)]
*  markets, there is no word that they use more than exclusive. It's an exclusive venue with exclusive [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2698.1600000000003s)]
*  products and exclusive service, and it's fascinating because in society, so many of us and so many [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2705.92s)]
*  institutions are striving for inclusion to include historically marginalized groups and identities, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2712.0s)]
*  which I think is great, but the whole economy is built around catering to people who want [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2717.28s)]
*  exclusion. I want to exclude all you grubby peasants from my lovely private dining environment or my [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2722.64s)]
*  private resort or whatever it is. That exclusion, it's class-based. Today's ruling class, as we're [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2729.04s)]
*  saying, is fairly cosmopolitan. Of course, you still have your rich, prejudiced wasps and some [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2736.56s)]
*  buttoned-up Hamptons, country clubs, and so on, but these days, people who are elite pride [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2741.9199999999996s)]
*  themselves on being accepting and having friends from around the world of different types, as long [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2748.7999999999997s)]
*  as they're people of means. If you're some poor person who cares what kind of person you are, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2754.16s)]
*  you're fit to scrub my floors for a small check, but that segregation is a really big piece of it, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2759.7599999999998s)]
*  and there are places in the world, especially large cities, where you can just visibly observe [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2764.7999999999997s)]
*  where the class segregation line is drawn. Sometimes it's the wall of a gated community, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2770.24s)]
*  sometimes it's just one of those streets where you have high rises on one side and then [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2775.2799999999997s)]
*  what you could characterize as slums on the other side of the boulevard. Fascinating stuff, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2779.68s)]
*  but yes, the effect of all of it is to make these people just abjectly disconnected from people's [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2785.04s)]
*  everyday experience. Let's talk about where we're going. Aristotle writes that when oligarchs [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2790.4799999999996s)]
*  seize control, the only two options are tyranny or revolution. Indeed, I would definitely go along [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2799.68s)]
*  with Aristotle's wisdom there, and there's a lot to say about it. Obviously, this last election [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2807.9199999999996s)]
*  is fairly demoralizing. A lot of avoidable things led to that from Biden insisting he could run [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2813.2799999999997s)]
*  again despite being a walking corpse. Therefore, we don't have a primary. Sir, we're stuck with [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2820.24s)]
*  Harris, who's one of the weakest candidates to ever run for any office, certainly including the [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2825.3599999999997s)]
*  White House. Wait, let me- Rob, do you think the Democratic Party is reformable? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2829.2s)]
*  Oh, that's a really good question. I don't. I feel like I would have said that in the 20s, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2835.3599999999997s)]
*  too, though, and we did get a New Deal Great Society era, not because of anything within the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2841.4399999999996s)]
*  party, of course, but because of waves of sit-down strikes and the depression by the CIO that [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2846.7999999999997s)]
*  terrorized the rich and their backers. You could make a pretty good case they're unreformable by [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2851.68s)]
*  this time. I'm not a political scientist. I think it's time. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2856.08s)]
*  The liberal class, and I wrote a book called Death of the Liberal Class. The liberal class [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2860.56s)]
*  is a completely different animal in the wake of the Cold War. They're not the traditional liberal [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2864.7999999999997s)]
*  class. They're not the FDR oligarchic liberal. Those people don't exist anymore, and part of [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2869.68s)]
*  the failure on the part of the capitalist ruling elite is that they destroyed the liberal class, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2876.7999999999997s)]
*  which, as Noam Chomsky points out, functioned as a safety valve. It ameliorated the excesses of [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2881.84s)]
*  capitalism, and by destroying that liberal mechanism, we ended up where we are. In a [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  functioning democracy that wasn't ruled by corporate power, Bernie Sanders would have [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2898.1600000000003s)]
*  been the nominee without question because the power of a Pelosi or a Clinton or a Schumer is [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2903.84s)]
*  money. It's the fact that they are the conduit for oligarchic money, and they anoint the [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2911.2s)]
*  candidates they want, and they destroy the candidates that they don't want. I think [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2917.7599999999998s)]
*  Bernie would have crushed Trump. I think anybody advocating New Deal reforms would have buried [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2923.04s)]
*  Trump. I just throw that out. I mean, you can respond, but I don't see the Democratic Party [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2928.16s)]
*  as reformable. Yeah, I would say they're going wall to wall to stop Sanders. Does show. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2934.08s)]
*  I would say that's a strong argument for your case. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2940.7200000000003s)]
*  But Rob, Lloyd Blankfein was very open about it. He said that if Sanders was the nominee, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2943.52s)]
*  they would support Trump. You'd end up with a 1972 kind of situation when McGovern won, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2948.7200000000003s)]
*  and the hierarchy, the donor, and the class, and the political establishment within the Democratic [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2955.52s)]
*  Party all backed Nixon and destroyed McGovern. Blankfein was very open about what would happen. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2961.44s)]
*  Indeed. I think the writing was on the wall before he even outwardly, absolutely explicitly [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2968.72s)]
*  said it. And that is Blankfein. He really is. Well, of course, we'll do this evil thing to stop [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2974.24s)]
*  health insurance for poor people. My God. It absolutely, of course, is the case that [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2980.08s)]
*  Sanders would have walked over Trump. I mean, this is why figures like Clinton and Biden, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2984.88s)]
*  despite being ludicrously weak political figures and unpopular and poor campaigners, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2990.48s)]
*  they were still chosen to be the party nominees. They weren't people who could beat Trump. They [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2996.0s)]
*  were people who could beat Sanders. The big concern is to block out social democracy and [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=2998.96s)]
*  the independence that would give some workers and the tax burden it would impose on the rich, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3003.84s)]
*  even though they're unlikely to notice much of it. It absolutely is the case. And I would say if 2016, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3008.5600000000004s)]
*  and really especially 2020, showed us anything, it absolutely is that the ruling class would [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3013.84s)]
*  absolutely prefer a liberal norm breaking authoritarian to some awful social Democrat. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3019.52s)]
*  And it is impressive. I just want to throw out, I mean, certainly from your political standpoint [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3027.2s)]
*  in mind, Sanders was hardly a flaming radical. He was kind of an RFK kind of liberal. We're not [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3032.24s)]
*  talking about Rosa Luxemburg here. Absolutely. And as a lot of my left wing friends said at the time, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3038.72s)]
*  Bernie is the compromise. That's already significantly more to the right than we want. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3045.12s)]
*  He's basically a European social Democrat, give or take. And in America, that's just a stunning [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3049.6s)]
*  departure from the norm. And suddenly he's scooping up all this support from across [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3055.3599999999997s)]
*  political groups that are thought to be antagonized with our weird castrated identity and economic [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3060.0s)]
*  bracket based horse race sort of political landscape. But to your main point though, I think [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3066.24s)]
*  that comment on liberalism is exactly right. And what I tend to think of on that subject was, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3072.7200000000003s)]
*  I won't be able to remember the quote. It was something that, again, Chomsky often liked to [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3079.2000000000003s)]
*  bring up from the old anarchist socialist, Rudolf Rocker, who said words to the effect of that the [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3082.8s)]
*  promise of liberalism and the liberal revolutions was broken on the rocks of capitalism. I think [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3090.1600000000003s)]
*  that that's pretty accurate. The ruling class likes liberalism and pluralism and a participatory [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3097.12s)]
*  process right up to the point that inconveniences that base of wealth that the donor class stands [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3103.8399999999997s)]
*  on and that controls everything in the Democratic Party. So, reformable or not. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3110.3199999999997s)]
*  Liberals throughout history have proven that point. It was Ebert and the socialist in Germany [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3115.68s)]
*  organized the Freikorps, crushed the revolutionary movements in Germany. Let's just finish briefly, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3122.24s)]
*  because you end the book with this. You define yourself as a socialist, I define myself as a [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3127.68s)]
*  socialist. Okay, let's quote Lenin, who Chomsky describes as counter-revolutionary. What must be [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3133.2s)]
*  done? Well, in my view, obviously, it centers on economic issues as it would. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3142.72s)]
*  But to me, the political situation in the United States is such a perennial disaster because of [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3151.8399999999997s)]
*  the structures that prevent us from having a labor-based or a socialist political party. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3157.8399999999997s)]
*  You get stuck with various levels of right-wing conservative capitalist parties. So, to me, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3162.96s)]
*  right now, I feel like the best action we can be taking going forward immediately is through [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3169.04s)]
*  other avenues. Not to say we should turn our back on national-level politics, but I would say, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3174.7999999999997s)]
*  right now, the real promise is in the resurgence in the labor movement and gradually in socialist [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3180.08s)]
*  political representation too. I wouldn't call it a labor comeback yet, but it's at least a renaissance. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3185.68s)]
*  We have several hundred organized Starbucks stores. Most of them are still waiting on contracts, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3192.64s)]
*  or I think several of them are now in negotiations. But that's something no one would have anticipated [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3197.2s)]
*  just five or six years ago. We have at least that one organized Staten Island Amazon warehouse, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3202.96s)]
*  the JFK8 facility, which has some amazing people there. Modest but real UAW organizing [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3209.6s)]
*  victories in the South. Impressive negotiations and contracts being brought in by some of the [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3215.8399999999997s)]
*  other major national locals. And of course, we're facing this new ugly administration. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3221.52s)]
*  But having that organizing happening, I think, is just about the healthiest thing that could [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3227.12s)]
*  happen in the United States. Our labor density is still beaten down into the single digits [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3230.88s)]
*  nationally, but it was lower than that in 1910. And then we had the huge CIO resurgence that took [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3235.92s)]
*  a lot of sacrifice and real work from people. And it's a different country now. It's a century [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3242.7200000000003s)]
*  later. It's a lot richer. It's a lot lazier. There's a lot of social platforms that make it easy to talk [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3247.84s)]
*  about stuff and never do anything. That's popular. But to me, working through this labor movement is [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3254.16s)]
*  the way to, I think, immediately move forward. And I'm very lucky to be part of my... I'm in the AFT [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3259.2000000000003s)]
*  and I'm our county labor council rep. And I would just say this to people, especially these days, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3266.32s)]
*  people are feeling very bummed out, bad vibes after this last election, understandably. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3273.2000000000003s)]
*  And I would say the cure for bad vibes is to be in some actual group that you actually physically [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3279.0400000000004s)]
*  meet in person and talk to and do some action with. Even if this is just a small Gaza demonstration [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3284.96s)]
*  you do on the street or a little union affinity group, or you're hoping in time to get an [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3291.68s)]
*  organization into your workplace, just meeting with people and actually engaging, you will be amazed [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3297.12s)]
*  what that does for your serotonin levels and for the furtherance of moving a socialist project [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3302.16s)]
*  forward. It comes from being social. And I think especially after COVID, we have more people who [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3307.68s)]
*  are, as they sometimes say, anti-social socialists. But I think a great cure for that goes through the [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3313.68s)]
*  same road that the movement needs, which is us actually getting together and trying to organize [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3320.16s)]
*  in a real way to get some labor strength in this country and to get some national, some nationwide [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3325.3599999999997s)]
*  left-wing political representation. And Sanders is the obvious figure here, but I think we should [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3331.92s)]
*  appreciate, despite it being such a modest achievement, just having any socialist congressional [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3338.24s)]
*  representatives, and at the state level as well, which people never pay attention to, but it's so [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ-OSJ7J64w&t=3343.52s)]
