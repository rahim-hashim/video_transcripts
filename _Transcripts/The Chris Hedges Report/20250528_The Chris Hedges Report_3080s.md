# The Shared Mythological History of Israel and the US (w/ Joan Scott) | The Chris Hedges Report
**The Chris Hedges Report:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ)
*  Amy Kaplan's Our American Israel, the story of an entangled alliance, dissects Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=0.0s)]
*  symbiotic relationship with the United States. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=16.0s)]
*  She tells the story of how a Jewish settler colonial project captured the imagination [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  of the American public, intertwining Israel's national myth with our own. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=24.02s)]
*  American exceptionalism mirrors Israeli exceptionalism. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=29.44s)]
*  The belief that America ordained by God to lead the world replicates Israel's messianic [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=33.44s)]
*  vision of itself. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=39.24s)]
*  The two countries, because of their similar national myths, insist they are exempt from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=40.74s)]
*  international humanitarian law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=46.96s)]
*  They share an open disdain for the quote unquote lesser breeds of the earth, each tracing their [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  roots to European colonialism. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=55.56s)]
*  Israeli Jews, Kaplan writes, are at once eternal victims and lionized for their military prowess. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=58.4s)]
*  Palestinians in the process have been at best rendered invisible and often demonized as [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=65.24s)]
*  sub-humans. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Representations of the barbarians the United States and Israel seek to suppress in their [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=71.56s)]
*  clash of civilizations. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=77.8s)]
*  What makes Kaplan's book unique is that she is a cultural critic, seen in the myths and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=80.08s)]
*  stories disseminated by writers, filmmakers, artists, and journalists, the enforcement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=85.04s)]
*  of the peculiar beliefs that sustain the bond between the Zionist state and Washington. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=90.4s)]
*  She opens the book with a dissection of Leon Eurus's novel Exodus, as well as his film [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=96.92s)]
*  adaptation, which shaped a generation's understanding of Israel in the Middle East. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=102.0s)]
*  She probes Joan Peter's 1984 book From Time Immemorial, which was the template used by [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=107.2s)]
*  pro-Israeli historians to argue falsely that the Palestinians never existed as a distinct [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=114.6s)]
*  people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel's myth, she notes, is protean, depending on the shifting historical realities. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, for example, and the massacres in the Sabra and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=126.24s)]
*  Shatila Palestinian refugee camps, the Palestinian uprisings or intifadas required new narratives [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=131.72s)]
*  to buttress the Israeli-American ties. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=138.36s)]
*  Suddenly, the Holocaust, which was a footnote at the beginning in the popular narrative, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  assumed central importance. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=146.12s)]
*  Israel, especially with the establishment of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, was [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=147.92s)]
*  intertwined with the Shoah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=153.16s)]
*  The genocide became central to Jewish identity, and playing the card that it could happen [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=155.2s)]
*  again, Israel was given a license to engage in savage repression of the Palestinians, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=161.16s)]
*  dismissed by Israeli leaders as the new Nazis. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=167.76s)]
*  Kaplan ends the book by chronicling the rise of Christian Zionism, which has emerged as [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=171.44s)]
*  a bulwark of support for the apartheid state of Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=176.48s)]
*  Kaplan, who died in 2020, was the Edward W. Kane Professor of English at the University [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=179.92s)]
*  of Pennsylvania. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=185.92s)]
*  Her book has recently been reissued by Harvard University Press. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=186.92s)]
*  Joining me to discuss Kaplan's book is Professor Joan Scott, Professor Emerita in the School [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=191.32s)]
*  of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, an adjunct professor of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=197.36s)]
*  history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=202.68s)]
*  Her many books include the classic Gender and the Politics of History, the Politics [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=207.0s)]
*  of the Veil, and Knowledge, Power, and Academic Freedom. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=212.5s)]
*  Let's begin with Kaplan. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=216.8s)]
*  I've read many, many, many books on the Middle East. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  I've spent seven years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  I did find this book unique in the way that it approached the subject matter. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=222.4s)]
*  As I mentioned to you when we spoke, it reminded me of Gramsci's understanding of cultural [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=228.52s)]
*  hegemony, how culture essentially creates a narrative that buttresses policy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  Just talk a little bit about her, and then we'll go into the book. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=242.68s)]
*  Well, I met her. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=248.28s)]
*  I just have to say, Chris, your summary of the book was just terrific, enviable, because [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=249.96s)]
*  it could be a kind of review that should be everywhere so that people would know what [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=257.56s)]
*  is in this book. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=262.24s)]
*  I thought you summarized it really, really well. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=263.24s)]
*  She was, as you said, a professor of English and American Studies at Penn. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=267.2s)]
*  She was here at the Institute. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=272.16s)]
*  People come to the Institute to do research and writing for a year. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=273.62s)]
*  She had a fellowship at the Institute in 2011-12 when she started this book. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  She was just digging around to kind of, as an American Studies person, she was interested [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  in just what you put your finger on, and the cultural stuff that produced this special [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=289.26s)]
*  relationship, the untouchable special relationship between the United States and Israel. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=295.46s)]
*  She worked away at it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=302.74s)]
*  She gave a seminar here, which was that first chapter of the book on Exodus. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  Those of us who grew up in the 50s and early 60s, I think the novel was 57 and the film [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=309.82s)]
*  was 1960. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  With Paul Newman, blonde and blue-eyed is the ... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=316.82s)]
*  Blonde and blue-eyed as the embodiment of Jewish ... [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  The archetypal Jew. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  No, it was really ... She did it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  She did it as a seminar here, and her reading of it was just terrific. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=328.08s)]
*  People were just astonished. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=332.4s)]
*  Those of us, as I said, who had grown up knowing how popular that film had been, were really [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=333.73999999999995s)]
*  taken aback at how astute she was in her readings of the ways in which a certain stereotypical [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  image of the feeble, victimized Jew is replaced by the Paul Newman figure who was a heroic [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=348.5s)]
*  fighter for the future of Israel and the future of the Jewish people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=354.62s)]
*  She worked hard on that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=361.32s)]
*  Then it took her a while. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=362.56s)]
*  The book was published finally in 2018. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=365.12s)]
*  I remember reading many chapters of it as she was producing them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=367.56s)]
*  Then she was tragically diagnosed with brain cancer and died two years later in 2020 so [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=373.0s)]
*  that she never got to publicize the book the way one usually does, giving talks all over [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  the place, having discussion sessions of the kind where she would respond to critics [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=387.0s)]
*  and so on. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=394.62s)]
*  Then a year or so ago, her daughter, her adult daughter now, in the wake of all of the discussion [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=396.54s)]
*  going on about Gaza and the genocidal war in Gaza, thought that this would be a time [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=407.98s)]
*  when this book would weigh in in a way that no other book does on the question of Israel-Palestine. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=413.02s)]
*  She started a campaign with Harvard University Press and convinced them to publish it, to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=420.46s)]
*  issue it in paperback. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=425.86s)]
*  It was already published. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=427.42s)]
*  They issued the paperback as of March 1st, I think. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=428.94s)]
*  Many of us who were committed to Amy's memory and to the book decided that we would go to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=432.74s)]
*  our local bookstores and promote it and talk about it, which is how you and I first discussed [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  the book at the bookstore in Labyrinth Bookstore in Princeton. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=445.4s)]
*  That's the story of it. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=450.52s)]
*  I think rereading it for our discussions, I was struck once again with how much insight [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=451.76s)]
*  it provides into this so-called special relationship. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  We should say, first of all, Rashid Khalili, the great Palestinian scholar, gave it a glowing [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=463.28s)]
*  review in the nation when it came out. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=468.67999999999995s)]
*  She herself, I know this only from you, had come out of a Zionist background. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=475.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=482.11999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=483.11999999999995s)]
*  That was part of what this was about, I think, was exploring where she had come from and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=484.11999999999995s)]
*  what this indoctrination had been as she was growing up herself. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  In fact, in the acknowledgments, she mentions the fact, I think her father died before the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=496.0s)]
*  book was published, but she says he would have disagreed with everything I was doing [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  here, but he would have acknowledged my right to do it, something like that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=505.08s)]
*  You get even in that small acknowledgement a sense that she's coming from a place which [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=512.48s)]
*  she had to interrogate critically in a very deep way, and she did. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=519.0s)]
*  She would come in at lunch, we all have lunch together, the people who are fellows at the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=523.68s)]
*  institute, and she'd come in and she'd say, I can't believe it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=529.52s)]
*  I.F. Stone and the nation were great supporters of Israel in the 40s. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  This was very depressing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=537.24s)]
*  Well, for those of us for whom I.F. Stone was the hero, the journalist hero during the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=538.24s)]
*  Vietnam War, this was like, how could this be? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=545.64s)]
*  He recanted, he in fact changed his mind quite significantly on this question, but in the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=548.36s)]
*  40s, he was absolutely on board for the land with no people for a people with no land. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  That was Joan Peters, who she takes down. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, one has to admire her deep, obvious, what comes through with the book, intellectual, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=565.0s)]
*  not just profundity, but integrity, clearly. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=571.68s)]
*  Just broadly, there are two templates that are used to bond Israel and the United States. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=578.2399999999999s)]
*  The first is the mythic version of the settling of the West, and the second is the Bible. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=585.0s)]
*  Just broadly, can you talk about that? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=591.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  He has a quote in the title of the book, Our American Israel, comes from a 1799 sermon [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=595.08s)]
*  preached in a New England church, which says something like, America is the realization [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=601.9200000000001s)]
*  of the biblical Israel. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=608.84s)]
*  We're here. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=610.44s)]
*  I think it's on page, as I remember, it's page five. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  The phrase, Our American Israel, comes from a Puritan expression of colonial American [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=617.2s)]
*  exceptionalism. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=621.0s)]
*  His quote was this sermon, traits of the resemblance in the people of the United States of America [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=622.92s)]
*  to ancient Israel. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=629.04s)]
*  It has often been remarked, the guy says, that the people of the United States come [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=631.08s)]
*  nearer to a parallel with ancient Israel than any other nation upon the globe. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=635.12s)]
*  Hence, Our American Israel, a term frequently used and common consent allows it apt and [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=639.84s)]
*  proper. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=645.2s)]
*  So the biblical Israel is there from the 18th century on and gets recovered again [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=646.2s)]
*  in new form by the evangelicals you mentioned. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=655.5200000000001s)]
*  The last couple of chapters, or the next to last chapter of the book, deals with the way [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=659.2s)]
*  in which American evangelicals pick up this notion, this time, that the second coming [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=663.1600000000001s)]
*  of Christ will come in Israel somehow. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=670.0s)]
*  And at that moment, those Jews who convert will be raptured up along with the Christians [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=673.6s)]
*  and everyone else will be destroyed in another apocalyptic moment of biblical transformation. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=679.52s)]
*  So the biblical theme runs through from the beginning when America is the realization [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=690.64s)]
*  of the dream of Israel to the 20th century, or even the 21st century, when Israel is the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=696.48s)]
*  fulfillment of the prophecies of the Bible. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=705.24s)]
*  And the same biblical passages, the Puritans were using the stories of the Amalekites, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=709.88s)]
*  you know, which Netanyahu has repeated about decimating, destroying, I think even their [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=715.36s)]
*  children and animals and everything else, they were using exactly the same biblical [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=720.08s)]
*  passage to justify the genocide against Native Americans. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=723.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  And she develops that really nicely too, the Native American parallel and the Palestinian [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=728.88s)]
*  parallels, which in fact echo that theme of a land with no people for a people with no [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=736.6s)]
*  land. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=743.5600000000001s)]
*  It's the same argument made here. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  There's no one here when the Americans came and they wipe out or tried to wipe out the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=745.5600000000001s)]
*  Native Americans similarly with Palestinians. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=751.04s)]
*  Well and this was pushed by the 1984 book by John Peters, which was taken down when [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=755.24s)]
*  he was a graduate student by Norman Finkelstein, which argued that they had no national identity, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=761.7199999999999s)]
*  the Palestinians had no national identity, that those Palestinians who were there had [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=767.18s)]
*  actually migrated because the Jewish colonists were reinvigorating, I mean all of which was [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=771.96s)]
*  false. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=781.4000000000001s)]
*  And she deals with the importance of the Peters book because it was used by pro-Israeli historians [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=784.2800000000001s)]
*  for a long time to justify this very false narrative. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=789.88s)]
*  I want to start with, as she does, you mentioned I.F. Stone, his book, Underground to Palestine, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=794.0s)]
*  but I found that this, on the one hand you had the left, I.F. Stone being part of the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=800.2s)]
*  counterculture, but this identification of the counterculture with this settler colonial [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=806.36s)]
*  state. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=813.44s)]
*  And as you said, I.F. Stone recants. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=815.84s)]
*  I'm just going to read that little passage. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=819.96s)]
*  His book, Underground to Palestine, his first book, Stone's book included the major tropes [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=823.0400000000001s)]
*  of the narrative that progressive Americans told about Zionism in the years following [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=829.5s)]
*  World War II. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=834.62s)]
*  His personal discovery of kinship with the Jews of Europe added poignancy. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=836.04s)]
*  He realized that if his parents hadn't emigrated from Russia to America, he might have gone [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=840.52s)]
*  to the gas chambers or ended up a ragged, quote unquote, and homeless refugee. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=845.16s)]
*  As he drew closer to his Jewish brothers, he recorded their plaintive Yiddish songs, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=849.94s)]
*  which expressed longing for a world lost to catastrophic violence. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=854.88s)]
*  At the same time, he narrated their journey in resolutely American tones. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=859.5s)]
*  That's a fundamental theme of the book, as a story of rebirth in the transformative voyage [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=863.98s)]
*  from the old world to the new. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=869.32s)]
*  In contrast to the defeatist spirit hovering over a shattered Europe, he was amazed by [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=871.36s)]
*  the tremendous vitality of the refugees and by their determination to build a new life [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=876.38s)]
*  in a new land. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=881.92s)]
*  In his book, Stone focused on the journey, not the arrival, chronically in the dream [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=883.14s)]
*  of a Jewish homeland, uncluttered by Arab realities that disrupted these dreams, realities [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=887.9s)]
*  that he had noted in his earlier reports from Palestine. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=894.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about that link between the left and Stone was himself persecuted, blacklisted. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=896.8s)]
*  He couldn't even get a job at the nation. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=904.26s)]
*  He ends up printing IF Stones weekly in his basement, as you said, not only about the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=905.76s)]
*  Vietnam War, but about the Korean War, exposing many atrocities in the Korean War. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=911.72s)]
*  But there was this marriage, and then we'll go in and talk about Exodus, the book, and [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=915.8000000000001s)]
*  the movie. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=920.76s)]
*  And I find that coupling kind of fascinating. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=922.6s)]
*  One of the things I think was the attraction on the left to the socialist vision of Israel, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  the kibbutz, which how many books were written about that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=933.76s)]
*  This was the future possibility, not only for leftists, but for feminists. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=938.8s)]
*  You had collective child rearing, collective meal preparation, all of the kind of domestic [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=944.4399999999999s)]
*  tasks that were thought to be oppressive for women are shared in a different kind of arrangement. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=950.26s)]
*  So I think that was one thing, and certainly that attracted him as well as Frieda Kirschwee [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=958.4s)]
*  at the nation and others. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=964.64s)]
*  This was a kind of socialist experiment that was very attractive and very possible. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  The other was the notion, and she uses this term several times in the course of the book, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=973.96s)]
*  of the invincible victims. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=981.88s)]
*  That is, on the one hand, Jews had been victims of horrific treatment in Europe and historically [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=984.36s)]
*  victims of anti-Semitism of all kinds, but here they were invincible. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  That is, they were going to prevail. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=999.36s)]
*  There was a kind of resilience that could be admired rather than the kind of awful notion [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1001.72s)]
*  of victimization. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1009.02s)]
*  The notion of resistance is important to the left as well. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1011.28s)]
*  The Warsaw Ghetto becomes a kind of proof that the uprising of the Warsaw Ghetto becomes [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1015.4399999999999s)]
*  a proof of the fact that Jews are resistant. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1021.0s)]
*  They're not just pathetic victims. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1024.16s)]
*  They're, as she calls them again, invincible victims. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1026.3600000000001s)]
*  That is, whatever happens, there's a kind of resilience and resistance that prevails [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1029.52s)]
*  and that Israel then becomes the embodiment for many people on the left as a result of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  that, I think. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1040.88s)]
*  Well, she talks later about the importance of the Holocaust, but it's important to note [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1041.88s)]
*  that initially with the establishment of the State of Israel, those refugees from Europe, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1045.8200000000002s)]
*  the victims of the Holocaust were considered somewhat shameful for not having resisted. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1051.3999999999999s)]
*  It was only later that the Holocaust became part of Jewish identity and a trope, but not [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1057.44s)]
*  initially, not at first. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1064.16s)]
*  Of course, as you well know, the irony of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is that the only [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1066.36s)]
*  commander, deputy commander of the uprising, Marek Edelman, condemned the apartheid state, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1071.3999999999999s)]
*  the settler colonial state, recognized Palestinians' right to self-determination and resistance, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1079.2s)]
*  even armed resistance, drawing analogies between his resistance, the resistance he and the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1086.52s)]
*  ghetto fighters carried out in Warsaw, and the resistance in Palestine. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1091.5600000000002s)]
*  On the one hand, yes, they used the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, but the only major historical [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1096.48s)]
*  figure was an anathema, was a pariah in Israel itself. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1103.4s)]
*  Well, one of the things, just you're mentioning that, one of the things she tracks really [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1107.4s)]
*  nicely is the way in which there is always a dissenting voice like his, like others even [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1112.68s)]
*  when she talks about the history of the founding of the State of Israel. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1120.0400000000002s)]
*  There were many people, Hannah Arendt, Martin Buber, who thought that the idea of a Jewish [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1123.24s)]
*  homeland, a Jewish state, was a dangerous ethno-national way of thinking about a place, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1131.2s)]
*  a homeland or a place where Jews could come. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1141.24s)]
*  But what she shows so clearly is how carefully and ruthlessly those positions were eclipsed. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1147.16s)]
*  Those voices were, if not silenced, were just so muted that they couldn't be heard. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1154.5600000000002s)]
*  Your notion of Gramsci, I think, is right. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1161.96s)]
*  This hegemonic vision, cultural sort of appreciation of the importance of Israel for America prevails [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  every time. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1172.28s)]
*  There are places in chapters where you think, oh, good, there's some criticism being articulated [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1174.76s)]
*  here, and she goes into it at some length. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1181.8400000000001s)]
*  And then you just watch it being slapped down by the major forces of the media, by politicians, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1183.96s)]
*  and by what becomes defined as the Israel lobby or the lobbyists who are going to, the [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  Anti-Defamation League and what becomes AIPAC. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1199.44s)]
*  Those groups acquire a predominance that manages to silence any kind of criticism. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1203.64s)]
*  Well, Yeshiashu Leibowitz, we should mention, another great Israeli philosopher who saw [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1211.64s)]
*  it all coming where we are. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1218.0s)]
*  I also want to talk about journalists because she got it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1221.6000000000001s)]
*  There's two things, having spent 20 years overseas, I found with people, especially [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1226.6000000000001s)]
*  people who parachuted in, because they really didn't understand the situation around them. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1233.24s)]
*  They immediately deformed the situation to make it palatable for an American audience, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1238.46s)]
*  but to Americanize it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1244.78s)]
*  And so there's, she talks immediately after, of course, 750,000 Palestinians are dispossessed. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1249.78s)]
*  Jaffa was largely a Palestinian city, completely emptied, and ethnic cleansing, thousands were [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1256.78s)]
*  killed, the Dariusine massacre. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1264.78s)]
*  And then you have the journalists who come from the United States and they report about [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1267.98s)]
*  it and they can't even see what's in front of their eyes. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1272.1s)]
*  There's this passage she's writing about, Frieda Kirshwe, who visited the silent, quote [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1277.3799999999999s)]
*  unquote silent and deserted city of Jaffa to address the question, why did the Arabs [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1284.58s)]
*  run? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1291.1s)]
*  She registered the momentousness of more than 50,000 people fleeing from Palestine's largest [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1291.86s)]
*  Arab city. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1298.2199999999998s)]
*  And she briefly noted the attack and siege by the combined forces of the Aragon, this [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1299.58s)]
*  was underground terrorist group led by Begin, right? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1304.26s)]
*  And the Haganah, which was the more established Israeli militia army at the end of April. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1308.06s)]
*  Yet she did not mention the impact of this attack on the population. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1315.8999999999999s)]
*  Instead she claimed that the mass flight from Jaffa and from other Palestinian cities [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1320.22s)]
*  and villages seemed to have little to do with the fighting itself. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1324.26s)]
*  At stake, this is going on at the bottom of the paragraph, at stake for Kirshwe and the [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1330.46s)]
*  image of the humane soldier was her investment in the Jewish refugee as a universal symbol [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1335.42s)]
*  of noble suffering and the creation of the Jewish state as a moral triumph for civilization [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1341.98s)]
*  over fascism. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1347.9s)]
*  I saw that every war, every place I ever covered, I fought it, but I had to fight not only the [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1349.54s)]
*  mythic narrative that was being peddled to the American public, but my own colleagues [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1356.98s)]
*  in the press. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1361.98s)]
*  Because I was with the New York Times, I didn't come and go, I lived there. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1363.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I was six years in Latin America, seven years in the Middle East. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1366.74s)]
*  But these people who parachuted in, who didn't have any linguistic facility and didn't have [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1370.18s)]
*  any historical knowledge, immediately fed the kind of tropes that Americans can understand [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1376.22s)]
*  and that allowed them to make sense of what they didn't understand. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1384.98s)]
*  She gets that really, really well in the book. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1388.54s)]
*  Well, I also think that it comes also from the notion that some of these journalists [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1391.54s)]
*  think they have to feed, what you said a minute ago, they have to feed the information in [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1399.54s)]
*  terms that their readers can already understand rather than understanding their role as producing [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1405.94s)]
*  knowledge that people then have to deal with. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1414.58s)]
*  And you see that now dramatically in journalism covering the Gaza war. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1418.74s)]
*  It's the fear that they will offend readers is far greater than the notion that their [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1426.74s)]
*  job is to communicate to readers information that might not be comfortable, but that they [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1436.82s)]
*  need to really know. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1442.46s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1444.46s)]
*  She shows you very, with very fine-tuned analysis. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1445.66s)]
*  Yeah, well, very clear examples. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1449.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1452.78s)]
*  But I think that's what we're living with now. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1454.86s)]
*  Of course. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1457.62s)]
*  Doesn't the New York Times have a list of words you're not allowed to use? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1458.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, when they talk about the student encampments, they characterize them as they [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1461.1399999999999s)]
*  harass Jewish students. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1466.02s)]
*  Jewish students may have been harassed, but the bulk of the repression was carried out [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1467.86s)]
*  against the protesters, a hundred of whom were arrested on the campus of Columbia, people [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1471.26s)]
*  who've been deported, people who've been suspended, Ruha Benjamin at Princeton is teaching under [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1477.1799999999998s)]
*  probation. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1483.26s)]
*  That goes unmentioned. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1484.26s)]
*  And so yes, you do see it now. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1486.06s)]
*  And of course, we should also note the fact that, and this is something I and other international [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1488.1s)]
*  journalists went to Egypt to protest, is Israel is locked out. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1493.48s)]
*  There's no foreign press in Gaza for obvious reasons, and over 120, I think, Palestinian [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1497.92s)]
*  journalists have been killed, many of them targeted. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1505.34s)]
*  Let's talk about Exodus. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1509.08s)]
*  Okay, we'll talk about a trashy novel and a trashy writer, Leonoris. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1511.66s)]
*  You know, the other book that was like that was Oh, Jerusalem. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1519.98s)]
*  That was another one. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1523.02s)]
*  Israelis were, remember that history of the war? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1524.78s)]
*  I think it was anyway, of the founding of Israel. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1527.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, I was probably in high school, just beginning college, when the novel came out. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1531.62s)]
*  And I just remember everybody was reading it. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1537.78s)]
*  You ride the subway in New York and people sitting there reading it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1540.26s)]
*  Well, they said, so it was, I'll just read this. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1543.22s)]
*  It had been compared in epic scope and massive sales to Gone with the Wind. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1545.62s)]
*  Well, there's another piece of propaganda on behalf of slaveholders, which transformed [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1550.3799999999999s)]
*  the history of the Civil War into a shared national past. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1556.98s)]
*  But Exodus is different in that it is not a story told by Israelis about their own country. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1560.16s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1566.14s)]
*  But one told by an American author for American readers, and then she writes later, one cannot [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1567.14s)]
*  overestimate the influence of Exodus in Americanizing the Zionist narrative of Israel's origins. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1573.22s)]
*  20 million copies were sold in 20 years. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1582.7s)]
*  Now, you and I need those kinds of sales, then we can all go to Bermuda forever. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1586.8200000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, it is just remarkable. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1592.58s)]
*  I mean, she rips it to pieces. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1600.02s)]
*  I mean, just the main characters in the film, which also was very, the main characters in [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1602.5s)]
*  the film, because of their whiteness, are easily seen as Euro-Americans. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1608.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, when this film appeared in 1960, the majority of Jewish immigrants coming to [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1613.1s)]
*  North African countries, although not well treated by the European, you know, Netanyahu, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1618.5s)]
*  Yaskinazi and Avi Shlom writes a very good book on this. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1625.42s)]
*  I think it's called Three Worlds, or it's a very, very good, his memoir. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1630.22s)]
*  And then, just one more pass and let you talk. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1635.74s)]
*  So they have, of course, they have the Christian protagonist Kitty, who represents the American, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1640.5s)]
*  who discovers in Zionism the mystical qualities of the Holy Land that she heard about in Sunday [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1648.58s)]
*  School. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1656.3799999999999s)]
*  Kitty speaks the language of the recently invented Judeo-Christian tradition, which [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1657.3799999999999s)]
*  embraces, embraced Catholics, Protestants and Jews in a shared American identity, and [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1662.3s)]
*  during the Cold War, united them in faith against godless communism. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1667.62s)]
*  In Exodus, it also unites them against Arabs. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1671.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1675.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, the interesting thing in that, and she develops it in the book all along, is [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1676.3799999999999s)]
*  the European-ness of these Jews who have been murdered in Europe, who are not admitted in [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1682.6999999999998s)]
*  large numbers into the United States. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1692.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean, everybody's really happy about Israel because it can take the Jews they don't want, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1693.7s)]
*  the Anglo-American, European countries do not want Jews in their midst. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1698.14s)]
*  Let me just interrupt you on the 1952 McLaren Act, which was authored by Senator McLaren, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1704.18s)]
*  a rabid anti-Semite, which is now being used against Palestinian activists who have green [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1710.1000000000001s)]
*  cards and student visas and everything else, was designed to keep out victims of the Holocaust. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1717.98s)]
*  And not let them into the United States. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1724.5s)]
*  That's why he wrote it. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1725.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1726.5s)]
*  No, and so, but what you have in that film, and she describes it really well, is the Europeanization, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1727.5s)]
*  the whitening of the Jew. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1735.3799999999999s)]
*  No longer this sort of stereotypical dark, pathetic, feminized masculinity, but this Paul [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1737.1799999999998s)]
*  Newman character who fights to the death and who is bringing civilization to the Middle [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1745.34s)]
*  East, because that becomes another of the tropes that get associated with Israel, that [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1752.3s)]
*  it is the only democratic, only force for enlightenment and democracy and European values [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1758.78s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1767.18s)]
*  So the film enables that kind of new representation of who Jews are and what they represent. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1768.54s)]
*  She writes, Exodus reenacted the primal myth of the American frontier as a tale of regeneration [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1780.5800000000002s)]
*  through violence. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1787.42s)]
*  She's quoting Richard Slotkin, of course, his great book. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1788.42s)]
*  The hero in a western ventures across the border of the civilized world to the wilderness [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1791.46s)]
*  in order to colonize dark, chaotic regions and learn the way of the Indians, thereby [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1797.54s)]
*  ridding himself and the society he represents of darkness. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1802.22s)]
*  It is the barbarism of the other, whether Indian or Arab, that forces the hero to become [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1806.42s)]
*  violent. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1811.46s)]
*  He adopts their methods in order to defeat them and to establish a border between legitimate [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1812.46s)]
*  and illegitimate violence. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1817.42s)]
*  So when she talks about the Bible and the West, the story of Israel is tailored or created [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1819.26s)]
*  to parallel precisely our own mythology about the settling of the West by Europeans and [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1828.46s)]
*  Euro-Americans. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1834.3400000000001s)]
*  So, Chris, I wondered what you thought about the violence theme as well. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1837.18s)]
*  I thought that was really interesting, the way she maps the justification of violence [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1842.7s)]
*  from the very beginning. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1850.18s)]
*  But then when you get to the war on terror, Israel becomes the model for how to deal with [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1851.6599999999999s)]
*  terrorists in your midst, how to deal with any kind of uprisings or protests. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1859.62s)]
*  They provide some of the technology and the advice not only to the national government, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1865.12s)]
*  but to local police forces about how to contain or track terrorism and contain it in their [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1872.6799999999998s)]
*  cities. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1882.8s)]
*  I thought that the way in which the story becomes the idyllic socialist utopia in the [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1883.8s)]
*  1940s and 50s becomes this arms supplier that provides the technology of war, for the war [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1891.08s)]
*  on terror in the United States, and becomes the model for how to resist it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1902.56s)]
*  I thought was another fascinating aspect of the book. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1906.36s)]
*  She talks about how particular mythologies like this one don't hold up, especially after [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1910.52s)]
*  the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1916.8s)]
*  I think 17,000 Lebanese were killed, they bombed West Beirut, saturated bombing of southern [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1918.8s)]
*  Lebanon, the war was a disaster for Israel. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1924.68s)]
*  You had, as she notes, you had foreign correspondents. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1928.72s)]
*  That was also a very important and good part of the book. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1932.3999999999999s)]
*  You had foreign correspondents based in Beirut who were watching it, John Chancellor, for [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1934.98s)]
*  instance, and were appalled at the savagery. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1940.0s)]
*  So suddenly there had to be a new narrative and that's when the Holocaust took off. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1943.0s)]
*  Maybe we should talk about that. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1949.92s)]
*  Just before we go, just in terms of the way Exodus and the narratives portrayed Arabs, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1952.36s)]
*  they were accused like blacks in antebellum south or even during Jim Crow as sexual predators. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1959.96s)]
*  She exaggerated Arab cowardice. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1969.12s)]
*  There was a characterization of Arabs that very closely paralleled our own defaming of [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1974.7199999999998s)]
*  the character in particular of African Americans in the United States. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1984.56s)]
*  But let's talk about the Holocaust. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1990.06s)]
*  And Finkelstein wrote his book, The Holocaust Industry. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1991.6s)]
*  So the Holocaust is not, as we mentioned earlier, a huge part of the narrative. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=1994.84s)]
*  And then after Lebanon things change. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2000.0s)]
*  So there's a savagery and the Holocaust takes preeminence in the narrative. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2003.28s)]
*  There was a mini-series. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2009.8999999999999s)]
*  I've never watched it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2010.8999999999999s)]
*  Maybe you watched it, but she writes about it in the book called The Holocaust. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2011.9199999999998s)]
*  You have the Holocaust Museum, which she writes about raising the question of why is there [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2015.86s)]
*  a Holocaust Museum on American soil? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2020.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a pretty good question. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2023.6000000000001s)]
*  But let's talk about the use of the Holocaust because that's very much part, and after 9-11 [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2025.8s)]
*  this is all turbocharged as you said, but ideologically it's justified by the near annihilation [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2031.1200000000001s)]
*  of the Jews. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2037.96s)]
*  And just as a caveat in defense of Jewish refugees, the ones who survived World War [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2038.96s)]
*  II, they were locked out of everywhere, number one. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2044.88s)]
*  And when they did try to go home to places like Poland, there were pogroms. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2048.12s)]
*  We're talking about after World War II. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2052.4s)]
*  So they really, I mean that's the part of the tragedy. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2054.04s)]
*  They had nowhere to go. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2057.28s)]
*  There was that book Neighbors, which is very good on people trying to, Jewish families [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2058.32s)]
*  after surviving the death camps trying to go back to their farms or their homes and [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2064.32s)]
*  being killed. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2069.2000000000003s)]
*  So I mean that is, I think, the tragedy for all of us who have covered Israel extensively. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2071.4s)]
*  But let's talk about the Holocaust because the Holocaust becomes weaponized and boy she [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2077.76s)]
*  takes down Elie Wiesel of course who becomes Mr. Holocaust, who I knew actually. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2083.44s)]
*  But let's talk about the Holocaust and its uses and what she writes about it. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2093.8s)]
*  Well it's Peter Novick also who writes about the Holocaust industry. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2099.0s)]
*  And I think he dates it even to 1967 after the Six Day War. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2104.32s)]
*  It becomes more and more of a justification for the kinds of things that Israel is doing. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2108.5600000000004s)]
*  And then in the 80s, it comes into its own as an attempt to justify what can't be justified [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  in terms of the war in Lebanon. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2120.48s)]
*  But I think that the point she makes about it is that it becomes, again it's tied to [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2123.6000000000004s)]
*  that invincible victim thing. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2130.04s)]
*  The threat, the Holocaust happened, but it's never going to go away. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2133.32s)]
*  That is, it happened, but it always exists as a possibility for happening again. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2141.6s)]
*  And so part of the invincible victim story is that Jews have to always be alert about [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2146.52s)]
*  defending themselves against any sign that the Holocaust is about to reappear. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2153.7599999999998s)]
*  And then attributed to Palestinians, the possibility that they will bring another Holocaust. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2160.0800000000004s)]
*  So the whole defense industry of Israel, the whole occupation of Gaza and the West Bank [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2168.48s)]
*  become a way of arguing against the possibility of another Holocaust. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2175.52s)]
*  What does she call that chapter? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2180.88s)]
*  The Holocaust anticipated or the apocalypse soon, she calls it. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2182.28s)]
*  The two chapters, the future Holocaust and apocalypse soon, are the arguments about we [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2187.7999999999997s)]
*  can never rest because once it's happened, it always will happen again. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  And the existence of Jews by definition somehow suggests the possibility always of a Holocaust. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2200.08s)]
*  And that makes them, you can't criticize anything that's being done in the name of not only [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2206.7599999999998s)]
*  repairing the damage of the first Holocaust, but of preventing the next one. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2216.44s)]
*  And this is Abba Eban, who I also knew, very charming. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2221.96s)]
*  Another factor that worked against the image of Palestinians in America was the overt effort [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2227.44s)]
*  by Israeli spokesmen and sympathetic journalists to undermine the revolutionary appeal of Palestinian [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2232.48s)]
*  resistance. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2237.68s)]
*  Abba Eban protested that the guerrillas were not, quote, fighting for freedom, but were [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2238.68s)]
*  in fact fighters against freedom. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2243.6s)]
*  He explained that, quote, the image that world opinion should have of them is not the image [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2246.2799999999997s)]
*  of the Marquis or resistance fighters, but the image of the SS, the image of the guards [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2250.48s)]
*  at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2257.08s)]
*  We've seen that during the genocide where now, you know, was it Begin who equated, yeah, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2260.52s)]
*  Begin who told Reagan that when he was bombing West Beirut, he was attacking Hitler. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2266.56s)]
*  I mean, he was attacking Arafat, but that it was, he drew that analogy. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2273.68s)]
*  That has not gone away. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2278.3599999999997s)]
*  That now becomes the raison d'etre for the subjugation of the Palestinians and the decimation [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2280.12s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2288.3599999999997s)]
*  And Hamas is the new Nazi. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2290.12s)]
*  She has a thing where, it's interesting where she talks about this further. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2292.96s)]
*  She says, terrorist violence by non-state actors, no matter how heinous, lacks the powerful [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2296.96s)]
*  state organization behind the systematic industrialized violence that characterized [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2303.0s)]
*  the Nazi slaughter of millions. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2308.12s)]
*  Nonetheless, the repeated analogy between terrorism and the Holocaust had the powerful [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2310.2s)]
*  effect of tarring the entire Palestinian cause as a hateful reincarnation of the Nazi project [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2315.36s)]
*  to exterminate the Jews. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2322.84s)]
*  At a time when the Carter and Reagan administrations continued Kissinger's pledge to Israel not [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2324.92s)]
*  to speak directly to the PLO, the conflation of Palestinians with terrorism and Nazism [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2329.6s)]
*  contributed to the public perception of the illegitimacy of the PLO and the cause it represented. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2334.7599999999998s)]
*  And that goes on now. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2339.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how many people I've had, fortunately they're not friends, they're [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2340.7599999999998s)]
*  just people I know who I've had conversations with who say, well, but Hamas is just like [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2346.24s)]
*  the Nazis. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2350.56s)]
*  They want to exterminate Jews. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2351.56s)]
*  They want to destroy the state of Israel. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2354.52s)]
*  And you say to them, well, it's not the same thing. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2356.32s)]
*  And there's no, the Nazi image attached now to the Palestinian cause is really hard to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2359.4s)]
*  argue against. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2367.36s)]
*  That's a very important point. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2370.2400000000002s)]
*  CLR James makes the same point that she made in Black Jacobins where he acknowledges that [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2371.2400000000002s)]
*  there were atrocities carried out during the only successful slave revolt in human history, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2377.84s)]
*  but that it didn't have the state apparatus behind it. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2384.2000000000003s)]
*  It didn't have the imperial power. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2388.0s)]
*  But it's a very, very, very important point. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2389.68s)]
*  I don't want to sugarcoat Hamas has spent a lot of time with them. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2392.2s)]
*  But that point is key. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2396.16s)]
*  And she writes about the Christian Zionism at the end of the book. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2399.8s)]
*  The Israel becomes more and more unpalatable to a younger generation of Jews, of course, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2409.8s)]
*  because a significant percentage of those protesting the genocide were Jewish. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2417.36s)]
*  We have Jewish voice for peace. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2421.7200000000003s)]
*  We had students in Columbia just chain themselves to a fence in protest at the deportation order [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2424.56s)]
*  against Amakman Halil held in a Louisiana detention center. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2431.1200000000003s)]
*  And so they have turned more and more to, and she writes about this, these Christian [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2438.32s)]
*  Zionists, Hagee, these figures. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2442.72s)]
*  And it's fascinating because they themselves have expressed very open anti-Semitic tropes. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2447.48s)]
*  But they become key. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2458.4399999999996s)]
*  And then there's organizing all these tours of the biblical holy land. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2459.4399999999996s)]
*  I would argue as well that as Israel has become more and more despotic, that has also built [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2465.36s)]
*  these relations with figures like Viktor Orban, because it's the model of how figures like [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2474.52s)]
*  Netanyahu seek to run the Israeli state. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2480.2799999999997s)]
*  They're all heirs of Vladimir Jabotinsky, who Mussolini called a good fascist, Mer Kahana. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2482.72s)]
*  I covered Kahana. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2488.24s)]
*  I knew him. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2489.24s)]
*  Let's talk about that, which he does at the end of the book about Christian Zionism. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2493.8s)]
*  Well I think we talked about it a little at the beginning. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2500.56s)]
*  It's the notion that somehow or another the biblical prophecy has the end times happen [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2503.92s)]
*  in Israel, when the second coming of Christ will bring about a new world order, in which [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2511.24s)]
*  converted Jews will be raptured up with the Christians and the rest of us will burn in [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2524.7999999999997s)]
*  hell or just burn. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2531.9199999999996s)]
*  But the power of that, and you're right, of these anti-Semites who are endorsing the Israeli [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2536.08s)]
*  cause, and sometimes even she has moments where Netanyahu and others realize that, that [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2544.7999999999997s)]
*  they're dealing with anti-Semites. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2550.52s)]
*  But it doesn't matter, because they're bringing a large sector of the American population, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2551.52s)]
*  a powerfully politically influential sector of the American population, certainly now [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2558.08s)]
*  with Trump, to support the activities that Israel is engaging in. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2563.24s)]
*  When Trump moved the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, it was a fulfillment [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2571.08s)]
*  of the demand that these Christian Zionists had been making to prepare us for the eventual [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2579.3999999999996s)]
*  second coming. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2589.24s)]
*  It's tied really tightly to their notion of history, if we want to call it history. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2590.8799999999997s)]
*  It's also tied to their mythic version of America, of a white, patriarchal America, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  of battling against the subhuman elements, and of course the Ashkenazi European elite [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2610.8s)]
*  like Netanyahu's family comes from Poland, Netanyahu was raised in Philadelphia and went [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2622.96s)]
*  to MIT. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2627.04s)]
*  That also correlates with the very demented vision of Christian Zionism. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2630.04s)]
*  Well, in fact, there's a part, as you're saying, in it, identification with Israel [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2635.12s)]
*  did not mean identification with actual Jews, however, either in America or Israel. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2641.44s)]
*  La Hay warned that Jews as a group have often yielded to secularistic, even atheistic spirit. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2646.64s)]
*  Brilliant minds have all too frequently been dedicated to philosophies, harmful, da-da-da. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2652.8s)]
*  Once Jews have been restored to Zion, they would have a second chance to redeem themselves [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2657.92s)]
*  from the sin of choosing Jesus. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2661.52s)]
*  But then she says, and this is the part that I think you're pointing at, just as Israel [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2663.84s)]
*  enabled God to fulfill his promise to the Jews, so could America become the promised [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2668.4s)]
*  land for Christians. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2673.52s)]
*  And this is a quote from Jimmy Swaggart, America is tied by a spiritual, umbilical cord to [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2675.36s)]
*  Israel, he writes. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2680.08s)]
*  The Judeo-Christian concept goes all the way back to Abraham and God's promise to Abraham. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2681.76s)]
*  The Jewish people represent Judaism, the American people represent Christianity. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2686.8s)]
*  Swaggart viewed the American people as white, evangelical Christians, while Israel alone [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2692.16s)]
*  represented Jews and Judaism. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2696.72s)]
*  I mean, there's the link that you're talking about. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2698.3999999999996s)]
*  Because as she points out, America is not in the Bible. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2703.04s)]
*  I mean, there is no direct biblical passage that can be used to call Americans the chosen [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2716.64s)]
*  And so that identification with Israel becomes a way to essentially bridge that gap. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2718.6s)]
*  I just want to end with, she does a masterful job of taking down Thomas Friedman, I find [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2728.68s)]
*  great joy in this. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes, I actually loved that part. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2739.7999999999997s)]
*  And she calls them out for the false narrative of equivalence. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2742.76s)]
*  I'm just going to read this paragraph. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  This narrative of equivalence relies on potent analogies with America that kept Palestinians [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2760.84s)]
*  from capturing the moral high ground in the battle for representation. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2766.5600000000004s)]
*  At the beginning of the uprising when the Israeli army faced criticism for firing live [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2771.0s)]
*  ammunition at protesters, Friedman instructed television viewers on how to view the violence. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2778.16s)]
*  They were not watching the equivalent of Birmingham in 1960 or Berkeley in 1968, he wrote, but [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2785.64s)]
*  the equivalent of Bull Run in 1861. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2791.16s)]
*  It would no more occur to them, quote, to use rubber bullets against the Palestinians [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2800.4s)]
*  than it would have occurred to the North to use rubber bullets against the South in the [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2804.84s)]
*  Civil War. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2808.6s)]
*  The civil rights analogy compares Palestinians to black Americans fighting for equal rights [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2810.36s)]
*  against violent police powers. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2815.44s)]
*  The Civil War analogy, in contrast, conveys the impression of two matched military forces [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2818.6800000000003s)]
*  capable of doing equal harm to each other. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2825.04s)]
*  That's really, really important. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2826.88s)]
*  And Schipler does it, Friedman does it, just about even most of our liberal commentators [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2830.32s)]
*  on Israel-Palestine, Friedman's no friend of Netanyahu, of course, do it. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2836.6400000000003s)]
*  And she's not buying it. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2843.12s)]
*  And let's just close by talking about that false equivalency. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2846.12s)]
*  And she says in that section that you were reading, she ends by saying the Civil War [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2850.7200000000003s)]
*  analogy conveys the impression of two matched military forces capable of doing equal harm [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2854.4s)]
*  to each other, which is still how the, well, which is now how the Gaza war is presented. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2860.2000000000003s)]
*  It's as if Hamas and Israel were the same or the Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2867.6s)]
*  and domination were, it was the North versus the South. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2877.08s)]
*  On the one hand, you have a nuclear armed military giant against a Palestinian resistance [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2882.92s)]
*  that is nowhere near, has nowhere near the force or the... [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2890.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, they're just insurgent, they're just an asymmetrical insurgent with small arms. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2896.08s)]
*  The other thing she points out is how they, the use, the way these writers like Friedman [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2902.04s)]
*  will justify Israeli atrocities is they will always search out David Hartman, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2909.28s)]
*  Rabbi David Hartman used to be the figure they'd all, he was quoted every week in the New York Times [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2914.7200000000003s)]
*  about their angst, about, you know, we wish we didn't have to shoot them kind of thing. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2919.36s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he says again, and he recognizes, this is Friedman, the brutal record of Israeli rage [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2925.28s)]
*  in the X-rays, hundreds of Palestinians who had their arms or legs or ribs broken by Israeli soldiers. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2932.6000000000004s)]
*  Yet he wants his readers to understand, quote, the real fear behind the Israeli clubs, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2937.48s)]
*  the fear of never feeling truly at home, at home in a land claimed by others, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  the land that they have taken from the others. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2947.52s)]
*  So... [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2951.4s)]
*  Just, she also writes, by seeking symmetry in the human equivalence of two sides, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2952.4s)]
*  unstructured by political power relations, that's key. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2957.6s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2961.36s)]
*  Liberals like Schipler and Friedman implicitly rejected the perspective Edward Said called Zionism [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2962.24s)]
*  from the standpoint of its victims. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2968.3999999999996s)]
*  Instead, they expanded the Zionist standpoint to incorporate Palestinian perspective, perspectives, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2971.08s)]
*  but these perspectives were dependent on Israeli identified narratives, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2978.04s)]
*  and that is never, unfortunately, changed. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2982.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. So it's a book for now. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2985.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's a very smart book, and as I said, it's well-written. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2989.64s)]
*  I didn't mean to dump on all academics when we were together. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2993.64s)]
*  I know some academics make an effort. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2996.28s)]
*  I wish more did, but it is. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=2998.8s)]
*  It's really smart, really lucid. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3001.56s)]
*  I really enjoyed it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3003.84s)]
*  I've read so many books on the Middle East, and I found it refreshing because there was just a lot in here [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3004.84s)]
*  that made me think, and I'm not sure I'd ever read... [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3012.4s)]
*  I don't think I've ever read a book that approached the conflict as a part of cultural studies, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3017.2799999999997s)]
*  which was really, really smart. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3022.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3024.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, you know, the nice thing about that is that you could say that our books live on after we don't, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3025.56s)]
*  and this is a case, it's a real tribute to Amy Kaplan, that she has given us something that we can still use, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3033.4799999999996s)]
*  even though she's not here anymore to talk about it. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3040.0s)]
*  It's a really, really good book. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3043.24s)]
*  Thank you, Joan. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3047.16s)]
*  We're talking about Our American Israel by Amy Kaplan. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwJ-SfrIuQ&t=3048.56s)]
