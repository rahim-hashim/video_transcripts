Video Description: Donald Trump says he'll be "very firm" with Benjamin Netanyahu on ending the war in Gaza when the Israeli Prime Minister visits the White House on Monday. 
He's pressed Hamas to take the deal, threatening 'it will only get worse' if they don't - and, with Iran weakened following Trump's so-called 'daddy diplomacy', the terror group has indicated it's open to a ceasefire. Israel will want the remaining hostages released, but so far Netanyahu has only said: “There will be no Hamas”.  So, what is going to break the deadlock?
Piers Morgan is joined by lawyer Alan Dershowitz and secretary general of the Palestinian National Initiative, Mustafa Barghouti.
Piers then speaks to Leigh Evans, the nurse from Wales who went viral after a video was posted of him begging to Egyptian police to get into Gaza and British commentator Owen Jones, who is left red-faced about his view on Bob Vylan after Piers shows him newfound footage of the rapper on stage...

# "The REAL Terrorist Is YOU!" Trump's Israel-Hamas Ceasefire Deal | Owen Jones Gets It Wrong!
**Piers Morgan - Israel Palestine:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM)
*  I think the real terrorist is you and the real criminal is you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=0.0s)]
*  If Hamas hadn't done October 7th, if they hadn't used human shields, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4.0s)]
*  if they didn't use hospitals, there wouldn't have been a single person, a single civilian killed. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=8.0s)]
*  You are a liar and you don't have manners and you should shut up. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=13.0s)]
*  Shut up please. Shut up and let me finish. Shut up. Shut up. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=17.0s)]
*  When you watched that rapper at Glastonbury chanting and leading a chant with thousands joining in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=21.0s)]
*  of death to the IDF, you instinctively believed... [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=26.0s)]
*  He said it himself. It means the dismantling of a violent military machine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=29.0s)]
*  He said it since the Fiori blow up. Do you believe him 100%? Yes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=32.0s)]
*  Because new footage has emerged. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=35.0s)]
*  And death to every single IDF soldier out there as an agent of terror. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=37.0s)]
*  But he's completely contradicted everything you've just said. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=43.0s)]
*  I'm not Bob Villain's face. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=46.0s)]
*  You just have to admit when you hear that you were wrong to defend him in the way you defended him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=48.0s)]
*  Now you've heard that, do you still say he only meant the entity? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=53.0s)]
*  Obviously now he's made clear what he meant. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=56.0s)]
*  He's made all of you look like complete prunes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=58.0s)]
*  Donald Trump says he'll be very firm with Benjamin Netanyahu on ending the war in Gaza [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=61.0s)]
*  when the Israeli Prime Minister visits the White House on Monday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=66.0s)]
*  And the President may have already had a breakthrough. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=69.0s)]
*  He announced on Truth Social, his social media platform, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=71.0s)]
*  Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-day ceasefire [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=74.0s)]
*  during which time we will work with all parties to end the war. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=79.0s)]
*  The Qataris and Egyptians will work very hard to help bring peace [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=82.0s)]
*  or deliver this final proposal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=86.0s)]
*  He's pressed Hamas to take the deal, threatening it will only get worse if they don't. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=88.0s)]
*  With Iran weakened following Trump's so-called daddy diplomacy, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=92.0s)]
*  the Syria group has indicated it's open to a ceasefire. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=95.0s)]
*  Israel will want the remaining hostages released. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=98.0s)]
*  But so far Netanyahu has only said there will be no Hamas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=101.0s)]
*  So what will break the deadlock? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=105.0s)]
*  Joining me to discuss the ceasefire is lawyer and author of The Preventative State, Alan Dershowitz. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=107.0s)]
*  I'm the General Secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, Dr Mustafa Barghouti. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=111.0s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=116.0s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz, how likely is it, do you think, that this proposal, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=117.0s)]
*  which Donald Trump has talked about on Truth Social, will actually manifest itself imminently? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=123.0s)]
*  Well, the latest report is that the Israelis have accepted it, probably reluctantly, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=130.0s)]
*  but they've accepted it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=135.0s)]
*  You don't say no to Donald Trump. You don't want to be Zelensky. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=137.0s)]
*  Trump helped Israel on Iran. Israel owes him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=140.0s)]
*  And therefore, I think Israel will accept the deal as is, even though they would like to see some changes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=144.0s)]
*  The most recent report is Hamas said no, and that's what led Trump to say, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=150.0s)]
*  you better accept this deal because it's only going to get worse. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=154.0s)]
*  The history of Palestinian leadership has been a history of rejecting good deals. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=157.0s)]
*  They were offered a state on 70 percent of the arable land in 1948. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=161.0s)]
*  They turned it down. They were offered a state in 1967. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=166.0s)]
*  They were offered a state in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=169.0s)]
*  They've always wanted a better deal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=173.0s)]
*  And as President Clinton said, when you turn down deals like this, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=175.0s)]
*  you're not going to get a better deal. You're going to get a worse deal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=178.0s)]
*  So I'm hoping that we'll get back to October 6. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=181.0s)]
*  Remember, on October 6, there was a ceasefire. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=184.0s)]
*  In effect, nonetheless, on October 7, Hamas went and killed 1,200 innocent Israelis [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=187.0s)]
*  and held hostage 250 others. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=194.0s)]
*  Nonetheless, I hope there will be a deal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=197.0s)]
*  But the ball is clearly right now in the court of Hamas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=199.0s)]
*  OK, Mustafa Barghouti, why wouldn't Hamas accept this deal? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=202.0s)]
*  No, thank you. I want to correct the information first. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=207.0s)]
*  Israel did not accept the deal yet. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=211.0s)]
*  Mr. Trump did not say that Israel accepted the deal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=213.0s)]
*  President Trump said that Israel accepted or is accepting necessary conditions [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=218.0s)]
*  to finalize the deal. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=225.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean they have accepted the deal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=227.0s)]
*  And up till now, there is no statement from the Israeli government [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=229.0s)]
*  that they have accepted anything. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=233.0s)]
*  Netanyahu faces a very serious opposition from two major fascist ministers in his government, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=235.0s)]
*  Smotrich and Bingvir, who are threatening to bring down his government if he accepts any deal. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=241.0s)]
*  So in reality, Israel still did not accept the deal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=248.0s)]
*  Amman did not yet accept the deal, but did not reject it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=252.0s)]
*  So the matter is still being negotiated between the mediators and the two sides. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=255.0s)]
*  And it is not acceptable to rush in claiming that it is Israel that accepted and Palestinians did not. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=261.0s)]
*  On the other hand, I have to clarify. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=268.0s)]
*  Why doesn't Hamas now announce that he would accept Israel and accept it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=270.0s)]
*  Mr. Bismorgan, I want to be polite in this meeting, in this discussion. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=275.0s)]
*  So if Mr. Doshovich interrupts me again, I will not be silent. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=280.0s)]
*  So please let him not interrupt me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=286.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=288.0s)]
*  He's not the one who's interviewing me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=289.0s)]
*  It's you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=291.0s)]
*  So please stay silent till I finish my talk. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=292.0s)]
*  Israel is saying Israel is the one that have destroyed any possibility for peace, not Palestinians. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=295.0s)]
*  When did Israel accept to end its occupation of Palestinian land? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=305.0s)]
*  When did Israel accept the right of the Palestinian people? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=309.0s)]
*  Shut up, please, and let me finish. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=313.0s)]
*  Shut up. Shut up. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=315.0s)]
*  You asked the question. I want to answer it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=317.0s)]
*  You keep interrupting me. Don't interrupt me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=319.0s)]
*  I did not interrupt you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=322.0s)]
*  When you ask the question, I want to answer it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=323.0s)]
*  You asked the question. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=327.0s)]
*  This time, don't ask me questions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=329.0s)]
*  You are not the interviewer. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=331.0s)]
*  You shut up and let me finish. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=333.0s)]
*  Israel is the one that rejected the deal. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=335.0s)]
*  You ask the question and I will answer it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=337.0s)]
*  Israel is the one that rejected to end occupation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=339.0s)]
*  Israel is the one that refuses up to now the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=342.0s)]
*  Not only that, Israel passed a law in the Israeli Knesset which said that the right of self-determination on the land of historic Palestine, which they call Eretz Israel, is exclusive for Jewish people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=348.0s)]
*  So don't talk to me about peace. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=366.0s)]
*  Israel is the main obstacle to peace. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=369.0s)]
*  Israel has always been the main obstacle to peace. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=371.0s)]
*  Israel will always be the main obstacle to peace as long as they have these fascists in the government. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=375.0s)]
*  Let me answer your question. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=380.0s)]
*  Let me answer your question, please. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=383.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton has stated, and he stated publicly, it's on videotape, that he and Ehud Barak offered the Palestinians 96% of the West Bank, 4% of Israel, capital in Jerusalem, many, many other inducements. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=386.0s)]
*  And Bill Clinton has said that Yasser Arafat, although he had told them initially he would accept it, he rejected it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=400.0s)]
*  The Palestinians have rejected statehood in 1947, 1937, 2000, 2001, 2007. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=406.0s)]
*  So why is Israel refusing to now the establishment? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=415.0s)]
*  Now you're interrupting me. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=419.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton offered them and Ehud Barak offered them. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=421.0s)]
*  The Palestinians, as a leader once said, don't know how to accept yes for an answer. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=425.0s)]
*  Israelis have offered a two-state solution over and over and over and over again. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=430.0s)]
*  The Palestinians don't want a two-state solution because as Bill Clinton said, this is Bill Clinton, not me, Hamas just wants to kill Jews. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=435.0s)]
*  But isn't the truth, Alan? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=443.0s)]
*  The Palestinians don't want to be a nation state of the Jewish people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=445.0s)]
*  They reject the two-state solution, period. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=447.0s)]
*  But Alan, isn't it also true that Benjamin Netanyahu has no desire for a two-state solution? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=449.0s)]
*  Never has done. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=454.0s)]
*  And in fact, the whole reason he went along with Hamas getting power in Gaza was because he wanted to create a split between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas and split the Palestinian people. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=455.0s)]
*  I don't think he's ever shown any real desire for a two-state solution. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=466.0s)]
*  So isn't that a problem on both sides? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=470.0s)]
*  It is, but if the Palestinians were to accept a two-state solution, were to accept Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=474.0s)]
*  I actually sat across the table from the head of the Palestinian Authority and I asked him, would you say the following? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=481.0s)]
*  Would you say, I accept Israel as a Jewish state? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=489.0s)]
*  And if you do, I will call Benjamin Netanyahu, my friend, and I will ask him to say the same thing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=492.0s)]
*  He said, I can't say that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=498.0s)]
*  The Palestinians have never accepted a two-state solution. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=499.0s)]
*  Israel has, you're right, Netanyahu is not going to be the first person to accept a two-state solution. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=502.0s)]
*  But I guarantee you this, if the Palestinians and Hamas came to the bargaining table and said, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=509.0s)]
*  we recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people, we put down our arms, we declare peace, we want to have mutual agreement, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=514.0s)]
*  we accept Israel joining the Abraham Accords with Saudi Arabia, a two-state solution would be accepted by the Israeli public. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=522.0s)]
*  Let Hamas do that and we'll see whether Benjamin Netanyahu follows Ben Gavir and Smutrich, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=531.0s)]
*  which I think he won't, or whether he follows the majority of the Israeli people, which just want peace. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=537.0s)]
*  They don't want a repetition about October 7th. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=543.0s)]
*  How damaging, Alan? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=546.0s)]
*  If you can guarantee them that, they will accept. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=547.0s)]
*  Hang on, Mustafa, I'll come to you in one second. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=549.0s)]
*  I just want to ask Alan, how damaging is it that Smutrich in particular and Ben Gavir, these very hard-right members of this government, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=551.0s)]
*  Smutrich is now on record, but he's now saying he wants to cleanse Gaza of all Palestinians. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=560.0s)]
*  That is ethnic cleansing. That would be a war crime. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=566.0s)]
*  And yet I keep being told he doesn't represent the government. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=569.0s)]
*  He's a senior member of this government. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=572.0s)]
*  Well, and you get people in Hamas who are senior members of their government and people in the Palestinian Authority who make statements like that. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=576.0s)]
*  He does not speak for the Israeli government. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=582.0s)]
*  The Israeli government has a mechanism by which people speak for them. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=585.0s)]
*  Netanyahu speaks for the Israeli government. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=589.0s)]
*  The Israeli people speak for the Israeli government. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=592.0s)]
*  Smutrich and Ben Gavir are two people who I find despicable. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=595.0s)]
*  I despise them. I attack them. I reject them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=600.0s)]
*  Most Israelis reject them in order to remain in power. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=603.0s)]
*  Netanyahu has had to tolerate them. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=606.0s)]
*  But if Hamas would come forward and create a situation where there'd be no repetition of October 7th, Smutrich and Ben Gavir would be history. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=609.0s)]
*  And we would move on to a two-state solution. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=617.0s)]
*  OK, Mustafa, your response. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=619.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me go back to Clinton. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=622.0s)]
*  It's not true what was said because in reality no Palestinian state was ever offered to Palestinians. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=625.0s)]
*  If Bill Clinton is biased to Israel, it's his problem. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=633.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that what he tells is the truth. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=636.0s)]
*  And the proof to that, that the Israelis never accepted that Jerusalem would be the capital of Palestine. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=639.0s)]
*  And there is no Israeli politician, whoever, that is ready to accept that Jerusalem would be the capital of Palestine. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=645.0s)]
*  That's one. Second, I live in the West Bank. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=653.0s)]
*  You are a liar and you don't have manners. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=657.0s)]
*  And you should shut up because you are a person who does not understand the proper way of dialogue. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=660.0s)]
*  You have to be polite and let me answer. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=667.0s)]
*  You don't like my answer. It's your problem. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=669.0s)]
*  You can not accept it, but you cannot say that I am lying. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=672.0s)]
*  You are the one who keeps lying. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=676.0s)]
*  You are lying. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=678.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=679.0s)]
*  You are lying. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=680.0s)]
*  You know what? You are impolite. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=681.0s)]
*  And I am not surprised because a person like you who used to defend people like Epstein, the sex trafficker, is not surprising. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=683.0s)]
*  I knew you'd get into that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=691.0s)]
*  I know that you are a person who is impolite. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=692.0s)]
*  I knew you'd get into that because you have no reasonable answers on the matter. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=695.0s)]
*  And you have no manners whatsoever. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=700.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=704.0s)]
*  Smotrich and Bingvir of course represent the Israeli government. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=705.0s)]
*  Smotrich is the finance minister of Israel. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=709.0s)]
*  Smotrich is the finance minister of Israel. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=712.0s)]
*  That means he is the second most important minister in the Israeli government. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=715.0s)]
*  And it was not only Smotrich who said that he will not accept that he wants to call for ethnic lending of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=720.0s)]
*  It was Netanyahu. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=732.0s)]
*  Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, who calls for that, who speaks about that, who talks about it and call it Trump's vision of ethnic lending of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=734.0s)]
*  I live in the West Bank. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=746.0s)]
*  You live in New York. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=747.0s)]
*  You don't know what's happening. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=748.0s)]
*  I live in the West Bank where the Israeli illegal settlers, the terrorist settlers under Netanyahu have conducted 333 attacks on us, the Palestinians in the West Bank, the civilians in the West Bank. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=750.0s)]
*  In the last month alone, in June, we are encountering not only illegal settlers but an Israeli army that has imposed 1,000 military checkpoints all over the West Bank, preventing normal life of people, besieging villages, besieging communities. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=763.0s)]
*  They have destroyed everything in the West Bank. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=781.0s)]
*  I'm not talking only about Gaza. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=784.0s)]
*  In Gaza, up to now, according to the most recent study of Michael Spagat, who is an international renounced demographer, says that Israel has killed more than 75,000 Palestinians already in Gaza, including no less than 58% of them are women and children. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=786.0s)]
*  This is the highest number of civilians killed in any war. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=807.0s)]
*  Children are 19-year-olds with guns. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=810.0s)]
*  No, children below the age of 19. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=814.0s)]
*  Hang on, let me jump in here. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=816.0s)]
*  Let me jump in here, Mustafa. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=818.0s)]
*  Let me jump in. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=820.0s)]
*  So we are dealing here, wait a minute, last minute, last point. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=821.0s)]
*  Netanyahu came to power to kill Oslo agreement. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=826.0s)]
*  He wrote that in his book. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=829.0s)]
*  If he's your friend, read his books. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=831.0s)]
*  He wrote in his book, we will never allow a Palestinian independent state. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=833.0s)]
*  This is the kind of government we are dealing with, a government of fascists, a government of extremists, a government of criminals, even ex-prime minister in Israel, like Yehud Olmert, are saying that Israel is becoming a pariah state because of Netanyahu. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=838.0s)]
*  I mean, Alan, there's no doubt... [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=856.0s)]
*  Let me respond, please. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=858.0s)]
*  Let me just ask you a question, though, because there's no doubt to me that Israel's government is currently, with the way it's prosecuting this war in Gaza in the last few months, is very rapidly losing global support, even from key allies who do not think this is self-defense anymore. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=859.0s)]
*  And they're joining the dots with what people like Smodritch are saying, and they fear there is a much bigger plan that is now unfurling, which is to get rid of all the Palestinians. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=878.0s)]
*  And in relation to the number of children being killed, you know, obviously you don't believe every statistic that comes out of the Hamas-run health authority, although historically their numbers have later proven to be broadly accurate. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=887.0s)]
*  That is a fact. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=900.0s)]
*  But the reality is we know from reporters on the ground, we know that probably 20 to 25,000 children have been killed here. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=902.0s)]
*  This cannot, cannot be right, Alan, that this continues. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=911.0s)]
*  Well, let me respond. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=915.0s)]
*  Let me respond. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=917.0s)]
*  There was a war in Iran. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=918.0s)]
*  Israel went in, destroyed much of the military capacity, and they killed an incredibly tiny number of civilians, very, very few, in the low hundreds, which proves clearly that the only reason that civilians have been killed in the Gaza Strip is because they're used as human shields, because the leaders... [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=920.0s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=941.0s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=942.0s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=943.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=944.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. Let me finish. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=945.0s)]
*  Well, OK. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=946.0s)]
*  I don't agree with your summation, but finish your sentence. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=947.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=949.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=950.0s)]
*  My point is when Sinwar hid, where did he hide? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=951.0s)]
*  He had hid underneath a hospital with nine of his people. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=954.0s)]
*  Israel had to kill all of them. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=957.0s)]
*  And yes, they killed 16 civilians. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=959.0s)]
*  That's proportional. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=961.0s)]
*  Let me tell you, if Hamas hadn't done October 7th, if they hadn't used human shields, if they didn't use hospitals, there wouldn't have been a single person, a single civilian, killed. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=963.0s)]
*  Israel prides itself on being able to target... [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=972.0s)]
*  What about the civilians killed in the West Bank? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=975.0s)]
*  ...on being able to target... Stop cutting me off. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=977.0s)]
*  ...being able to target military targets like the Iranian nuclear reactors. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=979.0s)]
*  When it destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor, one civilian casualty. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=984.0s)]
*  Syria, no civilian casualties. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=989.0s)]
*  Iran, very few. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=992.0s)]
*  Why Gaza? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=994.0s)]
*  Because they use human shields. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=995.0s)]
*  Yes, but... [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=998.0s)]
*  Because they hide their commanders among the children in order to induce Israel to kill children so that people like you can get on television and correctly point out that so many civilians have been killed. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=999.0s)]
*  It's all the fault of Hamas. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1013.0s)]
*  Here's the problem I have with that theory, which is this. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1015.0s)]
*  I hear it a lot. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1019.0s)]
*  But if you look at the way that Israel dealt with Hezbollah, for example, a very carefully planned and well executed plan that targeted almost exclusively the Hezbollah terrorists, right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1020.0s)]
*  Again, very surgical, very targeted, like Iran. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1031.0s)]
*  They were condemned for that as well. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1034.0s)]
*  I just don't believe that the combined brainpower of Mossad and the IDF could not have come up with a better way... [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1036.0s)]
*  IDF has... [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1045.0s)]
*  Hang on, let me finish. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1046.0s)]
*  Mossad has no jurisdiction over Gaza. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1048.0s)]
*  Let me just correct you. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1051.0s)]
*  But the idea that Mossad wouldn't have known stuff going on in Gaza is for the birds. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1052.0s)]
*  And I just cannot understand why, given the global dismay about what has been happening in Gaza, with the destruction of 70% of Gaza now, with so many children being killed, everybody accepts that Israel is trying to go after the children. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1059.0s)]
*  Israel is trying to go after Hamas, but they also accept and understand, because it's clear that way too many children are being killed here and that the end goal of getting the hostages released is not happening, right? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1077.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1089.0s)]
*  The language for Smodric makes people think there's a different plan going on here. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1090.0s)]
*  And so my question really is... [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1094.0s)]
*  He has no influence. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1095.0s)]
*  There has to have been a better way than just leveling Gaza to the ground. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1096.0s)]
*  And I think it's been driven by... [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1100.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1102.0s)]
*  Do you not think? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1103.0s)]
*  No. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1104.0s)]
*  I agree with you that there has to be a better way. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1106.0s)]
*  And the better way would have been for Hamas to come out and fight in the open like brave people do all over the world. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1108.0s)]
*  But instead they hide behind children and babies. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1115.0s)]
*  That is not... [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1117.0s)]
*  They use them as human shields. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1118.0s)]
*  And that's why Israel has to go in, in order to dismantle Hamas. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1119.0s)]
*  They tragically... [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1124.0s)]
*  Israel never benefits from killing a civilian. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1125.0s)]
*  Why would any Israeli ever want to kill a civilian? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1128.0s)]
*  So why does it keep doing that? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1131.0s)]
*  They wouldn't want to do that. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1132.0s)]
*  They lose in your court of public opinion. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1133.0s)]
*  They lose on your television show if they kill a civilian. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1136.0s)]
*  They don't want to kill civilians. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1140.0s)]
*  Hamas makes them kill civilians. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1142.0s)]
*  They've never killed more civilians. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1143.0s)]
*  There are quotes from Hamas leaders saying, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1144.0s)]
*  Alan, Israel's never killed more civilians. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1146.0s)]
*  They're martyrs. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1149.0s)]
*  We want you to kill more civilians. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1150.0s)]
*  That's what Hamas says. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1152.0s)]
*  Well then you're playing into their hands, aren't you? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1153.0s)]
*  So... [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1155.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1156.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1157.0s)]
*  And I wish they did. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1158.0s)]
*  So it's a catastrophically bad strategy. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1159.0s)]
*  Because if you say that's Hamas's... [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1161.0s)]
*  It is, except they don't want another... [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1163.0s)]
*  If you say that is Hamas's... [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1165.0s)]
*  They don't want another October 7th. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1166.0s)]
*  If you say that is the game Hamas wants to play, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1167.0s)]
*  then Israel is playing the game that the enemy wants them to play. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1170.0s)]
*  That's the problem with it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1174.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1176.0s)]
*  And they have an alternative. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1177.0s)]
*  They have an alternative. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1178.0s)]
*  Just not go after Hamas. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1179.0s)]
*  And let Gaza continue. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1181.0s)]
*  And let there be what Hamas has said. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1183.0s)]
*  Over and over again, more October 7th, more hostages. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1185.0s)]
*  That's the alternative. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1189.0s)]
*  But if you want to destroy Hamas, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1190.0s)]
*  you have to kill the civilians who are being used as human shields. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1192.0s)]
*  It's a tragic choice. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1196.0s)]
*  I wish Israel didn't have to make it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1198.0s)]
*  But it's a choice inflicted on them by Hamas. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1200.0s)]
*  You can argue that they're wrong, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1203.0s)]
*  but you can't argue that it's their responsibility. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1205.0s)]
*  Okay, let's bring Mustafa back in. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1208.0s)]
*  I don't accept that that is the only way Israel could have prosecuted this war. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1210.0s)]
*  I don't think destroying Gaza and killing tens of thousands of civilians... [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1213.0s)]
*  What could they have done? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1217.0s)]
*  ...was the only option they could have done. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1218.0s)]
*  I think it was driven by a rage. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1220.0s)]
*  What's the other option? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1222.0s)]
*  By the way, driven by an understandable rage after October 7th. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1223.0s)]
*  But that it's been completely disproportionate to what happened [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1227.0s)]
*  and completely alien to the way that Israel's conducted itself with other conflicts. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1230.0s)]
*  That's why I don't understand it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1235.0s)]
*  And that's why everyone hates it so much. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1236.0s)]
*  How many more people are going to get killed here? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1238.0s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1240.0s)]
*  Mustafa? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1241.0s)]
*  Well, there are so many points one has to speak about. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1243.0s)]
*  But first of all, let me remind you and your guests with the following. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1247.0s)]
*  According to World Health Organization, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1253.0s)]
*  Israel bombarded 94% of all hospitals in Gaza. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1256.0s)]
*  According to World Health Organization, Israel destroyed... [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1261.0s)]
*  I believe that because Hamas hides underneath that. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1266.0s)]
*  No, no, wait a minute. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1269.0s)]
*  Israel destroyed... [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1271.0s)]
*  Today they killed another medical doctor. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1272.0s)]
*  1,500 medical doctors, nurses and health professionals were killed. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1275.0s)]
*  Not a single foreign journalist was allowed into Gaza. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1280.0s)]
*  As human shields. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1284.0s)]
*  Shut up, please. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1285.0s)]
*  Not a single foreign journalist was allowed into Gaza. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1286.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1290.0s)]
*  Because they want to hide the truth. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1291.0s)]
*  That's a mistake. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1292.0s)]
*  228 Palestinian journalists were killed by Israel in this war. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1293.0s)]
*  While they were trying to report. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1303.0s)]
*  More than that, 700 medical centers and hospitals were destroyed by Israel, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1305.0s)]
*  including several clinics I am responsible for. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1312.0s)]
*  Where our medical teams work. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1315.0s)]
*  And they were completely destroyed. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1317.0s)]
*  One of our health workers, a lab technician who lived in a house with his family, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1320.0s)]
*  went out to buy products for his family if he could find products in the siege that is imposed in Gaza. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1326.0s)]
*  And then he came back to find that his wife, his daughter, his three sisters, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1332.0s)]
*  his two brothers and his mother were all killed in one hit. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1337.0s)]
*  Every day. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1341.0s)]
*  Who was underneath the house? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1343.0s)]
*  Who was using the house? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1344.0s)]
*  Nobody was. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1345.0s)]
*  Hamas was. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1346.0s)]
*  Nobody, nobody. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1347.0s)]
*  No, you can claim that all the time. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1348.0s)]
*  You've just heard reports that the Israeli pilots coming back from Iran, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1350.0s)]
*  who needed to get rid of the bombs they had in their planes still, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1355.0s)]
*  decided to go and throw them on Gaza without even having targets. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1359.0s)]
*  Oh, that is such that is such a lie. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1364.0s)]
*  This is this is a blood libel. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1366.0s)]
*  That's like denying the Holocaust. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1368.0s)]
*  You're saying that they dropped bombs on Gaza. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1370.0s)]
*  This is come on. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1374.0s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1375.0s)]
*  You can prove that by looking at the track of the tracking of the of the of the they didn't even fly over Gaza. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1376.0s)]
*  They went the other way. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1382.0s)]
*  It's just such a lie. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1384.0s)]
*  All right, Mustafa. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1386.0s)]
*  I have a question for you, Mustafa. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1387.0s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1389.0s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1391.0s)]
*  But let me finish. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1392.0s)]
*  But I have a question for you. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1393.0s)]
*  Israeli Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, not a Palestinian newspaper, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1395.0s)]
*  reported that the Israeli high ranking officers ordered their soldiers and officers to shoot people while they were trying to get humanitarian aid. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1399.0s)]
*  Almost 600 people were killed while they were trying to get humanitarian aid. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1409.0s)]
*  I want to go back to the bombs. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1412.0s)]
*  I want to go back to the. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1414.0s)]
*  I want to go back to the bombs being dropped. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1415.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1418.0s)]
*  And what the leader of Hamas was killed while he was fighting Israeli soldiers in the fact he was not killed or hiding. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1419.0s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1425.0s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1427.0s)]
*  I have a question, please. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1429.0s)]
*  I have a question for you, Mustafa. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1430.0s)]
*  Last time you came on, Mustafa, you said that all of the 50 hostages who were believed to have still not been released, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1432.0s)]
*  many of whom may, of course, sadly be dead. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1439.0s)]
*  But you said they were all IDF soldiers. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1442.0s)]
*  So we did some research into this and at least 15 of them were not IDF. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1445.0s)]
*  One worked as a massage therapist and a gardener in a kibbutz. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1450.0s)]
*  One was a software tester in a tech company. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1454.0s)]
*  One was a pianist with plans to study jazz in Tel Aviv. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1457.0s)]
*  One was an electrical engineer and so on. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1461.0s)]
*  You branding them all IDF soldiers was very disingenuous. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1463.0s)]
*  It wasn't true. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1467.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1469.0s)]
*  Didn't they all serve in the Israeli army? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1470.0s)]
*  Is that what you meant? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1473.0s)]
*  You said they were all IDF soldiers. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1475.0s)]
*  If they serve in the Israeli army, they are soldiers. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1478.0s)]
*  But as I just said to you, 15 of them were no longer. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1481.0s)]
*  They served in the Israeli army. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1484.0s)]
*  You can't target civilians who once served in the army. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1486.0s)]
*  You speak about the 50. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1489.0s)]
*  Hold on, please. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1491.0s)]
*  You know, it's really disgusting to have an interview with such a person. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1492.0s)]
*  Let him shut up, please. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1496.0s)]
*  There are 50 Israeli prisoners. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1499.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1502.0s)]
*  Some of them are killed. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1503.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, they will not be able to get back to their families. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1505.0s)]
*  Fine. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1508.0s)]
*  But do you accept that many of them were civilians when they were taken? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1509.0s)]
*  Nobody speaks. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1512.0s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1513.0s)]
*  Do you accept, Mustafa, do you accept that many of them were civilians [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1514.0s)]
*  when they were taken, not as you claim IDF soldiers? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1518.0s)]
*  My information is that they all have served in the Israeli army. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1522.0s)]
*  Well, that's very different because as you know, it's different [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1527.0s)]
*  because as you know, it is compulsory to serve young men and women [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1530.0s)]
*  in the IDF, but only for a certain period of time. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1534.0s)]
*  And 15 of the people who were taken out of those 50 were civilians [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1537.0s)]
*  when they were taken. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1542.0s)]
*  It makes a big difference in international law. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1543.0s)]
*  But there are other civilians who were taken, not only those, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1546.0s)]
*  if they are civilians. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1550.0s)]
*  But that's not the issue. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1551.0s)]
*  The issue is that besides the 50 Israeli prisoners, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1553.0s)]
*  there are now 10,600 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jail. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1556.0s)]
*  Why nobody speaks about them? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1561.0s)]
*  You know that out of them. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1562.0s)]
*  I speak about them. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1564.0s)]
*  They ought to remain in prison. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1565.0s)]
*  They're murderers. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1566.0s)]
*  They're rapists. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1567.0s)]
*  They're murderers. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1568.0s)]
*  They're terrorists. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1569.0s)]
*  They ought to be in prison. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1570.0s)]
*  I think the real terrorist is you and the real criminal is you [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1571.0s)]
*  and the real criminal who defends criminals and sex traffickers is you. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1576.0s)]
*  And you are the ones who defend people who have killed other people. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1581.0s)]
*  You are famous with that. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1584.0s)]
*  You defend the killers. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1585.0s)]
*  So shut up, please, and let me finish. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1587.0s)]
*  Out of the 10,600... [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1589.0s)]
*  What grounds do you have for calling Alan Dershowitz a terrorist? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1590.0s)]
*  Let me finish my point. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1593.0s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1594.0s)]
*  Sorry, Mustafa. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1595.0s)]
*  No, you can't get away with that. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1596.0s)]
*  What grounds do you have for calling Alan Dershowitz a terrorist? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1597.0s)]
*  Because he keeps defending terrorists. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1601.0s)]
*  He's a lawyer? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1604.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lawyer. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1606.0s)]
*  Are you saying every lawyer who defends anybody is a terrorist? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1608.0s)]
*  And he is that person? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1614.0s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1615.0s)]
*  Yeah, but he cannot say that the 10,600 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1616.0s)]
*  who are all civilians are terrorists. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1622.0s)]
*  I think you should withdraw your claim that Alan Dershowitz is a terrorist. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1624.0s)]
*  You should withdraw it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1630.0s)]
*  You talk about rudeness. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1632.0s)]
*  You should withdraw that claim that he is a terrorist. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1634.0s)]
*  He's not a terrorist. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1638.0s)]
*  And you are interrupting me, Pierce, and you are not letting me finish my point. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1640.0s)]
*  You're making outlandish claims about people being terrorists. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1643.0s)]
*  I think the person who defends terrorists acts against other people. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1646.0s)]
*  You think somebody who defends a terrorist as a lawyer is a terrorist? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1649.0s)]
*  What a ridiculous thing to say. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1653.0s)]
*  No, I didn't mean that if he is defending a terrorist in jail. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1654.0s)]
*  No, I meant he is defending terrorist policies that Smodric and Ben-Gavir... [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1658.0s)]
*  He literally said he hates Smodric and Ben-Gavir. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1663.0s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1667.0s)]
*  He literally said in this very debate that he hates Smodric and Ben-Gavir. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1668.0s)]
*  What more do you need? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1673.0s)]
*  And he said he's a friend of Netanyahu who killed 50,000 Palestinian children [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1675.0s)]
*  and injured 50,000 Palestinian children, right? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1679.0s)]
*  He's his friend. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1684.0s)]
*  Are you a friend of any members of Hamas? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1686.0s)]
*  I'm not friends with anybody. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1688.0s)]
*  I am going to tell you... [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1690.0s)]
*  Are you a friend of anybody in Hamas? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1692.0s)]
*  Are you a friend, Mustafa, by your yardstick? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1694.0s)]
*  Are you a friend of anybody in Hamas? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1697.0s)]
*  You are debating... [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1699.0s)]
*  First of all, you did not allow me to finish my sentence. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1701.0s)]
*  Are you a friend of anybody in Hamas? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1704.0s)]
*  I am not a friend of anybody without me finishing my... [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1706.0s)]
*  I will not answer your question until I finish my line. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1710.0s)]
*  My line is that... [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1713.0s)]
*  Are you a friend of anybody in Hamas? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1715.0s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1717.0s)]
*  I know people from Hamas. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1719.0s)]
*  OK, so does that make you a terrorist then? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1721.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1723.0s)]
*  Does that make you a terrorist? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1724.0s)]
*  No, no, of course not. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1725.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1726.0s)]
*  One rule for you, another rule for Alan Dershowitz. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1727.0s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1730.0s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1731.0s)]
*  I never defended... [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1732.0s)]
*  No, you want to be balanced in your approach? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1734.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1736.0s)]
*  I will take your language here. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1737.0s)]
*  I want you to be consistent. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1739.0s)]
*  Let me finish my line. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1741.0s)]
*  Let me finish my line. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1743.0s)]
*  My line was... [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1744.0s)]
*  There are 10,600 Palestinian prisoners today in Israeli jails. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1745.0s)]
*  Of them, 3,600 are people without charges, held without charges. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1750.0s)]
*  No legal process, no due legal process. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1757.0s)]
*  Their lawyers even don't know why they are in jail. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1761.0s)]
*  To me, these are captives. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1765.0s)]
*  Among them, there are 220 Palestinian children who are in Israeli jail. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1767.0s)]
*  Do you know, or your lawyer knows, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1772.0s)]
*  do you know that 660 Palestinian bodies are still held by the Israeli authorities? [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1776.0s)]
*  Some of them have been held by Israeli authorities. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1783.0s)]
*  I don't know what you call it, prison or grave prison. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1787.0s)]
*  You condemn that for more than 57 years. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1790.0s)]
*  Is that acceptable? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1796.0s)]
*  Are you willing to condemn Hamas? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1798.0s)]
*  Let Alan Dershowitz respond, please. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1800.0s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1803.0s)]
*  You can't just keep talking, Mustafa. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1804.0s)]
*  Let Alan respond. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1806.0s)]
*  No, last point. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1807.0s)]
*  We're running out of time, so I'll have to cut you off. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1809.0s)]
*  No, but one point. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1812.0s)]
*  Let's make a deal. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1813.0s)]
*  Let's make a deal here. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1815.0s)]
*  Let's make a deal. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1817.0s)]
*  Let's make a deal. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1819.0s)]
*  7th of October would not have happened if it was for the Israeli apartheid system. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1820.0s)]
*  7th of October would not have happened if there was no displacement of 70% of the Palestinian people [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1825.0s)]

*  Consider us, Palestinians, as equal human beings. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1833.0s)]
*  We are also entitled to proper life. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1837.0s)]
*  We don't want to kill anybody. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1840.0s)]
*  Can I respond, please? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1842.0s)]
*  I respect the history of those Jewish people who were persecuted by the Gestapo and by the Holocaust, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1844.0s)]
*  but I'm telling you, the Jewish people who were persecuted by the Holocaust, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1852.0s)]
*  by the criminals in the Nazi regime because there were so many cowardly people who stayed silent. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1858.0s)]
*  And today we see the same cowardness towards all these crimes that are happening. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1865.0s)]
*  You must let Alan respond. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1870.0s)]
*  So let me respond. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1872.0s)]
*  First of all, you're being a Holocaust denier by comparing the Holocaust to the self-inflicted boom. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1874.0s)]
*  Why am I mentioning the Holocaust? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1881.0s)]
*  The Palestinians, let me finish. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1882.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1884.0s)]
*  You're denying the Holocaust. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1885.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1887.0s)]
*  By claiming that there's an analogy between the Holocaust, 6 million people innocent killed, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1889.0s)]
*  and the self-inflicted boom, you say Palestinians were... [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1899.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1903.0s)]
*  Palestinians were forced to leave. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1904.0s)]
*  They were not forced to leave. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1906.0s)]
*  In 19... [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1908.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1909.0s)]
*  I'm going to finish. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1910.0s)]
*  You don't want to be interrupted, Mustafa, but you constantly interrupt. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1911.0s)]
*  It's not acceptable to conduct this discrimination. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1914.0s)]
*  Do you accept me as an equal human being to you? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1917.0s)]
*  You have to let me finish. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1920.0s)]
*  Not a single Palestinian would have been displaced had the Palestinian leadership accepted the UN offer [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1922.0s)]
*  of a partition plan where Israel was established, where there was a majority of Jews, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1930.0s)]
*  and a Palestinian state where there was a majority of Palestinians. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1936.0s)]
*  The Nakba was a self-inflicted boom. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1940.0s)]
*  Nobody would have been displaced. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1943.0s)]
*  The Palestinians would have had... [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1945.0s)]
*  You're not allowing me to speak. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1947.0s)]
*  You're claiming that I'm rude. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1949.0s)]
*  I'm not going to use that word because you've proved it yourself. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1951.0s)]
*  But the point is that if the Palestinians had simply said yes in 48, said yes in 67, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1955.0s)]
*  said yes 2000, 2001, said yes 2005, said yes 2007, there'd be no displaced people. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1963.0s)]
*  This is not me speaking. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1971.0s)]
*  This is Bill Clinton speaking. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1972.0s)]
*  These are the records. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1973.0s)]
*  These are the official records of the United Nations. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1975.0s)]
*  I helped to draft a little bit 267 of the United Nations, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1978.0s)]
*  which would have provided a basis for a two-state solution. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1983.0s)]
*  The Palestinian leadership said no because they did not want there to be a nation state of Jewish people. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1986.0s)]
*  That's their goal. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1993.0s)]
*  We've run out of time. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1994.0s)]
*  One minute, please. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1995.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Mustafa. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1997.0s)]
*  We've run out of time. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1998.0s)]
*  Just one thing. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=1999.0s)]
*  Israeli historians, Israeli historians, Abish Lime, an Israeli historian at Oxford. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2000.0s)]
*  He's a phony. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2006.0s)]
*  He's not an Israeli historian. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2007.0s)]
*  He's a pro-Palestinian shill. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2009.0s)]
*  There is no Israeli official document that shows that any Israeli government accepted the partition plan. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2012.0s)]
*  OK, you've responded. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2017.0s)]
*  That's the end of the debate. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2018.0s)]
*  I appreciate you both coming on. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2019.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming on Uncensored. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2021.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2023.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2024.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2025.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2026.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2027.0s)]
*  A few weeks ago, a nurse from Wales made global headlines after viral clips showed him begging Egyptian security forces to allow him and other humanitarian activists to cross the border into Gaza. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2028.0s)]
*  Allow us to march to Gaza. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2038.0s)]
*  We're peaceful people. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2041.0s)]
*  We're good people. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2042.0s)]
*  We're Muslims. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2043.0s)]
*  We're Christians. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2044.0s)]
*  We're atheists. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2045.0s)]
*  We're Jews. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2046.0s)]
*  We are humanity. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2048.0s)]
*  We are here for humanity. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2050.0s)]
*  What are you here for? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2052.0s)]
*  You don't have to do this. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2056.0s)]
*  You don't have to follow the orders. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2057.0s)]
*  Please, I'll go on to my knees and I will beg you. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2061.0s)]
*  Allow us to march to Palestine. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2064.0s)]
*  Please, you've got to listen to me. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2069.0s)]
*  Well, that nurse was Lee Evans. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2073.0s)]
*  He says he's previously worked as a nurse in Gaza. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2074.0s)]
*  He won many plaudits for sincerity, but also many detractors. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2076.0s)]
*  And this week, he divided the opinion again after being filmed outside the Senate in Wales, chanting this. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2079.0s)]
*  I will not be censored. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2085.0s)]
*  I will not be censored in my own country. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2087.0s)]
*  So death, death to the IDF. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2092.0s)]
*  Death, death to the IDF. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2095.0s)]
*  Well, Lee Evans joins me now. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2098.0s)]
*  Mr Evans, thank you very much indeed for joining me. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2100.0s)]
*  I just want to start with you chanting death to the IDF. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2102.0s)]
*  When you're campaigning to stop people being killed, why is it a good thing to then immediately yourself [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2106.0s)]
*  start to call for people to be killed? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2114.0s)]
*  Well, firstly, the IDF isn't a people. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2119.0s)]
*  Well, it is. It's a bunch of people in the army. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2122.0s)]
*  It's the militarised arm of a Zionist occupying force which facilitates apartheid and a starvation of 2 million people in Gaza. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2124.0s)]
*  But they're human beings. They are human beings. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2134.0s)]
*  Which you seem to be very, very appalled by. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2136.0s)]
*  Well, they're human beings. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2138.0s)]
*  No, no. Each individual soldier is a human being. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2140.0s)]
*  And I know a lot of them. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2143.0s)]
*  And I've worked with a lot of them that are now working to facilitate peace and the freedom of Palestine. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2145.0s)]
*  But nobody believes people. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2151.0s)]
*  It's a bit like the rapper at Glastonbury and now you. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2153.0s)]
*  When you say death to the IDF, everybody knows what you really mean. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2156.0s)]
*  And it's a call for IDF soldiers to be killed. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2159.0s)]
*  What else can it be saying? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2163.0s)]
*  The institution of the IDF should be dissolved, disseminated because I've been there many times. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2164.0s)]
*  And they are facilitating what I can only compare to Nazi Germany. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2173.0s)]
*  They are completely facilitating an apartheid. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2178.0s)]
*  They shoot innocent people. They shoot children. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2182.0s)]
*  So criticise them, but don't call for the. Don't chant death to the IDF. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2185.0s)]
*  Call for. Criticise the IDF. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2189.0s)]
*  I also chanted. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2191.0s)]
*  I also chanted death to the arms trade. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2193.0s)]
*  Now, the arms trade isn't a person either. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2196.0s)]
*  No, it's not. Obviously. Neither is the IDF. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2198.0s)]
*  Yeah, arms trade is not a person. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2200.0s)]
*  The IDF is the Israeli Defence Force made up of soldiers. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2202.0s)]
*  Everybody knows this. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2206.0s)]
*  The arms trade is made up for people who run businesses selling arms. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2209.0s)]
*  Right. You're perfectly entitled to your views. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2213.0s)]
*  I'm sure I agree with a lot of your views. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2216.0s)]
*  But when I hear people chanting death to other people, it negates the effect of your campaigning. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2219.0s)]
*  It makes me think you're just as bad as people you're campaigning against. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2225.0s)]
*  I understand the misperception. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2228.0s)]
*  But it's not a misperception, Lee, is it? Come on. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2231.0s)]
*  It's me you're talking to, not some clueless... [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2235.0s)]
*  And I've not talked to you before. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2238.0s)]
*  I know. It's good to have you on the programme. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2240.0s)]
*  And a lot of what you say and do, I have sympathy with. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2242.0s)]
*  But when I hear people try and pretend that when they chant death to... [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2245.0s)]
*  It's not when people chant death to America. What do they mean? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2249.0s)]
*  They mean death to Americans. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2252.0s)]
*  No, if you're not going to listen to my point, then there's not much I can say, is there? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2254.0s)]
*  The IDF is not a person. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2261.0s)]
*  And we have not named any individual soldier. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2264.0s)]
*  So would you say death to the British Army? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2268.0s)]
*  Would you chant death to the British Army? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2272.0s)]
*  Well, if I had cause... [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2276.0s)]
*  Well, we waged an illegal war in Iraq, for example. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2278.0s)]
*  Would you have chanted death to... Good point. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2281.0s)]
*  I actually went there as a nurse. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2283.0s)]
*  Right. So would you feel comfortable with people chanting death to the British Army, yes or no? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2285.0s)]
*  For the genocide that they've caused, yes. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2291.0s)]
*  And for the genocide that Britain has caused through history. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2294.0s)]
*  So you would now say death to the British Army. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2297.0s)]
*  No, that's what you're saying, Piers. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2300.0s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2302.0s)]
*  No, it's what you're saying. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2304.0s)]
*  Well, I thought you just said it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2305.0s)]
*  No, you just did. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2307.0s)]
*  So you wouldn't count on us chanting death to the British Army. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2309.0s)]
*  You think that's wrong? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2313.0s)]
*  It's not a constructive argument and you're not listening to what I'm saying. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2314.0s)]
*  Well, it is, because the British Army... [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2316.0s)]
*  The British Army, and I campaigned against this at the Daily Mirror, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2318.0s)]
*  the British Army waged an illegal war in Iraq, which was completely wrong, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2321.0s)]
*  which caused mayhem, the rise of ISIS, the deaths of a million people. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2325.0s)]
*  But I had a brother who served in the British Army, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2329.0s)]
*  and I would have taken grave exception to anybody chanting death to the British Army, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2332.0s)]
*  because I would have taken that as a direct threat to kill my brother, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2336.0s)]
*  who was serving his country, and would have been imprisoned if he deserted his position. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2340.0s)]
*  So this is my point about this. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2344.0s)]
*  This casual use of chanting is actually quite dangerous, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2346.0s)]
*  and in the wrong people's voices and impressionable heads, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2350.0s)]
*  it can lead to people actually thinking what you mean is killing human beings. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2353.0s)]
*  And I just don't see how that helps a campaign to stop human beings being killed. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2358.0s)]
*  OK, I can see your perspective and I can see the line of thought that you're going down. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2363.0s)]
*  My initial thoughts when I first heard that chant were that I found it very, very strange [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2369.0s)]
*  that somebody chanting death to the IDF, which isn't an individual person, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2375.0s)]
*  can upset the Western media so much that they have... [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2380.0s)]
*  It's a five-day debate on it, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2385.0s)]
*  whereas the IDF caused the actual death of hundreds of thousands of innocent Palestinian... [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2388.0s)]
*  Why can't they both be wrong? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2394.0s)]
*  Why can't both those things be wrong at the same time? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2396.0s)]
*  Absolutely. The violent loss of any life is wrong. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2399.0s)]
*  You didn't feel uncomfortable with thousands of people at a music festival, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2402.0s)]
*  ironically a music festival, and I say ironically because of what happened on October 7, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2408.0s)]
*  where hundreds of innocent young Israelis enjoying a music festival were slaughtered by a terrorist group, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2413.0s)]
*  that thousands of people in an audience at an English music festival [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2420.0s)]
*  joined in a chant of death to the IDF and you have no problem with that. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2426.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that I haven't got a problem with it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2431.0s)]
*  You don't have a problem with it. You did it yourself yesterday. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2434.0s)]
*  You don't have a problem with it. You did it yourself yesterday. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2438.0s)]
*  Yes, because I believe that the IDF should be dissolved, should die, should no longer exist. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2441.0s)]
*  Now, you know what, Lee? Say that. That's fine. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2448.0s)]
*  Criticise the IDF as much as you like. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2451.0s)]
*  Say that a lot of what they're doing in Gaza now is unacceptable, indefensible, as I've been saying. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2453.0s)]
*  Not just in Gaza, in the whole of Palestine. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2458.0s)]
*  But when you incite a chant in front of thousands of people of death to the IDF, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2460.0s)]
*  many people assume it means death to the members of the IDF or human beings. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2465.0s)]
*  You may not like them, you may not like what they do, their order to do it by their government. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2470.0s)]
*  And I just feel like it doesn't help the cause when you're trying to stop the killing to just call for killing. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2475.0s)]
*  That's my point. I wasn't calling for killing. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2481.0s)]
*  I was calling for the death of the IDF, which aren't individual people. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2483.0s)]
*  I think it's a convene... I think... [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2487.0s)]
*  Which also isn't... I think, Lee, in all honesty, I think it's an excuse that everyone's latched onto [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2489.0s)]
*  when they saw what had happened to this rapper at Glastonbury. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2495.0s)]
*  And even he's now joined in by saying, that's what he really meant. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2499.0s)]
*  And I don't believe him. And I don't believe you. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2503.0s)]
*  But listen, in other areas of what you've been saying, I have a lot of sympathy. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2505.0s)]
*  But I appreciate you joining me on Uncensored. Thank you very much. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2509.0s)]
*  I appreciate you giving me the chance. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2512.0s)]
*  I've been on television all over the world since my impassioned appeal to the Egyptian police. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2514.0s)]
*  But none in Britain have even asked me a word about what I did. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2520.0s)]
*  Well, I've had you on, and I appreciate... [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2525.0s)]
*  I know. I admire your intestinal fortitude for it. I really do. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2527.0s)]
*  It doesn't take that. I like to have everybody on. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2531.0s)]
*  And I like to have vigorous debate. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2533.0s)]
*  And look, some stuff I'm sure you and I would agree about, and some stuff we wouldn't. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2535.0s)]
*  But I've got to leave it there, Lee. Thank you very much. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2539.0s)]
*  I'm being joined now by the columnist, political commentator Owen Jones, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2541.0s)]
*  somebody else who I suspect on this issue of what the IDF is doing in Gaza, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2544.0s)]
*  that we'd have a lot of agreement on. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2547.0s)]
*  But you and I locked horns a little bit on X a couple of days ago [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2549.0s)]
*  about what happened at Glastonbury. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2552.0s)]
*  I just felt... [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2554.0s)]
*  Owen, when people try and pretend what they mean is, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2555.0s)]
*  well, we just mean the entity. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2558.0s)]
*  We don't actually mean IDF soldiers. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2560.0s)]
*  It's disingenuous. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2562.0s)]
*  When a crowd charts death to the IDF, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2564.0s)]
*  what they mean is they think IDF soldiers should be killed. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2566.0s)]
*  People talk about the death of institutions all the time. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2569.0s)]
*  Keir Starmer, when he said the NHS must reform or die, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2571.0s)]
*  did he mean, and maybe you should probably give a bit of warning [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2574.0s)]
*  to doctors, nurses and patients around the world, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2577.0s)]
*  does he literally mean they're going to be killed? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2579.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2581.0s)]
*  So, sorry, just to be clear, then. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2582.0s)]
*  You're comparing... You think that the NHS... [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2584.0s)]
*  So, when people say the NHS will die, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2586.0s)]
*  literally they say the NHS will die without reform, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2588.0s)]
*  are they saying that they're going to be the mass murder of doctors and patients? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2591.0s)]
*  So, to be clear, when you watch that rapper at Glastonbury [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2595.0s)]
*  chanting and leading a chant with thousands joining in [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2598.0s)]
*  of death to the IDF, you instinctively believe... [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2601.0s)]
*  He said it himself. He said it. I know, he said it since. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2604.0s)]
*  Well, no, no, no. Yes, you're right. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2606.0s)]
*  Look, unlike you and I, we're both very verbose commentators. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2608.0s)]
*  Correct. Let's be honest. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2611.0s)]
*  We write at length, sometimes in pithier tweets, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2613.0s)]
*  but I like to write at length what I think. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2615.0s)]
*  And I think the IDF should be dismantled. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2617.0s)]
*  That's fine. Yeah, ah. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2619.0s)]
*  But he said himself it means the dismantling of a violent... [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2620.0s)]
*  He said it since the Fiori blow-up. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2622.0s)]
*  But he also said he's opposed to the death of Jews, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2624.0s)]
*  Arabs or any other race or group of people. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2626.0s)]
*  I don't want to be rude, but that puts him in a rather different [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2628.0s)]
*  category than your pro is. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2631.0s)]
*  Hang on, when did he post that? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2633.0s)]
*  Well, the next day. Of course. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2635.0s)]
*  What do you mean, of course? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2637.0s)]
*  It wasn't the next day, it was the day after. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2639.0s)]
*  So you're saying that a rapper should have done [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2641.0s)]
*  a long verbose statement on stage? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2643.0s)]
*  Let's just be honest. Hang on, hang on. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2645.0s)]
*  Let me respond. His initial response the next day [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2647.0s)]
*  was not to apologise for anything, to cite his daughter [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2649.0s)]
*  and school meals. He shouldn't apologise. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2653.0s)]
*  That's fine, he doesn't have to. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2655.0s)]
*  Free speech business doesn't have to. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2657.0s)]
*  But he was dropped by his talent agency, he had his visa revoked [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2659.0s)]
*  so he can't go on the tour he was planning in the United States. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2662.0s)]
*  And then we saw this clarification, which bore a striking resemblance [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2665.0s)]
*  to what people who tried to justify it had been saying on social media, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2669.0s)]
*  which is, I didn't mean soldiers, I meant just the institution. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2673.0s)]
*  Can I put this in? Honestly, I'm interested to see what you think. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2677.0s)]
*  Because, you know, I'll come on to the false equivalence you also made. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2680.0s)]
*  If the Russian army on Friday, if Russian officers and soldiers [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2684.0s)]
*  had confessed that they had been ordered to deliberately shoot [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2688.0s)]
*  Ukrainian civilians, they had been ordered to starve already, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2692.0s)]
*  they'd put a total siege on Ukraine for several months, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2696.0s)]
*  they had been ordered to shoot dead those unarmed, starving civilians, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2699.0s)]
*  and they had killed over 600 of them, including an 18-month-old girl [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2704.0s)]
*  who they shot in the chest, and then the next day, having seen those reports, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2707.0s)]
*  people talking about the death of the Russian army, would you honestly, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2711.0s)]
*  and you really do need to answer honestly here, and I want to just say [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2714.0s)]
*  it from the heart, would you honestly regard that as an outrage, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2717.0s)]
*  or would you regard that as an obvious emotional response to an [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2721.0s)]
*  absolutely unbelievable war crime? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2725.0s)]
*  Right, so you accept then that the rapper was talking about soldiers? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2728.0s)]
*  No. People call for the death of the Russian army all the time. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2731.0s)]
*  Do you believe him 100%? Yes. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2734.0s)]
*  When he said death to the IDF, he didn't mean individuals? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2737.0s)]
*  Did you believe that? Well, he's actually unlike... [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2740.0s)]
*  This is the irony. Do you know what the irony is? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2743.0s)]
*  Well, just answer my question first. Yes, I do. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2745.0s)]
*  I want to read you something. I want to read you something. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2747.0s)]
*  Because new footage has emerged and circulated today of Bob Bylan [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2750.0s)]
*  saying on stage, villain, death to every single IDF soldier, May 2025. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2755.0s)]
*  To be honest, I mean, I don't know about that footage, I haven't seen it, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2764.0s)]
*  to be honest, that still puts him, I'm afraid to say he appears, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2767.0s)]
*  in a better category than most of your pro-villain guests. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2771.0s)]
*  But he's completely contradicted everything you've just said. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2774.0s)]
*  I'm not Bob Bylan's spokesperson. By the way, I'm not playing [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2777.0s)]
*  Godshit, I just got told that myself. No, fair enough. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2780.0s)]
*  They've literally put it on the iPad, because it's gone round today. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2782.0s)]
*  Fair enough. I would never, myself... [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2785.0s)]
*  Clearly, that shows his actual meaning was not what he put as an [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2787.0s)]
*  excuse two days later. What he meant was death to every single IDF soldier. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2791.0s)]
*  So then the argument becomes, you're one about the Russian troops in Ukraine, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2796.0s)]
*  and my point is, coming from a family full of military, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2800.0s)]
*  military do the orders of their government. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2803.0s)]
*  Often on pain of imprisonment. I'm afraid to say. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2806.0s)]
*  You may want to say that that's not the case, but actually an army goes [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2809.0s)]
*  into battle, the orders... When we went into war against Iraq in 2003, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2813.0s)]
*  many of those soldiers would have had serious misgivings. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2818.0s)]
*  So who is accountable? Tony Blair, who orders them in. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2821.0s)]
*  Or the soldiers who do their job. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2825.0s)]
*  We established at Nuremberg that I was just following orders is not a [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2827.0s)]
*  legal excuse. You're absolutely right. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2832.0s)]
*  The perpetrators of genocide should be hauled before the courts. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2834.0s)]
*  That's principally the likes of Benjamin Netanyahu and those at the [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2838.0s)]
*  top. But Israeli soldiers who are massacring knowingly unarmed [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2842.0s)]
*  civilians, it doesn't matter. They are legally required, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2846.0s)]
*  strictly, they are legally required to refuse to enact those orders. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2849.0s)]
*  People like myself oppose sending IDF soldiers into Gaza. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2852.0s)]
*  If that had happened, not only would hundreds of thousands of [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2856.0s)]
*  Palestinians lives be saved and not maimed and all the rest, but those [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2860.0s)]
*  hundreds of Israeli soldiers wouldn't have been killed either. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2865.0s)]
*  A lot of your guests, ironically the pro-Israel guests, supported [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2868.0s)]
*  sending hundreds of IDF soldiers to their deaths in pursuit of what is [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2872.0s)]
*  a genocide. Out of interest, what would you have done on October 8 [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2876.0s)]
*  if you had been Israel? What would you have done if you were [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2880.0s)]
*  Palestinians on the 7th of October? 3000 terrorists have come over the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2884.0s)]
*  border, they have annihilated 1200 people, they have captured 250-plus [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2888.0s)]
*  hostages, 7000 people were wounded, many of them with irrevocable [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2892.0s)]
*  injuries. What would you have done? The problem with this is you're [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2897.0s)]
*  saying if I was in apartheid state which had deliberately and [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2901.0s)]
*  systematically... If I was Israel, I would create a terrorist group, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2905.0s)]
*  I would create a single state. What would you have done? Nothing. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2909.0s)]
*  What I would have done is, if I was suddenly the Israeli state, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2913.0s)]
*  probably what I would have done is dealt with the underlying causes of [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2917.0s)]
*  what happened. You wouldn't have responded to that? You would send [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2921.0s)]
*  the soldiers in the here and now to prevent civilians on the borders. On [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2925.0s)]
*  the borders they failed to defend because they were in the West Bank [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2929.0s)]
*  committing a pogrom at the time. You wouldn't have gone after the people [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2933.0s)]
*  who were there. The international criminal... Do you believe that [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2937.0s)]
*  Israel had a right to defend itself? Gaza, as you know, under international [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2941.0s)]
*  law, wasn't another state. It's occupied legally as per international law. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2945.0s)]
*  But all the terrorists came from Gaza? Yes. Did Israel have a right to [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2949.0s)]
*  defend itself? Do you know why I regard this as so offensive to the [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2953.0s)]
*  worth of Palestinian life? I'll tell you why. In 2020... Do you think [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2957.0s)]
*  Hamas cared about the lives of Palestinians? No, I haven't argued [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2962.0s)]
*  that. We don't have to 632 days into genocide, have to start going back [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2966.0s)]
*  to do you condemn Hamas? You know my views on that. That wasn't my [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2970.0s)]
*  question. I said do you think Hamas cared about the lives of Palestinians [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2974.0s)]
*  when they launched that attack, having built an intricate tunnel system [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2978.0s)]
*  which protected Hamas but exposed the civilians to certain death? I don't [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2982.0s)]
*  support that. I don't support that. I don't support that. I don't support [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2986.0s)]
*  that. I don't support that. Again, why Hamas is not relevant. Of course [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2991.0s)]
*  they're relevant. I'll tell you why it's not relevant, I'll tell you why [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2995.0s)]
*  you would find this question offensive if I had put it to you. If I had [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=2999.0s)]
*  said to you in 2023 240 Palestinians had been killed that year by the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3003.0s)]
*  Israeli state, including 40 children, what else was Hamas supposed to do [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3007.0s)]
*  on 7 October? What would you say? Are you justified? No, that's the point. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3011.0s)]
*  That's the point. I'm saying you would say correctly there was never any [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3015.0s)]
*  excuse for war crimes. This is an outrageous question for you too. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3018.36s)]
*  Responding to a terror attack isn't a war crime. What has happened in the [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3022.6s)]
*  last few months to me has now crossed the line between legitimate [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3026.52s)]
*  self-defence to the worst terror attack of modern times against the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3030.08s)]
*  Jewish people, has gone a mile past that into, and clearly from what [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3034.24s)]
*  people like Smodridge are saying, has gone into a plan, it seems to me, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3038.8s)]
*  by the government to cleanse Gaza of Palestinians, which is a war [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3042.64s)]
*  crime. It's so easy if you say Smodridge is your bogeyman. Yeah? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3046.48s)]
*  Yeah. Because he says it on camera. No-one doubts that Smodridge and [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3050.16s)]
*  Ben-Gavir are deeply impetuous mass-murdering genocidal mania. Well, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3054.16s)]
*  people do deny it, unfortunately a lot of people come to your show, but [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3058.4s)]
*  who should be in prison? OK? From the very beginning, Israeli leaders and [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3060.7999999999997s)]
*  officials made clear they were going to commit a genocide. They made [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3064.3599999999997s)]
*  clear they saw no distinction between civilians and people. And the [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3067.3599999999997s)]
*  problem is, people like yourself now, you're literally fuelling a [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3071.3199999999997s)]
*  continuing campaign about a rapper and what he said on stage when... [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3074.48s)]
*  Well, a rapper you've defended, because you said he only meant the [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3079.4s)]
*  entity, and as we've now discovered, he said he meant death to every [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3081.68s)]
*  single IDF soldier. You got that at the same time as I did, so how much [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3085.92s)]
*  space for a response... But given that, do you now accept that your [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3090.12s)]
*  defence of him was a little bit wrong? I support... Well, let's watch the [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3092.96s)]
*  clip. Here. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3096.52s)]
*  ..to every single IDF soldier out there, as an agent of terror for [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3099.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3103.56s)]
*  APPLAUSE [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3105.0s)]
*  I've known you a long time, I have a lot of respect for you. You just [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3108.96s)]
*  have to admit, when you hear that, you were wrong to defend him in the [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3113.2s)]
*  way you defended him. He didn't mean IDF... The people I was defending... [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3116.76s)]
*  He didn't mean IDF-y entity, did he? But do you accept now that you were [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3119.72s)]
*  wrong? He didn't mean that. We both... I didn't hear, I've only heard for [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3122.6s)]
*  the first time. You've heard that. Now you've heard that, do you still [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3126.48s)]
*  say he only meant the entity? No, obviously now he's made clear what he [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3129.1200000000003s)]
*  meant. So you accept you were wrong? Yeah, because obviously... I know, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3132.28s)]
*  I'm not saying you should have known. Fine. I'm just saying that I found [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3135.1600000000003s)]
*  the defence very disingenuous by everybody, and I felt what he'd done, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3139.36s)]
*  and this has now been proven, I think, he'd gone on social media, he'd [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3144.6800000000003s)]
*  seen people coming up with this ludicrous... But this is what... He [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3148.0400000000004s)]
*  only meant the entity, and then, knowing what he'd said on stage, so [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3150.88s)]
*  knowing what he'd said on stage, he issued a statement saying the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3154.8399999999997s)]
*  complete opposite that he's read from people like you defending him. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3157.56s)]
*  Now he's made all of you look like complete prunes. No, the people I'm [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3160.3599999999997s)]
*  defending principally are the people in the audience. I do not believe [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3164.24s)]
*  thousands of people attending Glastonbury were supporting that. And [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3166.56s)]
*  what I find, actually, even more grotesque, to be honest, and this is [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3169.68s)]
*  what I find grotesque, that view, which I don't support, I don't support [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3173.12s)]
*  killing anyone, which is what IDF soldiers shouldn't be sent... So [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3176.7999999999997s)]
*  then we agree. Shouldn't be sent into Gaza... Then we agree. To kill [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3179.24s)]
*  and therefore we kill. Hang on, let me agree. No, your guests... You [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3182.4399999999996s)]
*  don't believe in killing, I agree with you. Your guests, who you treat [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3185.3999999999996s)]
*  as respectable people who come on the show, have more extreme views than [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3189.48s)]
*  he does. On which side? Because they are pro-Israel. But what about the [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3192.68s)]
*  pro-Palestinian guests I've had on, who the Israelis say are the most [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3196.52s)]
*  extreme people in the world? The war crimes being committed... You only [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3199.7999999999997s)]
*  care about extremists on one side? No. Sorry. Because I don't. I care [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3202.9199999999996s)]
*  about extremists on both sides. The war crimes being committed by [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3206.8799999999997s)]
*  Israel are infinitely worse. They're more hamasted? Absolutely. OK. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3208.68s)]
*  How many people have been killed in Gaza? How many people? Depending [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3212.88s)]
*  on what report you believe, between 50,000 and 70,000 have been [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  killed. Absolutely not. The Economist, for example... I've seen those [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3219.2400000000002s)]
*  reports. No, we support the onslaught of 109,000 people. These are [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3222.04s)]
*  unsubstantiated numbers. Under international law... It is generally [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3226.84s)]
*  recognised by the international community that it's between 50,000 [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3229.44s)]
*  and 70,000. No, it isn't. What are you talking about? It is. Absolutely [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3232.04s)]
*  not. Sorry. The international community is the international [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3234.32s)]
*  community. The economic community is the people who are supporting [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3237.4s)]
*  Israel as it commits genocide. The Economist supported Israel's [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3240.4s)]
*  onslaught. 109,000, that's just violent deaths. We know from other [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3243.4s)]
*  conflicts, this isn't a conflict, this is genocide, the vast majority [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3246.4s)]
*  of people die from non-violent causes. Now, the reason what he said, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3249.4s)]
*  which I do not support, by the way, there, is... Well, that's good. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3253.4s)]
*  Less extreme than your guests is under international law, it's legal [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3256.4s)]
*  to kill competence. It is not legal to kill civilians either because of [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3261.4s)]
*  disproportionate actions intentionally or recklessly. Your guests [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3265.4s)]
*  who come on this show, who are pro-Israel guests, they support an [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3268.4s)]
*  onslaught which doesn't just kill competence but kills civilians. That [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3272.4s)]
*  is more extreme than what that man said. But you don't treat them as [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3276.4s)]
*  that. Why don't you treat those people as more extreme than that man? [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3280.4s)]
*  Why? You've talked for a long time. I mean, I think we actually agree. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3284.4s)]
*  You just don't want to admit we agree. No, you don't accept the idea for [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3287.4s)]
*  doing it. You don't accept it. As you know, I have said very publicly [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3291.4s)]
*  now for many weeks, in fact, since the start of the year, that what [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3295.4s)]
*  Israel's been doing in Gaza in the last few months... Is it genocide? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3299.4s)]
*  I don't think it is genocide. This is a real problem. Hang on. No, it's [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3303.4s)]
*  not a problem. It is a problem. Hang on. I'm not a genocide denier. You [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3307.4s)]
*  are. Do you think Israel's committing genocide? Yes or no? Do you know [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3311.4s)]
*  what genocide is? Yes, I do know. What do you think it is? Genocide is [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3315.4s)]
*  not a question of what is happening. It is a question of whether we are [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3319.4s)]
*  clean, or clean and whole or in part. Do you not think that's what [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3323.4s)]
*  happens when Palestinians are gone? Do you think they are trying to kill [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3326.4s)]
*  every Palestinian? That's not the definition of genocide. Which genocide [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3330.4s)]
*  is every single person being killed? I think what is happening is more [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3334.4s)]
*  ethnic cleansing. It's how I would describe it. We can disagree. No, no, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3338.4s)]
*  no. You can disagree. A lot of people think it is genocide. It is not [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3342.4s)]
*  a question of what is happening. It is a question of what it is to do [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3346.4s)]
*  that. I would call it what Smodrich is talking about is ethnic cleansing. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3350.4s)]
*  A consensus of genocide scholars believe Israel is committing genocide. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3354.4s)]
*  That includes Israeli scholars of genocide, Omar Batov. He is a [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3358.4s)]
*  professor of genocide in Holocaust. This is what I'm going to ask you. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3362.4s)]
*  We are talking about experts. Many experts say it isn't. Let me quickly, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3366.4s)]
*  Omar Batov, Raz Sigal, these are only Israeli genocide scholars. Amos [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3370.4s)]
*  Batov is the head of the Institute for the Reconciliation of Israel. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3375.4s)]
*  He is the head of the Institute. What is the ICC? The ICC is still [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3379.4s)]
*  investigating. What is it saying? They have been ordered not to release [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3383.4s)]
*  any future charges. It has not declared genocide. I agree with that. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3387.4s)]
*  Can you give me a single genocide scholar who thinks this isn't genocide? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3394.4s)]
*  Let me get a word in. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3400.4s)]
*  OK. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3402.36s)]
*  My biggest problem with all of this is that you and I can argue [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3403.36s)]
*  the toss about numbers and this and that, scale and genocide, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3406.52s)]
*  the ethnic cleansing and so on. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3409.92s)]
*  The reason we don't know more about how to assess this is because [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3411.64s)]
*  British and international journalists have not been allowed [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3416.4s)]
*  into Gaza to do their job. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3419.56s)]
*  On that, I think we completely agree, right? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3420.96s)]
*  If the international journalists were allowed in, they could get [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3423.2000000000003s)]
*  to the bottom of all this stuff. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3425.6s)]
*  I think when they finally get in, we are going to find evidence [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3426.88s)]
*  of appalling war crimes. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3429.92s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3431.32s)]
*  I believe that is why the Israeli government continues to ban [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3432.44s)]
*  international journalists. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3436.0800000000004s)]
*  So it may well be that when the journalists get in, that you and I [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3437.1600000000003s)]
*  meet again and I say to you, I believe the bar for genocide was [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3441.04s)]
*  met. At the moment, I don't. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3445.4s)]
*  So can I... [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3447.88s)]
*  I believe... [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3448.88s)]
*  So, Piers, Piers, Piers, Piers, can I just ask you, can I ask you, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3449.88s)]
*  you spoke for a long time there. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3452.76s)]
*  I've read several genocide scholars, there's a consensus of [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3454.1200000000003s)]
*  genocide scholars who believe this is genocide. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3458.04s)]
*  I'm asking you to name me one genocide scholar. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3460.16s)]
*  Well, I'll just name the ICC who have not ruled that yet. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3462.36s)]
*  We don't know that. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3464.7200000000003s)]
*  We do. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3465.7200000000003s)]
*  Sorry, the ICC, just quickly, is this true or not? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3466.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you know this? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3469.96s)]
*  The ICC have ordered any future charges cannot be made public. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3471.04s)]
*  We don't know what other charges they've made. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3477.4s)]
*  The bar for genocide, because of intent, is much higher. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3479.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3482.32s)]
*  Now, so we don't know what charges they're going to make. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3483.32s)]
*  So we don't know it's genocide yet? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3485.28s)]
*  Well... [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3486.8399999999997s)]
*  You just admitted it? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3487.8399999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3488.8399999999997s)]
*  Or did you not? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3489.8399999999997s)]
*  It takes years, that process. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3490.8399999999997s)]
*  The legal process takes years. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3491.8399999999997s)]
*  Right, so why don't we wait for that to determine when it's genocide? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3492.8399999999997s)]
*  Because we can rely on the evidence of genocide scholars who [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3495.24s)]
*  dedicate their lives. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3497.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you think you know better than genocide scholars? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3498.7599999999998s)]
*  You think the scholars know more than the ICC? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3501.24s)]
*  Maybe they do. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3503.24s)]
*  No, we don't, because the ICC takes years. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3504.24s)]
*  It's clearly an arguable point. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3505.24s)]
*  Well, it isn't, because the ICC take years. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3507.04s)]
*  That legal process takes years. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3509.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, for example, on the night... [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3511.7599999999998s)]
*  This is, again, on the 9th of October, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3513.64s)]
*  the head of Kogut, the Israeli general in charge of Kogut, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3517.16s)]
*  he said... [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3520.16s)]
*  This is... [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3521.16s)]
*  Sorry, the Major General Gassanalli. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3522.16s)]
*  He said Hamas has become ISIS. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3524.16s)]
*  He said, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3526.16s)]
*  The citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of condemning. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3527.16s)]
*  Human beasts will be dealt with accordingly. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3530.16s)]
*  You will get no water or energy, just damage. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3533.16s)]
*  You asked for hell, you wanted hell. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3536.16s)]
*  That tweet was addressed, it was a video, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3538.16s)]
*  the tweet was addressed to Hamas and the residents of Gaza. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3540.16s)]
*  Do you accept that's genocidal? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3543.16s)]
*  I don't want to go into what I've said repeatedly. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3545.8799999999997s)]
*  Why is that not genocidal? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3548.8799999999997s)]
*  It's genocidal language. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3550.8799999999997s)]
*  OK, so he's the... Who is he? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3552.8799999999997s)]
*  He's the IDF general. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3554.8799999999997s)]
*  Smatresk is the leading member of the government. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3556.8799999999997s)]

*  I don't dispute that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3560.8799999999997s)]
*  So you accept intent is that? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3562.8799999999997s)]
*  You're asking me... [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3564.8799999999997s)]
*  You ask me, do I believe yet it is genocide? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3566.8799999999997s)]
*  I do not. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3568.8799999999997s)]
*  Do you believe there is genocidal intent? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3570.8799999999997s)]
*  I believe there's genocidal rhetoric. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3572.8799999999997s)]
*  So what do you think? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3575.6s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3577.6s)]
*  Do you believe there is a difference between genocide and [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3579.6s)]
*  ethnic cleansing? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3582.6s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing is the removal of people from the land on the basis [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3584.6s)]
*  of ethnicity. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3587.6s)]
*  Genocide is when you attempt to destroy people in whole or in [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3589.6s)]
*  part. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3592.6s)]
*  You don't need to kill people to do that. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3594.6s)]
*  So by your definition, Srebrenica... [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3596.6s)]
*  So there's not a lot of difference. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3598.6s)]
*  Do you think Srebrenica wasn't a genocide? [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3600.6s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3603.3199999999997s)]
*  It was a dedicated genocide. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3605.3199999999997s)]
*  It's not genocide according to you. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3607.3199999999997s)]
*  Let's stick on this. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3609.3199999999997s)]
*  I have said I believe that Smodrich is planning ethnic cleansing. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3611.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe what is happening here. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3613.3199999999997s)]
*  You think it's genocide what's going on. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3615.3199999999997s)]
*  I think it is ethnic cleansing is the plan. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3617.3199999999997s)]
*  There's not a lot of difference between them. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3619.3199999999997s)]
*  You accept that? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3621.3199999999997s)]
*  Genocide means... [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3623.3199999999997s)]
*  So you think I'm denying genocide. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3625.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm saying I think the borough has been met for me of ethnic [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3627.3199999999997s)]
*  cleansing. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3630.3199999999997s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing doesn't actually have legal standing. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3633.04s)]
*  It's a term which was used... [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3635.04s)]
*  It's a war crime. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3637.04s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3639.04s)]
*  It is a war crime. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3641.04s)]
*  The term ethnic cleansing doesn't exist as legal language. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3643.04s)]
*  You're talking about forcible displacement of people from the [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3645.04s)]
*  homes. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3648.04s)]
*  That's a war crime. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3650.04s)]
*  By your definition, Srebrenica, which by the way lots of Israeli [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3652.04s)]
*  leaders claim isn't genocide, they were allied many of them to the [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3655.04s)]
*  Bosnian Serbs who had huge amounts of sympathy for, they said it [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3658.04s)]
*  was a genocide. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3661.7599999999998s)]
*  I believe it was. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you think the Rohingya, is that genocide in Burma? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3665.7599999999998s)]
*  They haven't exterminated the Rohingya. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3667.7599999999998s)]
*  I prefer to wait. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3669.7599999999998s)]
*  You're right. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3671.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm getting excited. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3673.7599999999998s)]
*  You're nervous, aren't you? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3675.7599999999998s)]
*  Very excited. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3677.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's conclude with things we agree about. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3679.7599999999998s)]
*  Is your position now about Bob Villain, given what we just [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3681.7599999999998s)]
*  watched, that when he chants death to every single IDF soldier, you [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3683.7599999999998s)]
*  would condemn that? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3686.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't support... [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3688.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't support soldiers to be killed. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3691.48s)]
*  The way to stop that is to stop IDF soldiers committing genocide. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3693.48s)]
*  Just to clarify, in light of what we've just seen, would you now [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3696.48s)]
*  withdraw your defence that he was only talking about IDFing an [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3699.48s)]
*  entity? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3702.48s)]
*  His statement was obviously not correct. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3704.48s)]
*  He didn't say that. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3706.48s)]
*  You wish you hadn't defended him now? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3708.48s)]
*  I wouldn't have defended him on the basis of his statement. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3710.48s)]
*  You said he was only specifically talking about the entity. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3713.48s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3716.48s)]
*  He lied to you, didn't he? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3718.48s)]
*  He's less extreme than most of your guests. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3721.2s)]
*  That's not a different argument. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3723.2s)]
*  It isn't. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3725.2s)]
*  You don't show... [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3727.2s)]
*  Have you watched me taking on the Israeli guests? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3729.2s)]
*  You treat those Israeli guests as having respectable views. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3731.2s)]
*  You always have. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3734.2s)]
*  Have you watched him the last few months? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3736.2s)]
*  Have you watched the show? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3738.2s)]
*  I don't think you've been watching the show, have you? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3740.2s)]
*  Why don't you ask Israeli Twitter, or Zionist Twitter, what they [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3742.2s)]
*  think of what I've been doing on my show? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3745.2s)]
*  All the way through. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3747.2s)]
*  You would know exactly how I've been treating the pro-Israel [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3749.9199999999996s)]
*  government guests. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3752.9199999999996s)]
*  In the first month. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3754.9199999999996s)]
*  You haven't watched, have you? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3756.9199999999996s)]
*  I've watched many of your guests who are pro-Israel. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3758.9199999999996s)]
*  Did you watch the interview with the Israeli ambassador? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3760.9199999999996s)]
*  She's very easily upset. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3763.9199999999996s)]
*  She's very easy to set her off. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3765.9199999999996s)]
*  The lawyers for Israel, Natasha Hausdorff? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3767.9199999999996s)]
*  I've seen you. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3769.9199999999996s)]
*  Did you watch the interview with the Minister this week? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3771.9199999999996s)]
*  I've seen you from the beginning. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3773.9199999999996s)]
*  Interview pro-Israel guests and treat them with deference and [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3775.9199999999996s)]
*  respect. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3779.64s)]
*  These are people who support killing civilians, not soldiers. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3781.64s)]
*  I've also treated... [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3784.64s)]
*  It's illegal to kill soldiers, not to kill civilians. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3786.64s)]
*  Sorry, illegal to kill soldiers, not to kill civilians. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3789.64s)]
*  Had you watched the show for the last few weeks or months? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3792.64s)]
*  I don't watch everyone. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3795.64s)]
*  You've watched it for months, have you? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3797.64s)]
*  There we go. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3799.64s)]
*  You admitted that. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3801.64s)]
*  For the first part of the genocide, when it was clearly a [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3803.64s)]
*  genocide, you were treating pro-Israel guests. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3806.64s)]
*  I was treated with a very obvious response. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3809.3599999999997s)]
*  When was the most lethal month? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3811.3599999999997s)]
*  Hamas. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3813.3599999999997s)]
*  First month. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3815.3599999999997s)]
*  When they were wiping Gaza from the face of the earth, where Gaza [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3817.3599999999997s)]
*  within three months was a different colour and texture when [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3820.3599999999997s)]

*  was genocide and you were treating those people as though they had [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3831.3599999999997s)]
*  respectable views, but their views are more extreme than [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3834.3599999999997s)]

*  It's not what about Rwanda, it's about consistency. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3853.08s)]
*  What happened in Rwanda? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3856.08s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about every conflict around the world. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3858.08s)]
*  You've asked me a direct question about the first month in which [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3861.08s)]
*  Israel bombarded Hamas in Gaza. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3864.08s)]
*  They killed innocent civilians. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3866.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not murder if you were to do a proportionate response to a [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3869.7999999999997s)]
*  terrorist. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3872.7999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't proportionate. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3874.7999999999997s)]
*  I kept asking what is proportionate. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3876.7999999999997s)]
*  I have now concluded in the last few months it's gone way past [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3878.7999999999997s)]
*  proportionate. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3881.7999999999997s)]
*  You spent months... [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3883.7999999999997s)]
*  You don't blame Hamas for what happened in the first few weeks. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3885.7999999999997s)]
*  The war crimes, I blame them for their war crimes. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3888.7999999999997s)]
*  You don't blame them for what Israel then did. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3891.7999999999997s)]
*  They launched a massive tunnel network, they then launched the [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3894.52s)]
*  worst terror attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3897.52s)]
*  When Israel inevitably responds the way they did, that's not on [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3900.52s)]
*  Hamas. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3903.52s)]
*  There was no legal basis for what you just said. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3905.52s)]
*  You cannot say when you commit war crimes, I was made to do them. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3907.52s)]
*  Every war crime, legally speaking, that the Israeli military... [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3910.52s)]
*  I don't think what Israel did in the first few months was a war [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3913.52s)]
*  crime. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3916.52s)]
*  It was a defence against Hamas doing it again. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3918.52s)]
*  You wouldn't say that about the 240 Palestinians who had been [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3920.52s)]
*  killed by the Israeli military in the months before 7 October. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3924.24s)]
*  What is the difference? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3927.24s)]
*  Israelis have also been killed throughout the 75-year conflict. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3929.24s)]
*  You can go back over 75 years and you can say each could respond to [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3932.24s)]
*  the other. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3935.24s)]
*  They have always done it on a much smaller scale. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3937.24s)]
*  Do you accept that? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3939.24s)]
*  Do you accept what Hamas did on October 7 was on a scale totally [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3941.24s)]
*  out of guilt with anything that had happened on one day before? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3944.24s)]
*  Do you accept that? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3947.24s)]
*  Obviously they killed more Israelis on that day. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3949.24s)]
*  But what Israel has done since is infinitely worse. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3951.9599999999996s)]
*  By building the tunnel network, do you accept that Hamas protected [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3954.9599999999996s)]
*  themselves at the expense of the civilian population? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3957.9599999999996s)]
*  Israel wiped out civilians. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3960.9599999999996s)]
*  Do you accept that? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3962.9599999999996s)]
*  Israel attacked civilians. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3964.9599999999996s)]
*  Do you accept that Hamas knew what was going to happen? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3966.9599999999996s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3969.9599999999996s)]
*  Do you accept that part? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3971.9599999999996s)]
*  Again, it is relevant to the point of Israel attacking civilians. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3973.9599999999996s)]
*  It is relevant that Hamas knew exactly what was going to happen? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3976.9599999999996s)]
*  The first week was given a list of 100 targets by his general. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3980.68s)]
*  He said that is not all of the targets. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3983.68s)]
*  I want 400. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3985.68s)]
*  He said destroy their homes. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3987.68s)]
*  That is what he said. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3989.68s)]
*  This was revealed in an Israeli newspaper. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3991.68s)]
*  The idea that they were... [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3993.68s)]
*  The reason they slaughtered so many civilians in that first week was [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3995.68s)]
*  because of tunnels. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=3998.68s)]
*  It is a lie, you must know that. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4000.68s)]
*  It wasn't my question. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4002.68s)]
*  My question was do you not think that when Hamas planned this attack [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4004.68s)]
*  on Israel, having spent 20 years building this tunnel network, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4008.3999999999996s)]
*  they then hid in the tunnels and let their civilian population take [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4011.3999999999996s)]
*  the inevitable bombardment that was going to come back when they [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4014.3999999999996s)]
*  committed the attack they had committed? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4017.3999999999996s)]
*  In other words, Hamas sacrificed their own civilian population. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4019.3999999999996s)]
*  You are trying to deflect from Israel's direct... [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4022.3999999999996s)]
*  No, no. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4025.3999999999996s)]
*  You know Hamas committed war crimes. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4027.3999999999996s)]
*  Everybody accepts that. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4029.3999999999996s)]
*  Israel is guilty of the war crimes it perpetrated. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4031.3999999999996s)]
*  To be clear, your position is if a country is guilty of war crimes [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4034.3999999999996s)]
*  and if a country has a terror attack on the scale of what Hamas did [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4038.12s)]
*  to Israel on October 7, any response by that country militarily is [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4041.12s)]
*  a war crime. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4046.12s)]
*  Is that your position? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4048.12s)]
*  If you commit... [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4050.12s)]

*  legality or intention, Israel made clear... [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4055.12s)]
*  Israel made clear from the beginning... [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4058.12s)]
*  It is not a war crime. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4060.12s)]
*  Israel said from the beginning they were fighting human animals. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4062.12s)]

*  A war crime doesn't mean if you are attacked you can break [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4067.8399999999997s)]
*  international law and the norms of war. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4070.8399999999997s)]

*  It is not a war crime for a country to defend itself against [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4076.8399999999997s)]
*  terrorists. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4079.8399999999997s)]

*  It is a crime and that is not true. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4094.56s)]
*  That is not what I said. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4096.56s)]

*  Do you agree with the occupation? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4193.72s)]
*  No. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4196.72s)]
*  They announced the siege. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4198.72s)]
*  Is it a war crime or not? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4200.72s)]
*  Probably. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4202.72s)]
*  You accept they committed war crimes from day one? [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4204.72s)]
*  The siege they enacted because they were able to is indicative of [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4207.4400000000005s)]
*  the wider, bigger picture problem of the occupation. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4210.4400000000005s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4213.4400000000005s)]
*  You conceded the point that this doesn't begin in the 7 October. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4215.4400000000005s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4218.4400000000005s)]

*  He turned out to be a chump. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4244.16s)]
*  You look more of a chump when you don't accept Israel committing [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4246.16s)]
*  genocide. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4249.16s)]
*  It is easy to do. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4251.16s)]
*  When the ICC says it is genocide, I will say it is genocide. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4253.16s)]

*  We are running out of time. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4261.16s)]
*  Hamas committed war crimes. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4263.88s)]
*  You are not waiting for the ICC to make their case? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4265.88s)]
*  Hamas broadcast it on their own GoPros. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4268.88s)]
*  We are committing war crimes. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4271.88s)]

*  We agree with a lot more than people think. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4283.88s)]
*  You need to move over to accepting it is genocide. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4285.88s)]
*  That would be important. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4288.88s)]
*  There may be a time I do that. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFT2m79JqaM&t=4290.88s)]
