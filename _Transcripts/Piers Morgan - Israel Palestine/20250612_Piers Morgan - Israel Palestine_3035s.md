Video Description: Five of Israel’s allies, including the UK, have sanctioned Finance Minister Smotrich and Security Minister Ben-Gvir, accusing them of “inciting extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights” after both called for the aggressive expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Smotrich says that Gaza “will be entirely destroyed” and that “not one grain of wheat” should be allowed in.
The result is an extraordinary situation in which two of Israel’s top ministers are now banned from travelling to countries that Israel counts as friends and - President Trump might be the only person outside of Israel who can end this war. This week he called Netanyahu to tell him that a ceasefire and hostage deal are not enough and he expects the war to end.
Piers Morgan is joined by a satirist, former surgeon and a figurehead of the pro-Palestine movement, Bassem Youssef and former IDF spokesman and combat commander Jonathan Conricus to discuss the latest developments - with predictably impassioned results.

# “Do You Know How Many FAT Gazans I've Seen?” Bassem Youssef vs Jonathan Conricus
**Piers Morgan - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ)
*  Mr. Jonathan Connart is all of the Israeli cabinets have genocidal language. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We should start asking why are we finding this? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=6.44s)]
*  I think you should update your poison. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=10.44s)]
*  I've heard it a million times. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=12.48s)]
*  It's interesting for me to hear that from an Egyptian. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Egypt never received 30 billion dollars to murder children and bomb hospitals. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=17.8s)]
*  Israel is like Shaggy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=22.48s)]
*  You show you could get children. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=23.8s)]
*  It wasn't me. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=24.88s)]
*  You, your war crimes are documented. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=25.6s)]
*  They have broken more international laws than Didi has violated young rappers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=27.72s)]
*  I'll give you credit for saying catchy things and sound bites, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=35.36s)]
*  but in terms of actually knowing what's going on in Gaza, you have no clue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=38.64s)]
*  Three months of starvation, that is nonsense. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=42.68s)]
*  You know how many videos I've seen of fat Gazans, of fat Hamas fighters? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Dude, we gave you 30 billion dollars to bomb children and it's not enough for you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=50.8s)]
*  At least when you pay a dominatrix, you know that you're getting fucked. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=55.96s)]
*  Five of Israel's allies, including the United Kingdom, have sanctioned two [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=61.24s)]
*  senior members of the Israeli government. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=64.76s)]
*  Finance Minister Smodrich and Security Minister Ben-Gavir are accused of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=66.68s)]
*  inciting extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=70.32s)]
*  Both have called for the aggressive expansion of Israeli settlements [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=75.08s)]
*  and the West Bank. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=78.16s)]
*  Smodrich says that Gaza will be entirely destroyed and that not one grain of wheat [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=78.8s)]
*  should be allowed in. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=83.84s)]
*  That's genocidal language. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=84.84s)]
*  And the result is an extraordinary situation in which two of Israel's top [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=86.56s)]
*  ministers are now banned from traveling to countries that Israel counts as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=90.76s)]
*  friends and allies. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  The United States, Israel's oldest and most important ally, is rapidly running [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=96.44s)]
*  out of patience too. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=100.64s)]
*  President Trump might be the only person outside of Israel who can end this war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  This week he called Netanyahu to tell him that a ceasefire and a hostage deal [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  are not enough. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=109.68s)]
*  He expects the war to end. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  In today's debate, I'm joined by two very familiar contributors whose insights we [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  value and respect. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  Jonathan Conricas is a former IDF spokesman and combat commander. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  Bassem Youssef is a satirist, a former surgeon and a figurehead of the pro-Palestinian [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=121.0s)]
*  movement. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Both have spoken a lot about October the 7th and the long history of the war and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=126.64s)]
*  indeed the conflict. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=131.0s)]
*  So we're going to focus on what's happening now and what needs to happen next. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=132.32s)]
*  Jonathan will go first. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Bassem will respond. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=137.28s)]
*  We're trying to give both of you equal time and statement to respond to. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=138.64s)]
*  So let's get into this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  Jonathan Conricas, first of all, your reaction to this pretty unprecedented [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=143.72s)]
*  news that two Israeli senior ministers have effectively been sanctioned by some [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  of Israel's closest allies. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it puts into question if it really is a close ally. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=158.44s)]
*  And I think it's... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=162.88s)]
*  I'm very disappointed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=163.56s)]
*  I think it is egregious. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=165.12s)]
*  I think it's wrong. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=167.88s)]
*  I think that decision is hypocritical. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=169.0s)]
*  I think it is unfair and probably impossible standards that are only applied [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=172.24s)]
*  against Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think it is very unhelpful. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=178.28s)]
*  And I think that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the same words, very [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=181.16s)]
*  unhelpful for the UK and a few other countries to gang up against Israel and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  to do that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  I will say that I didn't vote for either of those two ministers and I probably [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=193.92s)]
*  don't share many of their views and definitely not their language and style [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  of communications. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=206.48s)]
*  But I will say that they were democratically elected and that in Israel, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=207.84s)]
*  which is more than I can say about a lot of people and so-called leaders in the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  region who are not under UK sanctions, and I think that they represent what [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=216.32s)]
*  their voters feel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=222.04s)]
*  Now, without espousing and supporting specifically what you quoted Betzalel [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  Smotich saying, when it comes to humanitarian aid, I think there's a bit [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=229.32s)]
*  of irony here that he is now sanctioned after he himself as Minister of Finance [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  signed the budget that pays for humanitarian aid that is now being [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=242.44s)]
*  delivered to Gazans. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  As far as I know, more than 14 million meals have been provided by Israel and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=250.32s)]
*  the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation over less than two weeks directly to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=255.92s)]
*  Palestinians without Hamas or their front organization, UNRWA, being able to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=261.16s)]
*  touch, contaminate, control and divert the aid. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=267.48s)]
*  And I think that is positive development. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=271.24s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=273.96s)]
*  I think that it is late in the game and we should have done it earlier, but I'm [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=275.0s)]
*  happy that it's being done now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=279.44s)]
*  I'm happy on two fronts because one, there is a need for food to be provided, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=281.32s)]
*  and two, it undermines the control and the stranglehold that Hamas has over the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=286.48s)]
*  Palestinian population. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=291.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=293.28s)]
*  And I would also say under the same, just one last thing appears under the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=293.56s)]
*  category of hypocrisy, I have read so many tweets and statements by so-called [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=298.28s)]
*  humanitarians who claim to care about food and the humanitarian situation in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=303.36s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=308.36s)]
*  They are the same people who are now saying that this humanitarian effort by [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=309.36s)]
*  Israel isn't enough and that they don't support it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=313.48s)]
*  I wonder why they don't support it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=316.56s)]
*  And I think that they don't support it because it doesn't support the UNRWA [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=318.96s)]
*  mechanism that is in place that keeps Hamas in place and because it is perhaps [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=323.56s)]
*  the beginning of the end for Hamas. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=328.88s)]
*  And a lot of people have a vested interest in Israel not defeating its [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  enemy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=335.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=336.56s)]
*  Bassem Youssef, your response. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  You guys are talking about these two ministers as if this is the exception. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=339.72s)]
*  I mean, like all of the Israeli cabinets have genocidal language. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  And Mr. Jonathan, con artist on the other side, he's like saying that they [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  represent their constituents, which means the whole society, the whole [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=354.6s)]
*  community is genocidal. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=358.68s)]
*  This is what they represent. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=360.76s)]
*  And actually, I think like we're asking the wrong question. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  We should be asking like instead of what we do, we should start asking, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=366.32s)]
*  why are we funding this? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  Why is my tax money, $30 billion to date, went to Israel to buy 2000 [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=371.12s)]
*  pounds bombs and F-35s to dump Palestinians? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  Why is your tax money, Pierce, is going to the British government to finance this? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=379.2s)]
*  If Israel wants to defend itself, let it defend itself by itself, not with my [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=384.84s)]
*  money. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=389.68s)]
*  And also, like this is like a country that's bragging that this lobby is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=390.4s)]
*  buying off politicians in America. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=395.12s)]
*  AIPAC is bragging about 80 percent of Congress being paid by them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=397.16s)]
*  If one politician in the EU, in Britain, in America was paid with bride by [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=401.44s)]

*  Last time I checked, Egypt is the second largest beneficiary of American money. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=676.44s)]

*  then have you asked yourself why the US is providing so much money to Egypt [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=686.52s)]
*  and what the US gets in return? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  And what I would like to know is why is the Arab Egyptian Republic [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=693.16s)]
*  refusing to receive refugees, their Arab Muslim brothers from Gaza? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=699.08s)]
*  And why are they so inhumane and cruel and preventing poor Gazans [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=704.52s)]
*  from escaping a war zone? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=709.64s)]

*  from leaving, escaping, fleeing a battlefield is this war. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=716.12s)]
*  I cannot remember, and maybe you as a comedian can think of another war [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=720.28s)]
*  where civilians were prevented from a neighboring non-hostile state to flee the war. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=725.48s)]
*  I cannot remember any such thing. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think that the country where you come from has a lot to answer from. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=733.16s)]
*  I know that you're more confident in bashing Israel and talking conspiracy theories [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=736.92s)]
*  and AIPAC this and that and all of the other nonsense that you regurgitated. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=743.16s)]
*  But let's talk about Egypt. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=747.8s)]
*  Let's talk about their responsibility. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=749.24s)]
*  Let's talk about US funds to Egypt. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=751.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about their cruelty. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=753.16s)]
*  Let's talk about how they have prevented humanitarian access to Gaza. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=754.92s)]
*  Let's talk about the fact that they have built the world's biggest wall [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=759.24s)]
*  that dwarfs the Chinese wall and all Israeli security walls between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=763.32s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=768.92s)]
*  Out of Muslim compassion? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=770.04s)]
*  Out of care for humanitarian rights of their Arab brothers? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=771.88s)]
*  No, because they want the poor Gazan skin and because they know that programs like this one [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=774.92s)]
*  and other programs will support Hamas propaganda and will blame Israel for what's happening. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=780.6800000000001s)]
*  When in fact, Gazan should have been evacuated out of Gaza in the second or third week of the war. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=786.6800000000001s)]
*  We would have defeated Hamas quickly and with far fewer unnecessary non-combatant casualties. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=793.88s)]
*  Just to be clear, programs like this one hosted by me, which is the point you're making, I think, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=800.84s)]
*  I'm afraid I take exception to a three-month policy of starvation of a populace that's been [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=805.48s)]
*  relentlessly bombarded that includes so many children. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=812.6s)]
*  That's my problem and I think that the war aims, the stated war aims of Israel at the start of this, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=815.64s)]
*  which was to eliminate Hamas and to get the hostages released, neither of those things have [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=821.56s)]
*  happened. All that's happening is more and more civilians are getting killed in the process of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=826.36s)]
*  going after the Hamas terrorists and you've taken also as a government to starving already [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=830.84s)]
*  impoverished children and I just find that unconscionable. As indeed, by the way, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=837.4s)]
*  two former Israeli prime ministers, we've got on record as saying that, and it was a very [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=842.04s)]
*  powerful piece by a Jewish writer, Thomas Friedman, in today's New York Times saying, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=846.04s)]
*  Israelis, the Espora Jewry and friends of Israel everywhere need to understand that the way Israel [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=850.68s)]
*  is fighting the war in Gaza today is laying the groundwork for a fundamental recasting of how [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=855.72s)]
*  Israel and Jews will be seen the world over and he doesn't mean in a good way, he means in a very bad [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=860.6s)]
*  and serious and potentially dangerous way. So yeah, this program has evolved, it does stand [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=866.6s)]
*  for that. Well, I'm going to get to Bassem for his response, but since you brought that up about [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=873.0s)]
*  this program and what it represents, that is what I... Okay, well, I'm going to let Bassem respond, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=878.28s)]
*  but that's my response to what you said. So, Bassem. Well, I didn't finish making a coherent [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=884.76s)]
*  sentence. Okay, by all means. I didn't interrupt you. You asked me about Egypt, I'll answer you. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=891.56s)]
*  You didn't. I appreciate that. Egypt takes one third of the aid that Israel receives while Egypt [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=899.4799999999999s)]
*  have 10 times the population. Egypt never received $30 billion to murder children and bomb hospitals. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=905.4799999999999s)]
*  Egypt was never allowed to have the privilege of having more than 58 vetoes in the Security Council, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=913.16s)]
*  and also, why doesn't Egypt take Palestinians? This is like someone going into Fifth Avenue, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=921.24s)]
*  shooting someone in the face, and it's like, why do my neighbors don't bury the body? You're the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=925.56s)]
*  guy doing the killing, not Egypt. So stop talking about Egypt. Anyways, and also I would like to, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  Jonathan and his likes, to please stop Zionizing us. Stop Zionizing. Zionizing, it's a verb, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=935.0s)]
*  which means to gaslight someone with such shameless narcissistic psychopathic audacity [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=941.16s)]
*  that you deny reality to their faces while simultaneously playing the victim, engaging [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=945.8s)]
*  in endless circle debates that go nowhere and displaying a complete loss of empathy and basic [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  humanity. Right? Remember, Piers, why the first video went viral? Because I called Israel a [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=956.52s)]
*  narcissistic psychopathic behavior that fucks you over and then makes you think it's your fault. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=962.28s)]
*  Because this is what Israel does. It didn't happen. And if it did, you're remembering it wrong. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=967.0799999999999s)]
*  And if you're not, it's your fault because you were looking into my phone. Narcissists lived in [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  their own made up reality. They don't share your reality. They live in their own custom made [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=975.0s)]
*  universe where facts are negotiable and truth is whatever serves them in the moment. And when it [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=980.28s)]
*  comes back and when you corner them, they back through tantrums, accusation, khamas, anti-Semitism, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=985.56s)]
*  full victimhood mood. And it's pointless to debate with them, right? Because take him, for example, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=992.04s)]
*  and the likes of him. You show them a video, it didn't happen. You show them UN reports, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=997.08s)]
*  these are lies. You mentioned international law, it's complicated. You get testimonies on the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1001.56s)]
*  ground from doctors and nurses at Hamas propaganda. Yeah, we saw it with our own eyes. Your optic nerve [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1006.92s)]
*  is anti-Semitic. Like Israel is like Shaggy. We saw you on the hot spot. It wasn't me. We show you [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1012.92s)]
*  connect children. It wasn't me. Dude, your war crimes are documented. Hamas propaganda. Also, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1018.1199999999999s)]
*  it wasn't me. There is no point of debating gas lighters. We have 4k videos, satellite imagery, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1023.0s)]
*  and your own soldiers posting on TikTok bragging about killing children. But of course, yeah, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1030.2s)]
*  the entire planet is having a mass hallucination, right? This is like Israel has that same [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1034.8400000000001s)]
*  credibility as a Ponzi scheme, right? This is why I'll give you an example. How do Lulu is Israel, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1040.28s)]
*  right? Israel calls itself, I mean, he was in the IDF and he tell you, the most moral army in the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1046.44s)]
*  world. Also, they call themselves the most vegan army in the world. So Jonathan here is representing [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1051.32s)]
*  an organization that is both vegan and genocidal. We will not eat chicken, but inshallah, we will [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1056.6s)]
*  bomb a hospital and barbecue it. See how fucked up is this? This is like calling Jeffrey Dahmer [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1061.8799999999999s)]
*  the most vegetarian serial killer in history, right? And one more thing. Does any army in the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1068.04s)]
*  world call itself moral? This is another trait of narcissistic psychopathic behavior because they [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1075.16s)]
*  project to the world the exact opposite of who they are. If they lie, they brag about being honest. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1080.12s)]
*  If they cheat, they brag about being faithful. And if they are cheap, they brag about being [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1085.24s)]
*  generous. And if they are criminal, genocidal, they brag about being moral, the most moral actually. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. I mean, look, I would take away from that something that you and I, Jonathan, have reached [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1095.8s)]
*  agreement about, which is it remains appalling to me that international media and journalists are not [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1100.36s)]
*  allowed into Gaza to examine the veracity of all these claims from an independent perspective, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1106.52s)]
*  because that would go a long way to answering the complaint, which is completely valid by Bassin, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1112.2s)]
*  that every time there is any kind of incident which reflects badly on Israel, the immediate [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1118.1200000000001s)]
*  response is to shed doubt over it ever happening or to say it's Hamas propaganda or whatever, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1123.72s)]
*  whatever, whatever. And the reason for that is because the Israeli government knows that there [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1128.8400000000001s)]
*  are no independent journalists from outside allowed in to ascertain the facts. And of course, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1134.6s)]
*  nearly 200 Palestinian journalists have been killed by airstrikes. So there is an awful... [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  So let's discuss that, Kios. Let's discuss it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1148.28s)]
*  I know that, Jonathan, you and I, I think, agree about that, right? I think it would be in Israel's [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1150.6799999999998s)]
*  interest and the world's interest if they simply lifted the ban on journalists and allowed independent [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1154.9199999999998s)]
*  journalists to do their job and verify all these things that are happening. I mean, you agree, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1161.48s)]
*  right? Tax Day has passed, but for millions of Americans, that's where the trouble begins. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1167.0s)]
*  The IRS is now ramping up enforcement for those who miss the April deadline or still owe back taxes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1172.2s)]
*  Well, today's sponsor, Tax Network USA, can still help. If your books are a mess, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1178.6s)]
*  if you're self-employed, or if you're a business owner, Tax Network USA specializes in cleaning up [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1184.1200000000001s)]
*  financial chaos and getting you back on track quickly. They say the IRS is applying enforcement [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1190.44s)]
*  pressure at levels they've never seen before. But even after the deadline, it's not too late [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1195.88s)]
*  to take control. Your consultation is completely free. Acting now could stop penalties, threatening [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1201.72s)]
*  letters, and surprise levies before they escalate. Call 1-800-958-1000 or visit tnusa.com slash [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1207.8s)]
*  peers. That's tnusa.com slash peers. Let Tax Network USA make the next move, not the IRS. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1218.28s)]
*  Yeah, I remember having this conversation with you and I think it was that little Canadian Jew, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1229.48s)]
*  self-hating Jew, I forgot his name, who repeated the same lies or the same story about media. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1236.12s)]
*  And I remember telling you, Piers, that I will personally see you in the Gaza Strip if you decide [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1243.6399999999999s)]
*  to come over since you have been campaigning on this. And since I think that you have a point, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1250.6s)]
*  I don't think that what you say is true. And I don't think that all of the allegations that you [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1256.12s)]
*  make, some of them are directly unfounded. But many of the things that you say... [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1260.36s)]
*  Which allegations are unfounded? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1264.9199999999998s)]
*  What you said in the beginning of three months, the last... [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1267.24s)]
*  The three month blockade, yeah, food and aid. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1271.8s)]
*  ...time to respond. Yeah, three months of starvation, that is nonsense. That is absolute [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1273.6399999999999s)]
*  nonsense. But you had a three month blockade, right? I mean, there was a... [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1278.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, Jonathan, Jonathan, hang on. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1282.84s)]
*  So let me explain. You asked, you did your monologue... [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1285.3999999999999s)]
*  You're saying nonsense, but there was a three... [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1288.2s)]
*  You have the mic. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1289.72s)]
*  Don't just keep talking. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1290.2s)]
*  And if you'll allow me to explain, I will. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1291.6399999999999s)]
*  There was a three month blockade of food and aid, you accept that? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1293.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Piers, listen, we both know that I cannot be in a shouting contest with your mic [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1295.88s)]
*  with this situation, so I'm not even going to try. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1301.64s)]
*  Of course you can. You can't just dispute... [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1303.72s)]
*  No, of course. No, I'm not. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1305.3200000000002s)]
*  But I... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1306.44s)]
*  You have to agree there was a three month blockade. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1307.3200000000002s)]
*  I will tell you what there was. There was, before that, a ceasefire, which was violated by Hamas, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1311.5600000000002s)]
*  when Hamas refused to turn over hostages and to agree to the deal that was presented by the US [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1319.72s)]
*  with Egyptian and even Qatari support, Hamas refused to hand over those hostages and to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1326.8400000000001s)]
*  continue the ceasefire. The ceasefire was ended and Israel returned to fighting. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1333.4s)]
*  Now, during the ceasefire, Israel literally pumped the Gaza Strip with international aid, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1338.2s)]
*  not because we very much wanted to do so, because those were the conditions of the aid... [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1345.88s)]
*  What happened when the ceasefire ended? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1350.1200000000001s)]
*  ...and that was with the American administration... [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1351.5600000000002s)]
*  What happened when the ceasefire ended? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1352.68s)]
*  And when the ceasefire... [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1353.88s)]
*  And when the ceasefire ended, Israel stopped allowing that because fighting continued. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1355.8000000000002s)]
*  And Israel killed 300 people... [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1359.96s)]
*  And here's the really important part. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1361.16s)]
*  The next day, Israel killed 300 people... [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1363.0800000000002s)]
*  But here is the really important part, Piers. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1365.88s)]
*  I don't expect even you to try and explain, they were all terrorists, right? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1366.7600000000002s)]
*  So they killed 300 people the next day and you launched... [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1370.6000000000001s)]
*  I'll get to that. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1373.24s)]
*  And the Israeli government launched a three-month blockade of food and aid. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1373.32s)]
*  These are simple facts. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1377.32s)]
*  And Israel did indeed stop providing aid to its enemy and to the population there. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1379.08s)]
*  But it was not a tactic of starvation. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1387.3999999999999s)]
*  Nobody is starving in Gaza. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1391.1599999999999s)]
*  Nobody is starving in Gaza. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1394.52s)]
*  So why are they risking death, stampeding each other to get to food? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1396.04s)]
*  With international aid, Piers, after the Gaza Strip was flooded with aid, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1400.68s)]
*  and when UN warehouses couldn't even meet the capacity, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1405.5600000000002s)]
*  and when truckloads were delivered from the Israeli side and weren't even [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1409.88s)]
*  taken by the UN on the other side and by their Hamas counterparts, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1414.52s)]
*  that is when Israel said, okay, we're also going to go back to fighting. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1418.76s)]
*  And nobody is starving in Gaza. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1422.68s)]
*  That is a complete fabrication. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1424.52s)]
*  And if you speak about 4K evidence and all of that, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1427.0s)]
*  Bassem mentioned a lot of nonsense, but you speak about evidence. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1429.88s)]
*  You know how many videos I've seen of fat Gazans, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1433.0800000000002s)]
*  of fat Hamas fighters, of overweight Gazans? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you know how difficult it is for an Israeli to believe that Gazans are starving? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1440.6000000000001s)]
*  When I see in social media that there are open hotels, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1444.8400000000001s)]
*  that the markets have fresh produce, and that I know the amount of food [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1449.24s)]
*  that is coming into the Gaza Strip. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1453.5600000000002s)]
*  So allow me to question and doubt everything what you say, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1455.56s)]
*  Yehabibi, allow me to question and doubt everything that you say, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1461.48s)]
*  Mr. Comedian Bassem, and because you don't have standing, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1465.6399999999999s)]

*  You do that very well, but in terms of actually knowing what's going on in Gaza, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1476.2s)]
*  you have no clue. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1480.9199999999998s)]
*  You're a complete uneducated person who is just regurgitating monologues [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1482.28s)]
*  and catchy names and popular culture. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1488.28s)]
*  And you don't think that branding Gazans a bunch of fat people who aren't starving, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1490.8400000000001s)]
*  you think that's not a catchy little phrase. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1495.24s)]
*  That is the funniest shit I've ever heard. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1497.4s)]
*  I mean, come on, really, Jonathan, you're reduced to saying that [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1499.4s)]
*  all Gazans are so overfed, they're all fat. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1502.8400000000001s)]

*  Send them treadmills and pelotons. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1506.92s)]
*  The only really skinny people that I've seen in Gaza, you know who they were? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1509.08s)]
*  They were Israeli hostages that were starved by Hamas. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1513.24s)]
*  They are the only skinny people, malnourished and tortured people [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1516.12s)]
*  that I've seen coming out of Gaza. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1520.84s)]
*  They are the only ones that have been really malnourished. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1523.08s)]
*  All the other ones that I've seen, and believe me, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1525.3999999999999s)]
*  I have watched hours and hours of footage of Gaza [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1528.04s)]
*  that none of you have taken the time to watch. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1531.24s)]
*  And I've seen a lot of healthy and some of them, yes, overweight. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1533.8s)]
*  To verify whether there are actually any starving people in Gaza. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1537.96s)]
*  If you're so right, and all the Gazans are incredibly fat [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1542.68s)]
*  from all the extra food they've been eating, you did actually. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1546.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1549.96s)]
*  Now I didn't say that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1550.8400000000001s)]
*  I said that I've seen fat Gazans. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1552.92s)]
*  We can analyze just how many fat people in Gaza there are [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1554.8400000000001s)]

*  You won't let journalists get in to verify it. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1571.4s)]
*  I'll say it now a fourth time, Piers. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1574.1200000000001s)]

*  I am inviting you personally a fourth time. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1578.92s)]
*  And I've said it, I think three or four months ago, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1582.1200000000001s)]
*  when I was last before that on your show, I said, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1584.5200000000002s)]
*  Piers, I agree that you should be able to get access to it [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1587.16s)]
*  because you have been campaigning. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1590.68s)]
*  And you would let me go anywhere in Gaza? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1592.2s)]
*  Or would I have to be directed to where you want me to stay? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1595.0s)]
*  I would accompany you and make sure that you would get access. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1597.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1599.24s)]
*  No, I would make sure that you get in [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1599.72s)]
*  and that you get the opportunity to speak with Palestinians. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1602.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1605.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1605.4s)]
*  And I think that you would have a good opportunity to do it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1605.96s)]
*  I was promised equal to me. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1609.48s)]
*  Bassim, your response. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1610.52s)]
*  I've spoken for three minutes, even less, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1611.8s)]
*  and the rest he's spoken. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1614.52s)]
*  This is unfair. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1615.88s)]
*  Like, come on, guys. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1617.08s)]
*  You had equal time until that last exchange [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1617.72s)]

*  So now you can respond, Bassim. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1621.72s)]
*  So first of all, Israel is known, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1624.52s)]
*  they have broken more international laws [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1626.28s)]
*  than Didi has violated young rappers. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1629.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1633.08s)]

*  Right? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1634.92s)]
*  This is the problem with debating with pathological liars than him. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1635.16s)]
*  It's like trying to nail jelly to the wall. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1639.56s)]

*  Right? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1655.8000000000002s)]
*  You present evidence, they question the source. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1656.2s)]

*  Right? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1669.4s)]
*  Everything can be always debated, including gravity. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1669.8000000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1672.5200000000002s)]
*  Reality for them is another opinion. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1672.92s)]
*  War crimes becomes allegation, genocide becomes a conflict, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1674.8400000000001s)]

*  And you're killing people. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1753.0s)]

*  Try to keep it civilized. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1759.32s)]
*  Do it for a second. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1760.76s)]
*  Try to keep it civilized. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1761.8s)]
*  Civilized. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1763.16s)]
*  OK, Habibi. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1763.8s)]
*  Anyway, like, let's talk about journalists. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1764.6s)]
*  Like, let's talk about journalists. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1767.56s)]
*  How many times they killed journalists, right? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1769.08s)]
*  And how many times they denied it? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1771.56s)]
*  They said, like, it's Hamas. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1773.08s)]
*  Like, it's not us. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1774.04s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1774.84s)]
*  We will investigate. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1775.64s)]
*  And let's talk about journalists, Baal. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1776.84s)]
*  Let's talk about Aza Weinstein. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1778.6s)]
*  A British journalist in London. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1780.6s)]
*  His house was raided by British police for writing and exposing Israeli war crimes, for [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1782.84s)]
*  exposing their claims on October 7, for exposing the rape hoax. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1791.64s)]
*  He debunked the rape hoax. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1795.8s)]
*  He exposed the Hannibal Directive. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1797.0s)]
*  This is a guy sitting in London talking about a foreign country, and he was raided by British [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1798.68s)]
*  police. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1804.3600000000001s)]
*  So I want to ask everybody who cares about freedom of expression, including you, Pierce. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1805.3200000000002s)]
*  Like, shouldn't you be worried that one of your nationals, a British journalist, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1810.3600000000001s)]
*  he shares your same profession to be raided by London police and his equipment is taken [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1817.16s)]
*  away for writing about a foreign country? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1824.52s)]
*  What does this tell you about England? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1826.6000000000001s)]
*  What does this tell you about Israel? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1828.6000000000001s)]
*  What does this tell you about their so-called freedom of expression in the West? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1830.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1835.16s)]
*  So this is the problem. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1835.64s)]
*  Like, this is the problem of dealing with people like- [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  So let me ask you a question, Bassim. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1839.88s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1841.96s)]
*  Because I've given Jonathan a hard time. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1842.92s)]
*  I think he deserved it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1845.0800000000002s)]
*  Some of the things you said. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1846.52s)]
*  And let me give you a different type of question. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1847.8s)]
*  The Israelis say, and have said from the start, all that has to happen is Hamas release the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1851.56s)]
*  remaining hostages. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1858.28s)]
*  And they have steadfastly refused to release the people that they kidnapped on October [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1859.64s)]
*  7, 2023. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1864.6000000000001s)]
*  Why don't they release the hostages? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1866.52s)]
*  And do you condemn them for not releasing them? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1868.28s)]
*  You see, this is the problem. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1871.88s)]
*  Is that going hard on him, Pierce? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1872.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1874.36s)]
*  Do you condemn Hamas? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1874.6s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1876.04s)]
*  Your voice is annoying. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  Stop. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1879.08s)]
*  Your voice- [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1880.36s)]
*  So is yours, but that's okay. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1880.84s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1883.7199999999998s)]
*  But I manage. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1884.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1884.84s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1885.8s)]
*  People pay to come to my shows. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1886.28s)]
*  They won't pay to come to yours. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1887.7199999999998s)]
*  Anyways, so here's the- [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1889.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1891.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to go into a pissing contest with who is a better comedian. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1893.1599999999999s)]
*  And because you lose. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1897.32s)]
*  You can have that title. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1897.9599999999998s)]
*  You can be a satirical. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1899.08s)]
*  You will definitely lose. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1900.4399999999998s)]
*  You can continue to be a comedian. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1901.56s)]
*  Okay, so here's the thing. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1904.76s)]
*  Let's talk about credibility. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1905.56s)]
*  This is what Israel claims. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1907.24s)]
*  Why would I believe anything that Israel says? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1909.08s)]
*  Pierce, did you ask him a question or is this another monologue? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  I do want an answer to the question, Bassim. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1914.52s)]
*  I think it's only fair. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1916.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1917.72s)]
*  I mean, it's a very straightforward question. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1917.96s)]
*  Yes, I'm telling you. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1919.08s)]
*  This is Israel claims. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1919.8799999999999s)]
*  Why do I believe a liar? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1921.1599999999999s)]
*  Israel has lost- [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1922.76s)]
*  Well, you don't dispute there are still hostages, do you? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1924.6799999999998s)]
*  Or do you? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1927.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1928.44s)]
*  These negotiations have fallen many times within the government [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1929.0s)]
*  because people inside the Netanyahu government didn't went through- [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1933.16s)]
*  Yeah, but that wasn't the question I asked you. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1936.28s)]
*  You have testimonies from hostages. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1937.72s)]
*  But hang on, Bassim. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1939.24s)]
*  That wasn't the question I asked you. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1939.88s)]
*  I simply said, why haven't they released the hostages? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1941.32s)]
*  And do you- [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1944.76s)]
*  Well, you can ask Hamas for this because I'm not the Hamas- [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1945.24s)]
*  Let me remind you a bit. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1947.32s)]
*  And do you condemn Hamas for not releasing them? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1948.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1951.32s)]
*  You can def Hamas. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1954.28s)]
*  You could- [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1955.48s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1956.12s)]
*  I can def Hamas. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1956.76s)]
*  This is great. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1957.56s)]
*  Even if they have hostages, even if Hamas was a vampire sucking [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1959.0s)]
*  baby's blood, what is happening there is not justifiable. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1963.88s)]
*  You're not just- [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1967.8s)]
*  You cannot even destroy a whole population. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1968.44s)]
*  That's a different question. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1971.0s)]
*  Because they're- [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1971.88s)]
*  It's a different question. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1972.2s)]
*  Homemade- [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1973.0800000000002s)]
*  Like- [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1973.88s)]
*  But Bassim, that's a different question. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1974.44s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1976.1200000000001s)]
*  Even if they have hostages- [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1977.0s)]
*  By the way, Bassim, I actually agree with you. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1977.88s)]
*  But my question is very simple. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1981.56s)]
*  Should Hamas release the hostages or does the fact they keep refusing to, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1983.96s)]
*  do you condemn that? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1987.64s)]
*  A simple question. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1988.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1989.48s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1989.8000000000002s)]
*  Hamas have agreed to- [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1990.6000000000001s)]
*  Again, I'm not a Hamas representative. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1991.72s)]
*  I cannot speak for them. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1993.96s)]
*  But we all know that Hamas has agreed- [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1995.0800000000002s)]
*  Afford me, Bassim. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1997.0s)]
*  And Israel comes- [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1997.8000000000002s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1998.76s)]
*  Israel has sabotaged this deal many times based on [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=1999.24s)]
*  testimonies from inside the Israeli government [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2003.0800000000002s)]
*  and from the families of the hostages. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2005.4s)]
*  Israel is the one that's been sabotaging this many- [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2006.92s)]
*  But answer my questions. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2008.68s)]
*  I am answering your questions. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2010.76s)]
*  You're not? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2012.44s)]
*  It's not that we do it because they do it because Israel has sabotaged- [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2012.92s)]
*  Should they release the hostages? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2015.3200000000002s)]
*  And do you condemn them for not releasing them? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2017.0s)]
*  Of course they should. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2018.92s)]
*  Of course they should. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2020.12s)]
*  And do you condemn them for taking the hostages and not releasing them? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2020.84s)]
*  I condemn Hamas for not releasing the country. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2024.76s)]
*  And I condemn Israel for keeping more than 25,000 hostages in Israel. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2027.0s)]
*  Half of them is women and children. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2033.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2035.4s)]
*  And again, let me go back to my point. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2035.88s)]
*  Readability. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2038.2s)]
*  Israel has lied many times. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2039.32s)]
*  You have the prime minister of Israel, Nibirah Menedineh, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2040.68s)]
*  went in front of the UN right before they bombed Lebanon. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2043.0s)]
*  And he said every house in south Lebanon, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2046.36s)]
*  in their kitchen, in their garage harbors a missile for Hezbollah. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2049.3199999999997s)]
*  If this is not comedy, what is this? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2053.7999999999997s)]
*  How can you believe someone who said something that- [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2057.3199999999997s)]
*  Have you been to southern Lebanon? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2059.08s)]
*  And he said- [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2060.68s)]
*  Have you been there? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2061.3199999999997s)]
*  Do you know anything about it? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2062.12s)]
*  No. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2064.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course not. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2064.52s)]
*  Don't say that. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2065.0s)]
*  Have you been there? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2065.56s)]
*  Do you know anything about it? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2066.3599999999997s)]
*  Out of the three of us, I'm actually the only guy who's been there. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2068.2799999999997s)]
*  You haven't been there. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2072.2799999999997s)]
*  You don't know about it. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2073.48s)]
*  I'm quite sure that you haven't seen intelligence about Hezbollah operations. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2075.08s)]
*  And I'm quite sure that Piers hasn't either. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2079.4s)]
*  I can tell you that I've seen it with my own eyes. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2081.56s)]
*  Yes, I have seen tunnels underneath houses in Lebanon. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2084.44s)]
*  I have seen houses that Hezbollah use for military purposes. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2089.08s)]
*  And when you speak about lying, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2093.88s)]
*  at least you should have something to back up your claims. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2095.72s)]
*  You're saying nonsense. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2098.92s)]
*  You don't know what you're talking about. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2100.2s)]
*  You're cheap TV talk. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2102.04s)]
*  Don't talk over each other, Jonathan. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2104.04s)]
*  There's no point. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2105.64s)]
*  Let Bassim finish and then respond. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2106.52s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2108.44s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2108.7599999999998s)]
*  All right, finish your point, Bassim, and let Jonathan respond. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2109.96s)]
*  That's a lot of- [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2112.92s)]
*  It's fragile. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2113.64s)]
*  Always deeply hurt state. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2114.68s)]
*  While doing that, they're doing that while holding the gun. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2116.44s)]
*  Israel is what happens when you give a very advanced military to a caravan. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2118.68s)]
*  Actually, he looks like a caravan. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2122.7599999999998s)]
*  He looks like a male Scandinavian version of a caravan. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2123.96s)]
*  Actually, he looks like he swallowed a caravan. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2126.44s)]
*  But Israel is the only place where you can bulldoze a house [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2128.04s)]
*  and then sue you for strutting the tent. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2130.7599999999998s)]
*  But, dude, dude, nobody, everybody knows that you're lying. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2132.84s)]
*  Your neighbor knows that you're lying. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2136.6800000000003s)]
*  Your barista knows you're lying. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2137.88s)]
*  Even your GPS avoids your house because of this thing [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2139.56s)]
*  that comes from your vicinity. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2142.04s)]
*  Everybody knows you're lying. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2143.32s)]
*  Well, I would say this. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2144.28s)]
*  All right, let me jump in. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2145.08s)]
*  You are pathologically lying. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2146.6s)]
*  OK, let me put it this way. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2147.88s)]
*  You know what, Jonathan? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2149.8s)]
*  You're perfectly entitled to not care what I think about any of this [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2151.2400000000002s)]
*  or what Bassim Youssef has to say about it. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2153.88s)]
*  Because obviously, he has passionate views on the other side of this. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2156.84s)]
*  And I've changed my views, as you know. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2160.6s)]
*  I've said this to you very clearly. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2162.12s)]
*  But I'm not the only one. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2164.52s)]
*  What would concern me right now if I was Israeli or Jewish, actually, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2165.96s)]
*  is if I read Thomas Friedman's column, which was very powerful, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2170.8399999999997s)]
*  and I urge people to read it today on the New York Times website, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2174.52s)]
*  if I saw that the UK, Australia, Norway, Canada, New Zealand [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2179.08s)]
*  have sanctioned two members of the Israeli government [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2184.3599999999997s)]
*  for repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2187.08s)]
*  if two former prime ministers, one Ehud Elmer, said, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2190.6s)]
*  enough is enough, Israel's committing war crimes, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2194.44s)]
*  Ehud Barak choosing a war of deception [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2197.16s)]
*  would write a new chapter in the March of Folly. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2199.72s)]
*  The war is a misleading smokescreen that purports to be a campaign [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2201.96s)]
*  for the country's security in future, while in actuality, it's a political war. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2205.56s)]
*  You've got your own former prime ministers. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2209.88s)]
*  You've got Jewish columnists. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2211.7999999999997s)]
*  You've got five allies. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2214.2s)]
*  And they're all being increasingly critical of what this Israeli government is doing. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2217.16s)]
*  Why does that not concern you? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2222.84s)]
*  So let's address that. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2226.36s)]
*  First, let's characterize the countries that are part of that. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2229.08s)]
*  Norway is not an ally. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2233.48s)]
*  Norway has been really the tip of the most extreme part in Europe, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2235.56s)]
*  propagating for Palestinian state at all costs. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2241.72s)]
*  I will, I will. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2245.96s)]
*  And as I said in the beginning, I am indeed worried. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2247.4s)]
*  I'm saddened by it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2251.4s)]
*  I think that it is a wrong decision. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2252.44s)]
*  And I regret that that is what the UK has decided to be the policy that the UK is fighting. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2254.92s)]
*  You know why they're doing it, don't you, John? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2261.48s)]
*  They're doing it because Smodrich and Ben-Gavir have made no secret [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2263.48s)]
*  through their publicly stated comments [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2268.68s)]
*  that they want to kick all the Palestinians out of Gaza. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2271.4s)]
*  They're also endorsing endless new illegal settlements on the West Bank. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2274.8399999999997s)]
*  This is genocidal language that they're talking. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2279.3199999999997s)]
*  That's why these actions have been taken. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2281.96s)]
*  And I don't believe, Jonathan, having interviewed you many times, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2283.88s)]
*  just at the start of the war, I do not believe that you [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2290.7599999999998s)]
*  have anything in common with these people. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2295.48s)]
*  I just think you instinctively know what they're saying [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2298.12s)]
*  and what they are planning to do is wrong. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2301.48s)]
*  So let me say this. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2305.08s)]
*  As I said in the beginning, and I've been clear about it, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2306.92s)]
*  I didn't vote for and I probably don't support them in much of what they say, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2310.92s)]
*  not in content and not in the way that they say it. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2317.0s)]
*  I don't think that everything that these two ministers, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2321.24s)]
*  these elected officials say is wrong. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2325.3199999999997s)]
*  But I do think that many of their statements have been tasteless, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2328.8399999999997s)]
*  have been wrong and have been unhelpful. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2332.52s)]
*  Now, what I am concerned with a lot, really a lot, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2336.36s)]
*  is what we spoke about the last conversation when you had Ehud Olmert on. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2341.24s)]
*  You asked him one semi-serious question about the war crimes allegations. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2346.2s)]
*  He didn't back it up because he doesn't have anything to back it up with. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2353.16s)]
*  He was just there for the headlines and for the attention. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2356.92s)]
*  Because he has a grudge against Bibi and because he also has a lot of criticism against him. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2362.68s)]
*  That is fine and that's part of the Israeli political debate and environment. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2367.56s)]
*  That is usually what happens in democracies when people have the ability to [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2372.68s)]
*  say what they think and they have the freedom to do so. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2377.08s)]
*  By the way, Arabs have it as well in Israel, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2379.32s)]
*  unlike in most other countries in the Middle East. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2382.6s)]
*  However, what I would say is also very worrying and I think relevant to this program [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2385.08s)]
*  and to many other programs is how easily Hamas propaganda and anti-Semitism are platformed [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2390.92s)]
*  and what the consequences of journalists. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2398.2000000000003s)]
*  A few questions ago, you started speaking about journalists. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2400.6800000000003s)]
*  I would like to address the issue of the responsibility of journalists [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2404.44s)]
*  when they report from the field. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2408.6800000000003s)]
*  I would like to address the responsibility of the New York Times. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2410.52s)]
*  They are in the field. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2415.4s)]
*  They are in the field. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2417.48s)]
*  They have people in the field and they have people in Jerusalem. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2418.6s)]
*  How many international journalists are currently operating freely in Gaza? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2424.44s)]
*  Why would you diminish the importance of Palestinian journalists? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2430.7599999999998s)]
*  I asked you how many international journalists? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2434.12s)]
*  Why would you unqualify them? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2436.2s)]
*  Kill them! [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2437.24s)]
*  You killed them! [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2437.96s)]
*  I said how many international journalists are in Gaza? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2438.92s)]
*  You can see who is reporting. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2442.2s)]
*  None. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2443.72s)]
*  Yes, but you can see who is reporting. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2445.08s)]
*  All of the major networks are reporting from Gaza. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2448.36s)]
*  If you don't like the reporting from Gaza, then let international journalists in. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2451.08s)]
*  But you won't and there's only one reason you won't. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2455.56s)]
*  Because you don't want journalists to actually report what's happening. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2458.1200000000003s)]
*  You would rather smear all Palestinian journalists as Hamas. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2463.7200000000003s)]
*  We are in agreement. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2467.0s)]
*  We have covered it and I have already said that we are in agreement that you [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2469.8s)]
*  and I have said to Israeli counterparts off media that I think we should allow journalists in. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2473.8s)]
*  We have said that and I think you don't need to use it every time. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2480.44s)]
*  But it hasn't happened yet. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2483.6400000000003s)]
*  I start to make an argument of something that is remotely inconvenient. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2484.52s)]
*  You keep questioning the integrity of Palestinian journalists who are getting killed in large numbers. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2487.32s)]
*  Record numbers in fact. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2493.6400000000003s)]
*  But you won't let the international journalists in. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  I will continue to do that, Piers. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2496.84s)]
*  Yes, and I will continue to question the veracity of the report. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2499.0800000000004s)]
*  But that's very easy to do, isn't it? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2503.16s)]
*  So easy to smear Palestinian journalists who are dying in large numbers. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2505.08s)]
*  Because you won't let any other journalists in. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2508.68s)]
*  So you say all the ones that are there are pro-Hamas. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2510.6s)]
*  Piers, there is a lot of reporting from Gaza. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2512.68s)]
*  There is a lot of reporting from Gaza and really I think it's fine that you have a point to make. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2515.8799999999997s)]
*  But you cannot say that every time I open my mouth and I speak about press coverage [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2522.2799999999997s)]
*  or falsifying reality or repeating Hamas propaganda. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2526.92s)]
*  That cannot be the answer that you use each and every time that I make a point about reporting. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2531.64s)]
*  Actually it can. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2535.96s)]
*  And responsibility of journalists and editors. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2536.6s)]
*  No, it cannot be. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2539.48s)]
*  I can, Jonathan. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2540.8399999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you why I can. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2541.7999999999997s)]
*  No, it cannot be. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2542.52s)]
*  Let me answer. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2543.24s)]
*  No. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2544.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll tell you why I can. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2544.44s)]
*  You can do everything. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2545.24s)]
*  I'll tell you why I can. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2546.04s)]
*  Because actually... [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2547.0s)]
*  I think responsibility... [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2548.12s)]
*  Let me answer you. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2549.64s)]
*  ...goes both ways. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2550.2799999999997s)]
*  Let me answer you. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2551.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2551.8799999999997s)]
*  Let me answer you. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2552.3599999999997s)]
*  Responsibility as a journalist also goes both ways. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2552.8399999999997s)]
*  Stop talking and let me answer you. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2554.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2556.44s)]
*  This is the reason I can. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2556.68s)]
*  By all means, Piers. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2557.8799999999997s)]
*  Because ultimately we've got to a place in this war where Israel denies or casts doubt over anything that happens [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2558.68s)]
*  which reflects negatively on the IDF or the Israeli government. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2567.24s)]
*  Anything. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2570.7599999999998s)]
*  It's all just dismissed as it didn't happen, it didn't happen like that. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2571.3199999999997s)]
*  That's also not true. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2575.64s)]
*  We'll launch an internal investigation ourselves. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2576.04s)]
*  If we're honest, that's not true. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2578.12s)]
*  And so the overriding answer to all of that problem, to all of that, to get to the truth, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2579.24s)]
*  to get to the bottom of it, is let the international journalists in. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2584.7599999999998s)]
*  So I will keep saying it until it happens. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2588.04s)]
*  I know you agree with me. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2590.44s)]
*  Okay, you can keep saying it, Piers. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2591.56s)]
*  But you agreeing with me doesn't make it change. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2593.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2596.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2597.32s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2597.8s)]
*  As I said, you can keep on saying it, but I would keep on saying that I think journalists and editors [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2599.08s)]
*  have responsibility for the lies that they spread and for the anti-Semitism that they help flame. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2604.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think that we see that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2612.12s)]
*  Jews, when you speak, you expressed concern and you asked me how I feel as an Israeli and as a Jew [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2613.72s)]
*  about what people say and about the situation. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2619.96s)]
*  I am concerned without even a drop of cynicism about what you said. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2622.8399999999997s)]
*  And I think those are serious issues that this government needs to answer for. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2626.68s)]
*  But I will also say that I am very concerned with the ease and with the negligence that I see [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2631.16s)]
*  journalists and people with access to microphones, how they just spread falsehoods, liables, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2638.2s)]
*  and lies about Israel and about Jews. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2645.56s)]
*  And I see the real world consequences of what happens when Islamists and Palestinian supporters [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2648.52s)]
*  and Hamas supporters and all of the other bad apples that have embedded themselves in Western society [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2654.84s)]
*  are allowed to take the streets in London. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2660.92s)]
*  But we've also got Jonathan, I'm going to get a bass in. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2663.48s)]
*  Look, I'm going to get a bass in to respond. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2664.44s)]
*  But I would just say on that point, I myself have seen in the last two weeks that if you dare to [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2667.16s)]
*  criticise the Israeli government in a way that almost everybody is now doing, by the way, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2672.68s)]
*  whether it's former Israeli prime ministers, whether it's allies of the country, you name it, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2678.92s)]
*  people are queuing up to criticise the Israeli government. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2683.64s)]
*  But when I did it, despite having defended Israel's right to defend itself for many, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2686.04s)]
*  many months, as Bassem knows, we argued about it, that I was immediately accused of being [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2691.88s)]
*  a Jew hater and an anti-Semite. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2697.32s)]
*  It is a deliberate campaign. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2699.6400000000003s)]
*  Pierce, that's not accurate. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2701.56s)]
*  It was a deliberate campaign to shut me up. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2702.12s)]
*  It was a deliberate campaign to stop me criticising the Israeli government by branding me a Jew [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2705.48s)]
*  hating anti-Semite, which anyone who's watched this show from the start of this war knows is [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2711.4s)]
*  complete nonsense. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2716.52s)]
*  Right, Bassem, your final words to this. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2717.56s)]
*  That's not truthful. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2720.68s)]
*  Well, it is true. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2721.72s)]
*  I read it every second on social media. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2722.44s)]
*  I saw myself being accused of being a Jew hating anti-Semite. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2726.3599999999997s)]
*  Pierce, you know that the criticism against you wasn't because you have criticism against [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2729.96s)]
*  Israel. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2736.68s)]
*  It was because how you spoke to Natasha, the tone and the demeanor. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2737.16s)]
*  It wasn't the content of what you said. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2741.72s)]
*  Which I make no apology for, by the way. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2742.7599999999998s)]
*  It was how you spoke. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2744.52s)]
*  She is a barrister for a group called Lawyers for Israel. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2744.9199999999996s)]
*  She's not an impartial horse in the race. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2748.36s)]
*  She's supposed to be an international barrister. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2750.6000000000004s)]
*  If she can't take tough questions or being challenged or being interrupted by a journalist, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2753.0s)]
*  she's in the wrong job. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2758.28s)]
*  Right, Bassem, your response to Jonathan. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2759.8s)]
*  Respectfully disagree. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2761.88s)]
*  Bassem will now be allowed to speak without interruption to finish the debate. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2764.28s)]
*  Bassem. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2768.1200000000003s)]
*  First of all, Pierce, welcome to the behaviour of narcissistic psychopaths. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2769.2400000000002s)]
*  They love bombing you and then when you make a single criticism about them, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2773.8s)]
*  they go all flip like bat shit on you. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2777.72s)]
*  Welcome, Habibi. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2780.2799999999997s)]
*  Jonathan overuses the word anti-Semitism so much. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2782.2s)]
*  It's like a used condom at this point. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2785.24s)]
*  Completely stretch out, lost all its protection and nobody wants to touch it anymore. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2787.16s)]
*  Jonathan uses Hamas more like a crackhead uses excuses. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2791.08s)]
*  Let me tell you about things from the ground. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2795.72s)]
*  I'm coming to London, by the way. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2797.8799999999997s)]
*  19th of July, there is a big concert called Voices for Solidarity. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2799.24s)]
*  They are organised by health workers for Palestine. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2803.8799999999997s)]
*  These are people that were on the ground and they saw with their own eyes and they have [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2807.3199999999997s)]
*  testimony. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2810.52s)]
*  I would love you to actually host some of them. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2810.9199999999996s)]
*  So if you want people from the ground, so they tell you. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2813.96s)]
*  I will. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2816.04s)]
*  Of course, it's going to be like Hamas propaganda and all of that. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2816.6s)]
*  And also, what's really have been bothering me about all of this is the reset. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2819.8799999999997s)]
*  It's as if the media is living its own Groundhog Day. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2824.68s)]
*  Everything resets, right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2830.3599999999997s)]
*  Western media has the attention of a TikTok algorithm. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2832.2799999999997s)]
*  Every discussion starts from zero. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2834.8399999999997s)]
*  Every crime exists in a vacuum. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2836.52s)]
*  Every pattern is like, oh my God, those Israelis had really bad luck with these accidental [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2838.36s)]
*  hospital bombing. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2843.8s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2844.6s)]
*  Forty hospitals bombed and we discussed 41 as it's a new development. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2845.56s)]
*  It's like covering a serial killer, new 20th victim without checking the 19 victims in [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2849.96s)]
*  the freezer. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2855.4s)]
*  This is not covering the story. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2856.44s)]
*  This is covering up the story. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2857.88s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2859.88s)]
*  Nobody, nobody believes you, Israel. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2861.24s)]
*  Nobody believes you. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2865.4s)]
*  Nobody likes you. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2866.84s)]
*  No matter how much media cover a covers for you, no matter how much politicians you buy [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2868.52s)]
*  to parrot your talking points, no matter how many fake influencer you hire to whitewash [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2873.8s)]
*  your face, no matter how many fake Indian based accounts that tweets for you, no matter [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2879.08s)]
*  how many European models you bring in and you pay them so they can dance with the IDF [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2884.76s)]
*  uniform, right? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2888.6800000000003s)]
*  That everybody can see you. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2889.96s)]
*  Everybody can smell your bullshit, right? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2891.56s)]
*  You are like the neighbor who firebombs everybody's house and he said, well, he's not invited [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2893.88s)]
*  to a house party, right? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2898.76s)]
*  You will win in the battlefield. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2900.44s)]
*  You will get more land because America supports you. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2901.88s)]
*  It's like supporting a rabid dog that shits on your loans and eats your cats and bites [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2904.6800000000003s)]
*  everybody. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2909.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's like, oh, just like you have a bad day. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2909.7200000000003s)]
*  You will win maybe on the battlefield, but everybody knows who you are. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2911.96s)]
*  A bunch of heartless psychopathic, demonic assholes. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2915.96s)]
*  And that's I don't have anything to say. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2921.48s)]
*  Is that the end of the debate, Piers? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2923.88s)]
*  That's the final statement of this. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2925.7200000000003s)]
*  If you want to have a final word very quickly, by all means. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2927.32s)]
*  I'll try to say something positive. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2932.92s)]
*  Despite that very foul language and what he just said, I will gladly invite you and your [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2935.7200000000003s)]
*  grandchildren to come visit Israel in 70 years. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2943.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe you and I won't be here, but maybe our grandchildren will. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2947.56s)]
*  They will come to see a flourishing, democratic, free, prosperous society that despite the [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2951.3199999999997s)]
*  actions of the people like you, despite our enemies, despite naysayers, despite haters [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2957.9599999999996s)]
*  and many other people, they will see that we will continue to live in our ancestral [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2964.04s)]
*  homeland. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2969.56s)]
*  We will continue to nourish it and love it and we will continue to prosper and live here [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2970.2s)]
*  despite people like you. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2975.8799999999997s)]
*  But I would also like in 70 years time to see exactly the same for the people in Gaza [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2977.8799999999997s)]
*  who are Palestinians. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2982.8399999999997s)]
*  I would like to see that kind of utopia for them as well. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2989.08s)]
*  So would I. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2991.56s)]
*  For them to enjoy the same human rights that you and I enjoy. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2992.04s)]
*  I've got to leave it there. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2995.56s)]
*  So would I, but that's their choice. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2996.3599999999997s)]
*  All right, we've got to leave it there. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=2998.52s)]
*  Jonathan, you had a good amount of time to speak as did Bassem. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v555ZnQVQ&t=3000.12s)]
