*  I remember when I was in Gaza and I've watched some of you know your debates and you know you were saying that you're having a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=0.0s)]
*  Moral quandary over what was going on. It's not a moral quandary for me [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4.88s)]
*  I'm putting headless children and I'm handing them over to mothers and they're hugging them and they're putting them in their body bags [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=8.52s)]
*  Smodrich and Ben-Gavir in particular. Yeah, I've made it clear [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=14.88s)]
*  They want to clear out Gaza of all the Palestinians [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=17.92s)]
*  She's a war crimes ethnic cleanser in support of Jewish settlements in Gaza. You said there should be another Nakba [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  You also said I'm personally proud of the ruins of Gaza. You said I don't care about Gaza [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  I literally don't care at all. You say that Smodrich and Ben-Gavir they're the right wingers [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=33.94s)]
*  You're sounding pretty right-wing yourself. I'm a right-winger as well. I'm a right-winger as well. Absolutely [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=40.4s)]
*  It was almost like a comedy sketch if it wasn't so serious there [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=45.4s)]
*  You are saying you don't believe any of the stories of the Israelis shooting at people here and next thing here is a machine gun going off [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=49.36s)]
*  Come on Colonel Kemp take your blinkers off man. All I can say is thank God that there was no Piers Morgan uncensored during World War two [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=56.44s)]
*  President Trump wants a ceasefire in the Israel Hamas war and he wants it to be as soon as this week [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=64.84s)]
*  Well, frankly can't come soon enough [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=69.22s)]
*  Thousands of Palestinians have been killed since the last ceasefire broke down including a series of shocking incidents at aid centers [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=70.98s)]

*  This weekend Israeli settlers attacked an Israeli military base in the Israeli occupied West Bank [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=82.82s)]
*  Your position says they were emboldened by expansionist hardliners in Netanyahu's government [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=88.66s)]
*  We're coming up [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=93.88s)]
*  I'll talk to one of the most controversial ministers in Israel's government and we'll debate the terms of what happens next [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=94.53999999999999s)]

*  That name and it's just kind of stuck ever since and then you know [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  It was my Instagram handle for such a long time and then I started to go viral [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=130.38s)]
*  I know I thought it was too late to change it then so yeah, I guess I'm the beast from the Middle East [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=133.38s)]
*  We're gonna get to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=137.54s)]
*  Incredible stuff you've done in Gaza, but you were telling me off camera is fascinating [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=139.01999999999998s)]

*  Do you know Gaza is an extremely difficult place to go into I've been there now multiple times since the start of this war [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=180.02s)]
*  I remember, you know the first time going in there, you know, we arrived at about six o'clock and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=185.5s)]

*  And I remember opening up the body bags because the other extended family were there to identify the bodies [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=195.22s)]
*  and you know when you just open up body bags and it's organs of children missing heads missing limbs 80% body burns and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=200.74s)]
*  you know, there were family members coming in picking up pieces of an arm and identifying the body just by the ring and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  You know that was literally the first 30 minutes [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=216.58s)]
*  I was in Gaza and instantly, you know that this is something that's you'll never be prepared for something [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=218.92000000000002s)]

*  Not not to this scale not to this scale the level of destruction, you know [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=226.58s)]
*  We would drive, you know, we would drive from the European Hospital to NASA Hospital [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=230.02s)]
*  They were and there would be about four buildings standing and it was just rubble and people were living in and amongst this rubble [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, it was really and you know, the drones are constantly overhead [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  Every day children are coming in injured killed burnt alive and that's constant and and you know [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=244.34s)]
*  There's always the risk that you could be killed as well [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=250.62s)]
*  I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=253.04s)]
*  Mean it sounds extraordinary [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  When you say that children are coming in every day literally all the time [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=256.71999999999997s)]

*  To go back nine months later and still see children starving to death [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=292.32s)]
*  That's what really hits home is when you see that how prolonged and sustained this campaign of violence and you know violence against children [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=296.24s)]

*  And it's not a moral quandary for millions of people around the world [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=429.98s)]
*  Like we're sat here and I'm putting headless children and I'm handing them over to mothers and they're hugging them and they're putting them [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=432.38s)]

*  so [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  You know just to put it in a context the first 24 days of this conflict [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=463.5s)]
*  1900 children were killed in the first 24 days [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=469.2s)]
*  That's more than any other conflict anywhere around the world in a whole year and in this tiny population of Gaza [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=471.68s)]
*  And I think anybody like me or any Palestinians or anyone really that knows the situation [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  They knew what was coming and we knew what was happening when they were calling [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=483.32s)]
*  You know them human animals and amelek and we're gonna cut off food water and electricity and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=486.36s)]
*  1900 children killed in in a dozen or so days [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  I think we all knew what was coming when you say you knew what was coming [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, just to be clear my moral quandary was really [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=498.72s)]
*  That I felt after October the 7th Israel didn't just have a right to defend itself at a duty [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=502.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, a terror attack of that scale. You know 1200 people killed. Yeah, nearly 7,000 more wounded [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=507.8s)]
*  Yeah, 250 plus kidnapped grandmothers babies. I mean Holocaust survivors [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  On such a horrific scale obviously Israel was going to respond with force. Yeah [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  Mike Mike quandary was simply at what point is this a proportionate response? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=526.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I didn't know the answer. Yeah, I do now. Yes, you know [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=531.28s)]
*  I've been saying for a few months now that what is happening now is [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=534.92s)]
*  Beyond yeah to me any kind of proportionate response and it seems to be never-ending [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=538.8s)]
*  That's why this has to end [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=544.9599999999999s)]
*  But take going back to October the 7th [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=547.2800000000001s)]
*  Notwithstanding obviously you're the son of a Garzum refugee and of course that will inform how you view things but [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=550.2s)]
*  None of this would be happening in the way it's been happening without what Hamas did that day [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  So what do you feel about what Hamas inflicted on its own people by doing what it did? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=563.12s)]
*  Many of us carry around bulky worn-out wallets that are uncomfortable and full of junk [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=570.44s)]
*  The big question is why Ridge wallets can hold 12 cars plus cash with zero bulk [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  They're made from premium materials like aluminum titanium and carbon fiber and they're built with RFID blocking technology [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=580.4s)]
*  The differential cars against digital theft Ridge offers a lifetime warranty [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  So this might be the last wallet you ever need the same lifetime guarantee applies to their key cases [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  Suitcases and rings all of them come with free shipping and a 99-day trial for a limited time [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  Get 10% off at Ridge by using code Piers P I E R S at checkout [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=603.6s)]
*  They're sent to Ridge.com and use code Piers after you purchase [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=608.72s)]
*  They will ask you where you heard about them. So please support our show and tell them I sent you [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=613.52s)]
*  So I think the framing of that is a little bit problematic like what Hamas did to its own people [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=619.44s)]
*  What what's been going on is didn't start on October the 7th in 75 years and I can detest to that because I was definitely [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=624.84s)]
*  Cleansed out of cars and so was my family, you know, so it didn't start on October 7th [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=631.8s)]
*  What do I think about October 7th horrific, you know [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=636.28s)]
*  taking of women and children as [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  hostages killing innocent people [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=641.92s)]
*  As a Palestinian, I know how much that hurts [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=644.3599999999999s)]
*  So all I have is nothing but sympathy for the people who suffered on October the 7th [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, you know [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  People started this story on October the 7th and for me growing up in poverty [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=654.64s)]
*  Growing up without running water in the house growing up watching, you know [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=659.5799999999999s)]
*  I was have to give up our savings all the time to support family back in Gaza and back [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=663.78s)]
*  For me, it never started on October the 7th for me [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=669.9399999999999s)]
*  It started every day when I was being bullied at school [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  It started when and I had to move from city to city because my dad never got a permanent job [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=674.18s)]
*  You know, those are the kind of things where you know, I look at it and I was just there was a lot of emotions on [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=679.74s)]
*  October the 7th, you know as a Palestinian [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=685.5s)]
*  Did any part of you feel it was justified? I've heard some people categorize what they did as [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=687.62s)]
*  Resistance, which is a justification for what happened. I don't think you can do that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=693.34s)]
*  I mean to me it was an appalling [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=698.58s)]
*  terrorist attack and the reason I framed the question the way I did was that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=700.42s)]
*  When it later turned out that Hamas had this huge tunnel system where they all hid [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=704.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but the civilians were left to be under the raining bombs from Israel [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=708.94s)]
*  Which were inevitably gonna come yeah given the scale of what her mass did [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=715.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I meant by the way, I phrased the question which is how much to Palestinian people [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=719.18s)]
*  When they look back on that, how much do they blame her mass for the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=724.78s)]
*  Inevitably bringing this on them. Yeah, I mean look before her mass [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=729.62s)]
*  It was the PLO right, you know and before the PLO it was the Egyptians and before then it was somebody else [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=733.1s)]
*  Look at the end of the day the root cause is the problem. The root cause is the occupation the root cause is inequality [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=739.3s)]
*  The root cause is that I don't have the right to return to my home [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=745.5s)]
*  That my father doesn't have the right to return that my grandfather is buried in Gaza. My dad's never been able to go see him [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=748.46s)]
*  You know [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=755.9399999999999s)]
*  When we talk about the root cause it when we talk about, you know, what Hamas did on October the 7th [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=757.34s)]
*  This is just a cycle and the cycle always comes back to instead of looking at the symptoms [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=762.3s)]
*  I don't want to look at the symptoms [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=767.02s)]
*  I want to look at the causes the causes is inequality is a lack of justice [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=768.06s)]
*  I just want justice for the Palestinian people and I don't want that justice to be violence and killing of innocent Israelis [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=771.96s)]
*  You want the same human rights? I just want the same human rights. Yeah, do you think it's possible? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=777.96s)]
*  I mean, I liken it sometimes to what happened in Northern Ireland where for decades people thought this could never get resolved [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=782.0s)]
*  People living amongst each other. Yep, you know loyalists and IRA [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=789.76s)]
*  But eventually they got there. Yeah, they got to peace [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=794.9200000000001s)]
*  Do you think it's possible to end up with a two-state solution where Palestinians live with the same rights as Israelis? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=797.6s)]
*  Well, look, I think the Israelis are making it very difficult to have a two-state solution [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=803.88s)]
*  You know with the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and moving in which is appalling which is moving in millions of settlers [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=807.28s)]
*  It's making a two-state solution impossible [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=812.38s)]
*  Really what's gonna happen is eventually there'll be a one-state solution with equality for Muslims and Jews and anybody else living on that land [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=814.0s)]
*  and eventually Palestinians will have the right to return and [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=820.68s)]
*  They will return back to Palestine and I feel like [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=824.04s)]
*  you know [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=827.56s)]
*  it's kind of ironic really because they've avoided so much in giving the Palestinians a state and a home and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=828.3599999999999s)]
*  They've tried to destroy this two-state solution that eventually what will happen is a one-state solution [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=834.28s)]
*  and eventually the majority that they've tried to build by ethnically cleansing by taking up more and more land will go away because eventually the [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=838.3s)]
*  Palestinians will return home and eventually given all the Palestinian refugees all around the world eventually the Palestinians will outnumber the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=844.7199999999999s)]
*  You know the Jewish population and that's I think what's worrying them [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=852.28s)]
*  And I think what needs to happen is is there either needs to be a conversation where you need to have a proper two-state solution [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=855.08s)]
*  Or it needs to be a one-state solution [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=860.48s)]
*  But questions need to be asked and governments need to come in and help because we do Arab countries do enough [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=862.24s)]
*  It seems to me they kind of hold back and say this is not our problem. Well [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  You know look Jordan has taken in millions of refugees more than half the population of Palestinian [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=873.32s)]
*  Lebanon has had civil wars with Palestinian resistance fighters in there before and you know Syria has its own problems [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=878.4799999999999s)]
*  Egypt has you know my dad was educated in Egypt Egypt has taken in loads of Palestinian refugees before the the problem isn't [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=886.12s)]
*  The Arabs they are it is problematic [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=892.8399999999999s)]
*  You know the lack of help and the lack of support, but the problem is is here is that we have a expansionist regime [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=894.9s)]
*  Which is extremely right-wing within Israel that doesn't protect that doesn't respect any borders [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=902.64s)]
*  Doesn't respect anyone so that is now talking in openly genocidal language [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=909.0s)]
*  I mean smodrich and Ben Gavir in particular. Yeah, I've made it clear [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  They want to clear out the Gaza of all the Palestinians. Yeah. Yeah, exactly [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=916.32s)]
*  Which is a war crime is ethnic cleansing. It is it is it is and you know, that's why and you know [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=920.88s)]
*  The UN has been gutted as well. It's been defunded. It's been gutted. It's been delegitimized [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=927.12s)]
*  what I've been doing since I got back from Gaza is if I've been trying to come up with solutions for what's going on and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=932.64s)]
*  You know, I've been traveling around the world trying to get support for a children's hospital in Gaza [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=939.6s)]
*  It's a children's hospital that we're gonna build in Jordan. So the infrastructure is there in place already ready [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=944.08s)]
*  We're gonna build it in Jordan and drive it into Gaza and have a mobile hospital essentially. It's a hospital on wheels [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=949.72s)]
*  It has an intensive care unit wards pathology labs pharmacies. It's solar panel powered [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=954.84s)]
*  It has running sewerage waterworks and and you know, I've got the proposal here. It's ready to go and [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=959.68s)]
*  I'm in the final stages of negotiations with the Minjuru Foundation to get funding for this hospital [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=966.64s)]
*  We have a similar concept of this a maternity and neonatal hospital, which is ready to go into Gaza as well [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=971.5999999999999s)]
*  the reason why I'm saying that [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=976.8s)]
*  Why I've come with solutions and not just here just to talk and just rhetoric and you know people being unhappy and victim and this this [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=978.8399999999999s)]
*  I want a solution to this women and children are dying women and children are being funneled into cages and gunned down hungry women [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=986.92s)]
*  And children you can't have an army that's on trial for genocide to be also the one that controls [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=993.48s)]
*  Access to do you believe the IDF for deliberately killing civilians? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=999.68s)]
*  Because they always say we're deliberately killing Hamas and civilians are dying in the process of us going after Hamas [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1004.16s)]
*  What do you say to that? Well, I'd say that they could you know, they killed their own hostages with a newer waving white flags [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1010.98s)]
*  They have bombed hospitals with people inside them. They left babies in incubators to rot to death [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1017.0s)]
*  When they executed those 15 paramedics [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1024.8s)]
*  I was in Gaza then when they executed 15 paramedics and buried them alive and lied about it and lied about it. I [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1027.44s)]
*  Was there when I would have children coming in with explosive injuries and they would have bread in their hand [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1034.36s)]
*  They were eating and they targeted them when they were eating [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1041.12s)]
*  I would pick up children as young as two years old that had been shot in the head by snipers multiple times [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1043.8s)]
*  So, you know when they talk about saying that then they're only going after Hamas [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1050.48s)]
*  I mean you said it yourself. They've openly talked about ethnically cleansing the whole of gada [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1054.2s)]
*  They're actively expanding settlements in the West Bank. They say her master in all the hospitals. Yeah, that's right [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1057.96s)]
*  Look, I've worked in all the hospitals [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1063.48s)]
*  It'd be a very stupid thing to to have a military base in us [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1065.24s)]
*  But one it's open access policy everyone can walk in and out of the hospital [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1068.24s)]
*  Also, the hospital is full of injured women and children the hospitals full of media and also the hospital is a base where all [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1072.4s)]
*  The international aid workers are and you know my concern when I go to Gaza is the children in Gaza. That's my concern [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1078.24s)]
*  I don't want to be I don't want you know [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1083.96s)]
*  There'd be any military operations out of there because it puts children in danger [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1085.72s)]
*  But you know, I've not heard of a doctor that's come out and said that they've actively seen [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1088.72s)]
*  Fighting or rockets being fired out of a hospital. It's not to say that something might have happened before [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1093.2s)]
*  But again, you still can't throw the baby away with the dirty baby water [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1097.9199999999998s)]
*  It's a hospital and if you're gonna bomb and destroy hospitals, which they've bombed 36 hospitals [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1103.04s)]
*  Then let me bring in my hospital. Let me bring in this and what I'm trying to do with this hospital is I'm trying [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1107.28s)]
*  To make this a government led initiative. I want the British government on board. I've I've got the Irish government on board [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1111.8s)]
*  You know, we met with President Michael Higgins. We've [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1117.56s)]
*  We've got the Australian government talking about this [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1121.36s)]
*  We went to France yesterday to try and get the French government on board instead of having the Israelis running the aid [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1124.0s)]
*  I want our governments to take a more active role. I don't want them to pay for this [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1130.68s)]
*  I want them just to give us the access to get this hospital in and to allow British doctors Australian doctors Irish doctors [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1134.56s)]
*  Canadian doctors in to have our hospital. This is our aid distribution center [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1142.16s)]
*  You know just last week or a couple of weeks ago [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1146.52s)]
*  The first children of Gaza arrived here in the UK two of them arrived [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  that's the first time since this war started that two children had arrived, yep, and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1153.46s)]
*  You know, they're not bringing any more in and I understand why the government don't want to bring more children in one [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1158.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, you saw the race riots that happened in August in my town in Middlesbrough [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1162.66s)]
*  People were pulled out of their cars if they were Muslim mosques were vandalized asylum seekers hotels were burned down [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1167.7s)]
*  I know for the government. It's a touchy subject to bring in black and brown children into the UK [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1173.58s)]
*  Well, this is a way we avoid that instead of bringing them here to be treated [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1178.1s)]
*  Let's bring a hospital here and you know, it's not just the hospital that I've got [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1181.6200000000001s)]
*  I've also got a plan here to feed the children of Gaza with instant aid [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1184.88s)]
*  This is a comprehensive two-year plan that not just looks after feeds the children [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1189.6200000000001s)]
*  It feeds them twice a day nutrient rich meals [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1195.22s)]
*  This has been designed by executives that have worked for the World Food Program and USA aid [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1197.74s)]
*  This is a pious projects hospital as well [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1202.26s)]
*  Like I've got the answers here I've been speaking to government figures. I just need them to listen to me. I'm about to interview [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1205.4199999999998s)]
*  one of the Israeli government [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1211.82s)]
*  What would be your message for her? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1214.02s)]
*  Tax day has passed but for millions of Americans, that's where the trouble begins [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1217.3799999999999s)]
*  The IRS is now ramping up enforcement for those who miss the April deadline or still owe back taxes [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1221.1s)]
*  Well today's sponsor tax Network USA can still help if your books are a mess [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1227.54s)]
*  Your self-employed or if you're a business owner tax Network USA [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1233.1599999999999s)]

*  They say the IRS is applying enforcement pressure at levels. They've never seen before but even after the deadline [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1242.6399999999999s)]

*  look [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1281.0s)]
*  Why are you laughing when you say that? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1282.4s)]
*  It's kind of like a black mirror episode, you know, sometimes it's parody, you know, it's a parody [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1284.44s)]
*  I think like everyone's watching what you know in Glastonbury just then what's happened in Glastonbury, you know the chance right death death to the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1289.44s)]
*  IDF, right? What did you think of that? Well, you know what I thought of that [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1295.3400000000001s)]
*  It's just like, you know [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1298.6000000000001s)]
*  They are more concerned and more outraged by a chant than the actual crimes of the idea. Can't you be outraged by both? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1299.56s)]
*  As I was look you can be outraged by both watching thousands of people at an English music festival. Yeah [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1306.72s)]
*  chanting death to the IDF [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1312.92s)]
*  I found that very unsettling and I'm not Jewish. Yeah, if I was a British Jew watching that I would feel very very [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1315.44s)]
*  unnerved that a British audience like that and the irony that of course [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1323.0s)]
*  Hamas had [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1328.1200000000001s)]
*  Obliterated young people at a music festival. Yep. Yep on October the 7th [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1329.52s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't like that and I think it's perfectly possible to think that is outrageous [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1333.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but it's also perfectly possible to criticize Israeli government for what they're doing in Gaza [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1336.48s)]
*  I mean, I mean look you're asking the wrong person about about that because I've had [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1341.12s)]
*  Family members killed for generations by the IDF. I've had my home destroyed my village burnt down by the IDF [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1345.6799999999998s)]
*  I've helped children who were riddled in bullets by the IDF. I've had to have children in a corner [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1351.0s)]
*  Where that while their mother? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1358.56s)]
*  Bled out to them on the floor and covered their own children in her blood as she died because of IDF bullets and IDF bombs [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1360.52s)]
*  So, you know when you ask these questions like why you asking a Palestinian who's been I'll tell you why because for example when the Iraq war [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1366.6200000000001s)]
*  Happened. Yes, my brother was a serving officer [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1373.78s)]
*  Yes, for example, my issue was not with him my issue. I campaigned against it [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1375.9s)]
*  Yes, it was a daily mirror. Yes, my issue is with Tony Blair and the Labor government that ordered him [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1380.66s)]
*  Yeah, and his colleagues into battle. Yeah, so I think blaming soldiers in war [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1385.52s)]
*  Yeah, is it's chicken and the egg they're being ordered into battle. Yes to do what they do [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1390.5s)]
*  By their governments look I hear you. I hear you. I hear your concerns and look I hear you too [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1396.5s)]
*  Oh, yes, if I'd lost a lot of family members to idea [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1401.82s)]
*  I would probably feel the same way you do what I say is this look at you [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1405.46s)]
*  I I don't agree with any form of the violence and death chance. I'm a doctor [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1409.06s)]
*  I try and bring life to this world right to stay in life [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1414.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't want anyone to die [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1416.02s)]
*  But when you're an IDF soldier who is wearing putting on dead women's lingerie in Palestine tying children's teddy bears onto tanks [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1416.94s)]
*  When you're leaving babies to rot in incubators when you are laughing as you're blowing up schools and hospitals [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1425.46s)]
*  There is going to be backlash and what happens at these music festivals is they're reflective of how society feels whether that's right or wrong [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1433.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm not here to comment on that [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1440.5s)]
*  But I'm just saying that like if the government was more proactive people wouldn't feel this rage and I don't want people to feel rage [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1441.9s)]
*  I don't want death. All right, because I've had a lot of death in my family [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1448.3600000000001s)]
*  I've had a lot of a lot of issues in my life because of this issue [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1451.46s)]
*  I want there to be peace. I want both sides to come together [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1455.42s)]
*  I don't want to see Jewish people suffering and dying [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1458.3000000000002s)]
*  But I don't want to see Palestinians either suffering and dying and all I want is I want to bring in my hospital [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1460.22s)]
*  And I want to feed the children and I've you know, I've got the solutions here. I've got them here [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1465.26s)]
*  I've got people are watching miss and listen to you. I just need someone to listen [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1469.54s)]
*  Will you be going back to Gaza while the war's still on? I [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1472.7s)]
*  My forms are submitted. I should be going back into Gaza whether I'm allowed back in or not [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1477.14s)]
*  Considering all the noise that I've made about the well you were on the Greta Thunberg [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1481.66s)]
*  Flotilla which I was very critical of her. Yeah, because I'm not a big fan of her [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1486.26s)]
*  I thought it was all a bit of a virtue seedling [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1490.18s)]
*  Twaddle if I'm honest, but I didn't know you obviously I found you a very impressive person to interview [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1493.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but did that really achieve anything or was it not just another of Greta's stunts? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1498.5s)]
*  Which really is about her but doesn't really achieve anything [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1502.38s)]
*  so look what I'll tell you to that right here is you know, I was invited to come down to [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1505.3s)]
*  You know see the guys at the flotilla and and and have my voice there as a doctor that had been to Gaza [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1509.86s)]
*  Like you, you know, I've watched Greta over the years. I wasn't sure either, you know [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1515.4599999999998s)]
*  But when I was there and I saw them get onto the boat Greta was crying [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1520.34s)]
*  She her mother was there. Her family was there [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1525.4199999999998s)]
*  There was real concern that she could be killed here and there was concerned by the other flotilla members [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1528.54s)]
*  you know, it was a very somber moment when they left because family members were hugging there was tears and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1532.74s)]
*  There was because I was there before they got onto the boat and there was all the precautionary stuff of people writing their last letters [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1538.8200000000002s)]
*  Their last messages. I mean, this is real, you know the flotilla before them three weeks three weeks ago had been bombed by drones [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1545.7s)]
*  15 years ago ten people on the flotilla killed right you're talking about sailing in in a [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1551.94s)]
*  ship an unarmed ship carrying baby formula [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1559.02s)]
*  To a to go into the heart of a genocide with an army that doesn't respect international law [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1562.94s)]
*  I mean to be fair to Greta right here as much criticism you can have she's really brave for what she did and [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1569.98s)]
*  I know people might have this in there [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1576.0200000000002s)]
*  but it's real they really wanted to break the siege and they've made the whole world talk about this illegal siege because the siege has [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1578.3400000000001s)]
*  Been going on for 18 years in Gaza and that has been locked by see [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1583.5800000000002s)]
*  I just don't think anybody knew was thinking about it. It wasn't already was my point [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1588.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I can respect that and I also just think look people have different ways of expressing their views [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1592.74s)]
*  My ways of expressing it is to try and get something done [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1598.82s)]
*  Yeah, other people is to perform protests like that that gain media attention. Whatever it is [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1601.1s)]
*  I just want the killing to stop [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1605.8s)]
*  Yeah, and I think everybody has a role to play even Greta has a role to play and and this is why I'm here [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1607.3s)]
*  Even you do as well peers. I know when I was a kid because I used to watch [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1612.78s)]
*  You know you on TV and I know that you were the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1616.44s)]
*  You led the anti-war movement or one of the main figures that led the anti-war you came under a lot of stick [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1620.8s)]
*  You were attacked a lot and I remember as a kid looking up at you looking up to you [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1625.44s)]
*  And you know as a Muslim watching this white man, you know say that this is wrong and you were challenging a media narrative [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1629.96s)]
*  We didn't have social media back then you didn't have the public support that you have now for the Palestine cause and [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1636.28s)]
*  You were under a lot of attack and your voice is so important because you were such a powerful voice in 2003 to stop [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1641.6000000000001s)]

*  I need no persuading about Gaza. I think this has gone on way too long. The death toll is way too high [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1652.64s)]
*  Yeah, the number of innocent people being killed on a daily basis is completely unacceptable [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1659.0s)]
*  And I will be saying all this to the Israeli government minister in a moment, but Mohammed I believe there. Thank you very much [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1664.0s)]
*  It's been a real pleasure to meet you. Yeah, we appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's great [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1670.4399999999998s)]

*  Well, joining me now is Mike Olin the Minister for Social Equality in Benjamin Netanyahu's government. Welcome to you miss Godin [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1681.6399999999999s)]
*  You were listening to that but you were grimacing and pulling faces. What was your issue with what you heard? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1688.04s)]
*  Now parts of first of all, thank you for having me mr. Morgan [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1694.84s)]
*  I was here in parts because I was talking with my staff here [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1698.52s)]
*  But for some of the things I heard some were just absolute lies [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1702.28s)]
*  The idea is happy when he's bombing hospitals or schools really a country and a nation who suffered the Holocaust [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1707.32s)]
*  And lost six million people is is happy about hunger and is trying to use that as a method [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1715.1200000000001s)]
*  And also I was trying really trying so hard to listen to one word of him saying [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1721.44s)]
*  About the captives that we have about the hostages that we have the 50 hostages that weren't released [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1728.1200000000001s)]
*  I didn't hear anything not even a word and [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1733.3600000000001s)]
*  I can understand the suffering. Of course I can trust me. Mr. Morgan. No one wants to see [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1736.3600000000001s)]
*  Children died children hurt. No one wants that let alone the Israeli people who suffered what they did [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1742.6000000000001s)]
*  but [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1748.16s)]
*  For them to say that we are doing it in order to hurt [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1749.44s)]
*  Specifically innocent civilians is an absolute lie. I can tell you and I hear this with respect minister [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1753.5800000000002s)]
*  I hear this from a lot of [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1760.42s)]
*  Israeli government members ambassadors lawyers and so on and my point is always the same is that [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1762.22s)]
*  Even if we accept that nobody in the IDF has ever deliberately targeted a child [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1768.66s)]
*  Which is contradicted by a lot of witnesses, but even if you accept that premise you have to also agree that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1774.66s)]
*  20,000 children [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1781.98s)]
*  Maybe many more that's just the ones that we believe is the number have been killed as [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1784.22s)]
*  You've gone after Hamas and it's it's a staggering number of children innocent kids [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1790.26s)]
*  You've been killed here and just on a human level. Well surely surely you must accept that this has now gone on [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1795.6200000000001s)]
*  enough [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1802.8600000000001s)]
*  First of all on a human level I can tell you not 100% 1 million percent that [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1805.02s)]
*  We take no pleasure whatsoever not in seeing anyone [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1811.46s)]
*  Innocent in Gaza who died let alone our holy and hero soldiers and our innocent people [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1815.58s)]
*  But let's put some things in perspective and I would like to answer that [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1821.6200000000001s)]
*  You know as as much as I can that would satisfy you because hearing the interview before it seems like you're coming from one side [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1825.14s)]
*  And I can I don't say so the amount of videos. I'm not on any one side as you as you probably [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1832.8600000000001s)]
*  Listen as you probably know at the start of all this for many months [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1837.9s)]
*  I was the one being attacked by the pro-palestinian [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1841.82s)]
*  Guests who came on because they didn't like the fact that I was supporting Israel's right to defend itself [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1845.46s)]
*  And in fact said it had a moral duty. I just heard this so just because I'm not criticizing the Israeli government [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1850.54s)]
*  Let's not pretend that somehow I'm changing sides. I was never on anybody's side [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1857.02s)]
*  No, I try and be an objective when I heard when I heard that when I heard that [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1861.78s)]
*  Recorded just now that that interview you said to him specifically [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1868.18s)]
*  No one needs to persuade me about Gaza [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1872.9s)]
*  So right I think that when you see the okay, mr [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1875.5s)]
*  Morgan let me answer when you see videos and when you see pictures, which I'm sure you get a mass of them [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1878.78s)]
*  Okay, you have to remember those videos and pictures don't come from the moon, right? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1883.48s)]
*  They're coming from people who take videos there. Everyone has mobiles phones smartphones [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1887.62s)]
*  So obviously some of those videos could be reflected to one side [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1892.06s)]
*  I suggest I really do suggest you see some of the videos of the horrors that happened on October 7 [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1896.74s)]
*  Of the horrors that happen in one second one second. You saw the 40-minute video [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1903.54s)]
*  You saw the 40-minute video of the horrors [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1908.42s)]
*  Yes, if you saw that if you did saw that and I just let me just tell you that it's just a part [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1910.9s)]
*  It's just a part. Yes [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1916.18s)]
*  I know we could have shown because the majority was horrible if you saw that you can't stay [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1917.3s)]
*  Calm in yourself and relax about what Israel and the Jewish nation have to endure for the last 75 years [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1922.5s)]
*  We have women that are being slaughtered and raped in the most brutal way [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1929.42s)]
*  I'm as the minister for social equality and the advancement of women with I just heard [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1933.88s)]
*  You're the person that you interviewed mocking about it and laughing about what he was laughing about [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1938.14s)]
*  You must have miscaracterized it okay the point he was making [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1946.46s)]
*  And he's an extremely courageous doctor who risked his own life several times now to go and work in hospitals in Gaza as the bombs are dropping [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1952.18s)]
*  So I won't have you attacking him [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1960.54s)]
*  I wish you would have told you that Israel has suggested more than a hundred incubators to the Shifa hospitals [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1962.54s)]
*  And to the authorities of Khamansi they refused it [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1967.8200000000002s)]
*  I wish you would have told you that many hospitals [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1969.8200000000002s)]
*  Mr. Morgan one second I wish you would have told you that many hospitals underground have facilities of terror [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1973.26s)]
*  I wish you would have told you that schools and and and places of humanitarian aid which by the way we the the country that have [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1979.98s)]
*  Massacred in her holiday has been given over 70,000 eight trucks. Do you hear that? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1987.78s)]
*  He's talking about a hot let me respond what country does that a country that that has a woman being chopped off into pieces and babies [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=1995.1399999999999s)]
*  Being chopped off into pieces men beheaded elderly people are being kidnapped. Do you know what we had to watch? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2002.6599999999999s)]
*  Talking about what the what the gods are beat through but what about the Jewish nation that has been that have buses been blowing up for the last 70 years? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2009.22s)]
*  Yes, okay. Let me respond as I said to you. Yes for a long time in this war [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2016.6599999999999s)]
*  I defended Israel's right to defend itself, but that right to self-defense has now been [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2021.86s)]
*  Consumed by senior members of your government your colleagues [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2028.02s)]
*  Smodrich Ben-Gavir and others [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2032.8999999999999s)]
*  Extreme right-wing members of that government who are now talking in a very brazen and very open way about what they really want to happen [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2035.3s)]
*  Which is in their words cleansing Gaza of all Palestinians that is ethnic cleansing [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2043.14s)]
*  That is a war crime. So you may not say that or maybe you will but your colleagues are saying that and they want to cleanse [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2049.38s)]
*  Gaza as they put it of all [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2057.58s)]
*  Palestinians that is not self-defense that is ethnic cleansing [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2060.02s)]
*  So you can play the moral argument against me about October the seventh, but it's [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2064.22s)]
*  Let me explain I have said repeatedly but if I may finish my sentence I have for 20 [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2071.34s)]
*  Okay, but don't get angry I hear you on you're the one getting angry I'm trying to get a word in I'm not [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2081.5s)]

*  Anyone who's watched my show will tell you I suspect you haven't watched it much or you wouldn't be questioning [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2091.62s)]
*  What I feel about October the seventh to me [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2097.3799999999997s)]
*  It was one of the most heinous terror attacks of modern times an absolutely despicable assault on [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2099.8599999999997s)]
*  predominantly innocent women children [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2107.14s)]
*  Grandmothers grandfathers in the most repulsive [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2110.06s)]
*  Horrific atrocious manner and I Hamas to me are a disgusting terrorist organization [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2113.6200000000003s)]
*  Who lost any right to govern for another second in Gaza the moment they perpetrated that act of pure evil [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2119.9s)]
*  However, and it's an important [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2127.26s)]
*  however [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2129.2200000000003s)]
*  What the Israeli government has been doing in the last few months in Gaza has now to even its closest allies [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2129.7400000000002s)]
*  Become something they cannot defend and you know this when you do a three-month blockade of food you boast [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2136.86s)]
*  You all boast about how much age you're giving them you blocked most aid and food for three months to an already starving [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2143.14s)]
*  That is actually not [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2155.38s)]
*  To do [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2158.2599999999998s)]
*  A lie [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2160.26s)]
*  And if you let me comment you say so much accusations you have to let me comment about some of them [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2163.1400000000003s)]
*  There was no blockade start with the small twitch [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2168.34s)]
*  Okay, wait, you said a lot of things. I want to comment about all of them [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2170.94s)]
*  If you let me I would be more than happy. Okay, first of all, let's start about small twitch and Bang V [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2174.26s)]
*  What you said now? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2178.34s)]
*  Mr. Morgan, I don't need to explain to you who I have been watching his show and for day for many many and been watching your [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2179.7000000000003s)]
*  Professional career for many years by the way [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2187.66s)]
*  and and and do have [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2190.18s)]
*  Evaluation for everything that you say and for what you believe in which I think I really think you are being misled [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2192.66s)]
*  That is why I came here on this show [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2198.74s)]
*  Not because I think anything else now would be really happy if you let me finish some of the points [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2200.42s)]
*  I want to tell you first of all regarding small twitch and Bang V [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2205.08s)]
*  You have to know with all of your profession that there is two kinds of politicians one like you interviewed [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2208.98s)]
*  For instance, Naftali Bennett an interview I did watch who [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2215.44s)]
*  by accident forgot to mention that he launched a party just a month ago and [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2218.88s)]
*  Forgot to tell you that he signed so many declarations before he came [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2223.76s)]
*  before he became a prime minister and didn't held up to any of them and [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2227.88s)]
*  Forgot to tell you a lot of things but in actual fact [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2231.92s)]
*  Deceived his own people and just like the rest of them that you interviewed all melt and Barack and all those prime ministers [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2235.1600000000003s)]
*  The one thing in common that they all have is the fact that the public doesn't vote for them anymore [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2241.24s)]
*  So they're very bitter now regarding small twitch and Bangville [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2245.8399999999997s)]
*  You have to remember when you say small twitch and Bangville you're talking about and I don't know what they said [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2249.3199999999997s)]
*  But I'm referring to what you said. I'm you know trusting your words [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2254.2s)]
*  You're talking obviously about the Trump's [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2259.04s)]
*  Plan now, this is not small twitch or Bangville's plan. No [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2261.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm not talking about Trump's plan. Okay, so what so I don't know I don't know anything [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2265.76s)]
*  You're talking about what came out of their mouths [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2271.36s)]
*  They never they they want to to to kill [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2275.6800000000003s)]
*  They want to cleanse their words cleanse Gaza of all the Palestinians [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2279.76s)]
*  So when you say cleanse I can tell you that they refer [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2286.5600000000004s)]
*  To the Trump's plan and when we're talking about Trump's plan, I have to tell you that first of all [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2290.96s)]
*  Donald J Trump which is what I consider [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2298.44s)]
*  The best thing that God could have given us for a new middle-aged [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2301.6800000000003s)]
*  His collaboration with Prime Minister Netanyahu is really what we could all wish for in order to make a new Middle East [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2305.36s)]
*  But I can tell you that we are not taking anything off the table in order to just protect our civilians [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2313.4s)]
*  And our children of Israel and if we have to look at Trump's plan [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2320.26s)]
*  Which is for me as I think is thinking outside of the box [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2324.34s)]
*  And if we have to to consider other things like we have examined over the decades we will but I don't see it [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2327.42s)]
*  Is ethnic cleansing let alone so would you like would you let me ask you then? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2334.9s)]
*  Let me ask you would you like to cleanse Gaza of all the Palestinians? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2339.42s)]
*  Listen, I I don't use the terminology of you and your colleagues. That is not my term [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2344.7000000000003s)]
*  Your colleague is not my terminology just like the settlements that you mentioned [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2350.5s)]
*  It's the terminology to be clear to be clear. It's the terminology of your own [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2355.02s)]
*  Cabinet colleague, it's smodrich your finance minister. It's your colleague not mine or my colleagues [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2359.58s)]
*  It's the language used by your finance minister only two weeks ago. I [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2366.58s)]
*  Can tell you the for the first thing first time ever we have a very right-wing [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2372.26s)]
*  Government as you can see our views are very transparent and everything that is held in the in the in the cabinet and in the [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2377.1000000000004s)]
*  Not in the cabinet, but in the government is being sheared outside. No one is hiding anything now smotlich and Ben [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2385.86s)]
*  We are not a part of my [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2391.76s)]
*  party, but they are a part of [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2393.86s)]
*  The of this government and I'm telling you and although I'm not representing them that they are talking about the Trump's plan and we are [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2395.94s)]
*  Considering it just like we consider any other plan in order to protect our civilians [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2404.3599999999997s)]
*  I want to say another thing about that. Listen, I don't know [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2408.08s)]
*  I hear your interviews and I know you talk about smotlich and his things that he said but I want to say something about [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2410.64s)]
*  But I'll smotlich although I have nothing to do with his party. Yes. He's a part of my government not from my party [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know that but smotlich went to more funerals this year than you went in your entire life [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2420.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay, he's his entire family [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2427.22s)]
*  And he's wait one second wait one second [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2430.12s)]
*  Friends because I tell you he went to hundreds and hundreds of funerals from his own community [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2435.88s)]
*  His heart was broken. We are wounded our ministers are wounded from the sights [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2440.9s)]
*  We saw I wanted to tell you before and you stopped me as the minister for social equality and the advancement of women what I saw [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2445.96s)]
*  That women have endured your eyes and your mind could never comprehend [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2452.04s)]
*  The fact is that we have children in Gaza today that the interview before was talking about that are being raised on mine [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2456.52s)]
*  Come they're being raised of killing Jews from the second they are born [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2462.68s)]
*  This is what they say and you know what if you don't believe me [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2466.6s)]
*  You can talk with that with the hostages that came back from captivity and [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2469.44s)]
*  What would you do with them? What would you do with them the Palestinians with who the Palestinians? What would you do with them? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2473.8s)]

*  This is not an issue with the terrorism of Hamas in my idea [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2484.9s)]
*  I'm asking you what you would do with the Palestinian population. What would you do with it? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2489.14s)]
*  I don't know. Would you like to accept them or we eliminate the terror of house with England accept them? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2492.58s)]
*  Well, let me let me read you maybe another let me remind you of some of the things that you've said yourself [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2496.86s)]
*  All right during an October 24 24 rally in support of Jewish settlements in Gaza [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2501.86s)]

*  You said this you want explicit violence against Hamas and Palestinians in February 2024 [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2527.94s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, eliminate every terrorist of Hamas. Let me tell you [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2535.38s)]
*  I'm not sure I'm sorry. I'm finished yet. I'm in December 2023. You said I don't care about Gaza [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2540.5s)]
*  I literally don't care at all. I [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2548.02s)]
*  Mean and I could go on reading you stuff you've had so so my point is you say that smodrich and Ben-Gavir [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2552.06s)]

*  Absolutely, would you say you're an extreme? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2563.66s)]
*  That doesn't mean I take any pleasure any pleasure of an innocent Arab man or woman or child in Gaza [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2565.7s)]
*  Suffering but the fact is that you did you all for some reason refuse to acknowledge is that Hamas is you? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2573.22s)]
*  Using them as human shields all the time [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2580.46s)]

*  Okay, thank you. I appreciate that when we had the horrifying Holocaust [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2594.92s)]
*  Do you know that we had such a thing called the righteous among the nations? Those were Christian [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2598.64s)]
*  Christian people who risked their own lives in order to save Jews now. I'm asking you mr [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2605.56s)]
*  Morgan I'm still waiting for one Gaza person one out of two million to come out and say this is where the hostages are [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2611.0s)]
*  This is where they hide or one on one of them to come and say this is where the terrorism are [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2618.26s)]

*  views are [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2629.16s)]
*  Hostages not even one now even though even though I said that I can tell you that [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2630.12s)]
*  Right now the IDF which I tell you you cannot agree. That's okay [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2635.96s)]
*  But I tell you IDF is the most moral army in the world. I repeat is the most moral army in the world [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2639.92s)]
*  Well, that brings me shooting. Okay, one second one more sentence. Mr [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2645.88s)]
*  Morgan, okay is not shooting a population is not shooting an innocent population [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2649.4s)]
*  But you tell me what do we need to do when when Hamas terrorists are hiding behind? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2654.0400000000004s)]
*  Human people are hiding behind school. You know the first thing you can do of hospitals [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2660.4s)]
*  What do we need to do? You know the first thing you could do you could lift the ban? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2665.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the Israeli government has put on international journalists going into Gaza [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2669.52s)]
*  So that all the claims that you make which always blame Hamas for absolutely everything [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2674.2799999999997s)]
*  Could be verified by independent journalists. Why don't you do that? Why for 20 months have you banned? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2679.64s)]
*  International media from going into Gaza an unprecedented ban for any modern warfare. Why why have you done this? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2686.56s)]
*  Well, I want to tell you that first of all [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2695.0s)]
*  You have to understand something that the IDF army is not trained to shoot in bursts [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2698.6s)]
*  They're trained to shoot through sights in a single shot mode [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2704.72s)]
*  That means they are not shooting like in the movies like you think what's that gonna do with the media? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2708.64s)]
*  So we can I will tell you I will tell you right now [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2713.2s)]
*  So if you'll just let me finish [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2716.72s)]
*  So you would agree with me that if the IDF would have shot in birth [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2719.08s)]
*  The Gaza would have been a parking lot within 12 hours and and and that [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2723.48s)]
*  Dangerous to the to the not is no, it's not you've destroyed 70% of Gaza already [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2729.2400000000002s)]
*  The Gazans is a parking lot with all due respect minister you have reduced two-thirds of Gaza to a parking lot [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2736.96s)]
*  Why are you are you pretending? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2744.28s)]
*  No, I'm not pretending I don't think that's funny. I'm saying the reality like it is [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2747.6s)]
*  No, that's funny, of course, it's funny. It's funny when you think that I'm pretending I'm sitting here in front of you [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2751.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't have to write I can live my life and dot and don't conduct with you [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2757.6000000000004s)]
*  But I am sitting here because I know I'm telling the truth [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2761.52s)]
*  I have no reason to lie now regarding to the journalist the IDF has declared [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2764.2000000000003s)]
*  the the Gaza Strip as a very dangerous combat zone and and there is a risk not just for for the journalist to be harmed [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2768.52s)]
*  By the terrorist or by the IDF trying to eliminate the terrorists that are hiding behind civilians [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2776.76s)]
*  But also there is a risk for journalists to be kidnapped [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2782.88s)]
*  But I have to ask mr. Morgan you are so worried about journalists that will eventually go into Gaza [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2786.12s)]
*  Don't worry about that [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2790.92s)]
*  But what about worrying a little bit that maybe that the Red Cross would go in to visit our hostage [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2791.88s)]
*  That are drinking sewage water that are sitting in cages of one meter that are being abused to be clear again [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2798.22s)]
*  Bitten up that haven't been even make it a word knows what is going on [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2804.64s)]
*  I'm gonna work like the Red Cross that is coming into our [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2808.8799999999997s)]
*  Visiting murderers. Okay, our murderers. I'm visiting them if I may respond I [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2813.48s)]
*  Agree, the hostages should be released. It is disgusting. They were taken in the first place. It remains disgusting [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2819.56s)]
*  It is horrific that Hamas holds the families of these hostages through this unbelievably [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2826.16s)]
*  Unbearable 20 months of hell. I hope that clarifies my position of hostages [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2832.32s)]
*  But you talk about the idea of being the most moral army in the world on Friday the Israeli publication [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2836.48s)]
*  Harass published a story claiming the IDF are deliberately firing at Palestinians at aid distribution centers [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2842.96s)]
*  Soldiers from the IDF told the publication the commander's ordered troops to shoot at crowds to drive them away or disperse them [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2849.96s)]
*  Even though it was clear they pose no threat more than 400 maybe [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2857.0s)]
*  500 people have been killed apparently in this manner Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2861.1200000000003s)]
*  Of course immediately said all of this was malicious faltered designed to defame the military and the Israeli military has launched an investigation [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2865.7200000000003s)]
*  Into possible war crimes following the report and you see this is the problem [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2874.0400000000004s)]
*  This is why the the fact there's no media there is so important [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2878.96s)]
*  It's not down to the IDF to decide whether journalists at risk is down to the journalists and their [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2882.32s)]
*  Organizations and if the journalists were there they could verify exactly who is shooting who in the food lines [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2887.76s)]
*  Because you just say as you always do everything is being done every bad act in Gaza is being done by [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2894.0s)]
*  Hamas and everybody else says no actually the IDF are doing a lot of bad things, too [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2901.76s)]
*  But the only way to really get to the bottom of this is let the journalists [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2907.6400000000003s)]
*  Pretty much everybody else pretty much everybody [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2912.2000000000003s)]
*  The only journalists allowed to operate of whom you've killed nearly 200 the Palestinian journalists [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2915.64s)]
*  They of course are the only journalists that can actually get any reports out because they're the only ones allowed in because they're already there [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2921.56s)]
*  You have the United Nations you have allies like the UK like France [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2928.4s)]
*  You've got America now who wants to bring this to an end pretty much everybody around you and here's the irony for this [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2934.4s)]
*  When when Israel attacked Iran I thought that was a justified thing to do [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2940.82s)]
*  To neutralize Iran's nuclear capability. I was I was glad that Israel finally did that action [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2944.48s)]
*  I was glad that Donald Trump joined in and specifically targeted the nuclear [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2951.46s)]
*  Capacity that Iran has I think it would have been a disaster for the world if they were allowed to develop nuclear weapons [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2957.76s)]
*  But the way you went about taking on Iran the way you went about taking on Hezbollah [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2963.52s)]
*  There's no relation to what you've done in Gaza [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2968.44s)]
*  You're just obliterating Gaza and you don't really care how many civilians are dying in the process you say you do [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2970.72s)]
*  But you don't really [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2976.7599999999998s)]
*  Just the fact that you listen mr [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2979.3599999999997s)]
*  Morgan because you if you repeat something again and again and again [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2981.3599999999997s)]
*  You won't make it true that we don't want to kill innocent civilians in Gaza period [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2984.3199999999997s)]
*  But I'm telling you again and again that once they hide under human population and we have to eliminate [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2989.7599999999998s)]
*  Terrorists we have to do what we have to do now [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2997.04s)]
*  I don't remember you asking the allies that you were talking about in in World War two [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=2999.06s)]
*  If if they were hiding about how many Nazi how many children died when when we eliminated the Nazis? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3005.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't remember that I you know what I don't remember in any mid-war where you count numbers, but you obviously [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3012.68s)]
*  Emphasize on that on what's going on in Gaza now the difference one [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3019.4s)]
*  Gaza [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3024.32s)]
*  You ask such a long question you can't let me answer [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3026.56s)]
*  How many amass the difference the difference I will answer let me finish [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3029.44s)]
*  when the difference between Iran and Hezbollah is the fact is that a [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3033.52s)]
*  Gaza is the most crowded population that we need to deal with and and two million people in the Gaza Strip that are so [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3039.44s)]
*  So crowded and the terrorists are hiding in between you know I can tell you mr. Morgan [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3046.48s)]
*  Massive [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3052.44s)]
*  I don't think we will eliminate every Hamas person because we didn't eliminate [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3055.0400000000004s)]
*  How many amounts have you killed? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3061.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not gonna go into specifics with you. I'm gonna tell you [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3064.28s)]

*  To hear all the numbers. You don't know how many you've killed. How do you know how many you have to be killed? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3074.52s)]

*  Okay, but I can tell you I can assure you that the IDF is trying to avoid as much as many [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3133.8399999999997s)]
*  To not let me finish mr. Morgan. Yeah, let me finish one sentence [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3147.2799999999997s)]
*  I can tell you that the IDF every time it needs to eliminate a terrorist [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3151.06s)]
*  It tells the population to go to this humanitarian corridor or to this humanitarian corridor [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3155.48s)]
*  They alert them in advance unlike the terrorists who shoot at us and don't and should it and an innocent population [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3160.52s)]
*  Murder children and women and elderly and men and and everything in their power [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3167.36s)]

*  What on earth did they did to them? So eventually I just want to tell you that [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3178.2400000000002s)]
*  The IDF has no no [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3183.08s)]
*  willing whatsoever to shoot at an innocent population when they want in actual fact to save the Gazans from the real [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3185.9599999999996s)]
*  Occupations of the Hamas terrorism who abuses them and I wonder if you see those videos that the Hamas people are [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3193.52s)]
*  That I'm sorry that the Gazans are freeing in the in the what's happening in the social medias when they're saying Hamas [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3200.12s)]
*  Won't let us out Hamas won't let us take the the humanitarian aid Hamas is killing us if we're just [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3207.06s)]
*  Daring to talk and if you think that Hamas is a legitimate [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3213.58s)]
*  Ruling then I don't know what to say [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3217.54s)]
*  But if you don't and I think you don't I think you don't then you should be thanking us like the rest of the world for [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3219.04s)]

*  I started this interview by saying Hamas should not obviously be in charge anymore [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3228.42s)]
*  But I also think the IDF should stop what they're doing in Gaza now because too many innocent people are being killed and I'm afraid [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3232.42s)]
*  I don't believe what the IDF or the Israeli government is now saying about what's happening in Gaza because you won't let the media in [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3239.1800000000003s)]
*  To verify it and in my experience is a long history of being a journalist when people stop journalists going into an area [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3245.86s)]
*  Like Gaza during a war it's because they don't want people to see what they're doing there. They've got something to hide anyway [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3251.86s)]
*  I've got to leave it there [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3257.1000000000004s)]

*  I've been on your show and then the past year and a half you've asked me do I condemn the violence did my Hamas? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3360.46s)]
*  What did I say Pierce? Yes, I do because I'm against violent extremism whether it's a terrorist group or whether it's state-sanctioned terrorism [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3365.22s)]
*  But what we've seen in the past year and a half, especially that report three days ago [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3371.54s)]
*  Is the IDF has been commanded to shoot at unarmed civilians Palestinians who are at a food distribution site [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3374.9s)]
*  Pierce any person with any morality any decency who believes in God like I do [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3384.02s)]
*  How can they support the idea of shooting? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3389.62s)]
*  Palestinian civilians who are trying to get humanitarian aid, you know, how many Palestinians have been killed in the quote-unquote killing field? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3393.62s)]
*  That's an idea of soldiers were not mine [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3399.92s)]
*  570 Palestinians unarmed trying to get food [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3403.36s)]
*  Why is that food there through humanitarian aid because Israel like you mentioned has done a blockade [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3406.56s)]
*  Because Israel occupies Gaza the occupation is immoral the settlements are immoral. We haven't even talked about the West Bank Pierce [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3412.48s)]
*  I know you've been there. I've been there the terrorism that has been unleashed [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3420.52s)]
*  I think the expansion of settlements on the West Bank is absolutely appalling. It's disgusting [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3423.52s)]
*  It's illegal it shouldn't be happening Colonel Kevin, let me bring you in here you've been over there [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3429.02s)]
*  You know, you're very supportive of Israel's government and the IDF and what they're doing [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3434.74s)]
*  But surely with all your military experience even you must be looking at what's happening now in Gaza and thinking this has got to come to an end [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3439.88s)]
*  I [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3447.58s)]
*  Think everyone's thinking it's got to come to an end. Certainly the Israelis are thinking it's got to come to an end [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3448.82s)]
*  they've been fighting a [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3454.02s)]
*  Vicious brutal terrorist organization for 20 months that is embedded completely in the civilian population [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3456.34s)]
*  They've been doing their very best and I've witnessed it myself inside Gaza with the IDF [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3463.66s)]
*  They've been doing their very best to minimize the deaths of innocent civilians [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3468.66s)]
*  And I think they've succeeded to a large extent in that [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3472.94s)]
*  I don't know what the latest figure is from Hamas, but it's something around 50 60 thousand or thereabouts [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3476.54s)]
*  That's their estimate and of course we can't rely on that in any way [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3482.58s)]
*  But we've got nothing else to go to go on the IDF don't issue estimates of their civilians that they think they might have killed [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3486.14s)]
*  But they have issued estimates of the number of Hamas terrorists that they think they've killed [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3493.46s)]
*  Obviously not exact and it's something around about 25 to 30. Why don't they count the civilians? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3497.88s)]
*  How do you do that? I mean, how do they count the terrorists? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3504.62s)]
*  Because they're targeting the terrorists they know who they're targeting and they believe they know when they believe they've killed them you can't you can't count every [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3508.02s)]
*  single person that's [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3514.82s)]
*  Coming under attack and the reality is that? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3516.3s)]
*  If those figures are correct and let's assume for a moment they are [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3520.1800000000003s)]
*  Particularly, I don't trust the Hamas figures, but let's assume they're correct [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3524.7400000000002s)]
*  That means that it's approximately one civilian killed for every competent killed inside Gaza in the last 20 months [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3528.1800000000003s)]
*  Which is terrible. It's a really terrible statistic [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3535.86s)]
*  But if you compare it to Afghanistan the Americans and their allies estimate they killed about five civilians for every competent in [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3538.58s)]
*  Afghanistan and three in Iraq and the United Nations estimate that in combat in urban combat since the Second World War [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3546.34s)]
*  About nine civilians have died for every competent [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3553.58s)]
*  So it shows you know [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3557.06s)]
*  This is not this is not easy [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3558.42s)]
*  Hamas is doing their level best to make Israel kill as many of their own civilians as possible to achieve exactly what they have achieved [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3559.7s)]
*  Which is a vilification [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3566.8199999999997s)]
*  My argument would be back to you. Is it Israel is not achieving its goals. It's not got rid of her mass. That's clear [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3568.58s)]
*  It's not got the hostages released. They've only been released during diplomatic phases of this 20-month war [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3575.9s)]
*  They're now talking openly through people like Smodrich to finance Minister of [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3582.46s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing the entire Gaza Strip of all Palestinians, which is a war crime if they try and do that [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3587.26s)]
*  They try and kick them all out [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3593.46s)]
*  So none of the goals which they set out to achieve have been achieved and don't look like anything near being achieved [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3595.34s)]
*  And at the same time you've got 70% of Gaza has been destroyed [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3602.1400000000003s)]
*  You've got this moving population being moved around and wherever they move to they then get bombed again [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3605.7400000000002s)]
*  You've got thousands of them queuing up desperately for food despite [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3612.2599999999998s)]
*  Israelis claiming no one there's hungry [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3616.7s)]
*  Well, what are they stampeding each other for to get fragments of food if that's not the case [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3619.06s)]
*  And then he got this her acts report [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3623.46s)]
*  Which of course Netanyahu is emphatically denied and the harass report coming from IDF soldiers [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3625.18s)]
*  They they source saying that a lot of the people dying in these shooting incidents in the food lines are being shot dead by [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3630.9s)]
*  Israelis so you pulling people if this is true and it's an Israeli publication and this is true [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3638.5s)]
*  Well, you can you can laugh Colonel Ken, but why would you laugh? I laugh because it's [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3644.6200000000003s)]
*  The her acts report [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3652.46s)]
*  As far as I can see deliberately distorted what was they were told in the Hebrew version [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3654.6600000000003s)]
*  the soldiers apparently said we were told to shoot in the direction of [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3659.86s)]
*  Her mass of civilians who were rising that's not true. No that I've read that I've read that it's simply not true [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3665.66s)]
*  That's a conspiracy theory. Honestly, it is a conspiracy theory because they talked about the killing fields [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3673.14s)]
*  They talked about lots of people dying [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3680.18s)]
*  People dying I [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3683.46s)]
*  Read the article and I don't believe it's true. I've been as I said before I've been inside Gaza with the idea before [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3685.06s)]
*  I've seen the extraordinary measures they take to minimize even the report you gave panel can't even the report you did had [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3691.46s)]
*  Gunfire in the background at the end. Let's take a look [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3698.8199999999997s)]
*  Many of the people behind me here have told me it's the first time they've ever received free aid [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3702.66s)]
*  So don't believe the propaganda that's been churned out by her mass and amplified by too much of an international and national media [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3708.8599999999997s)]
*  I [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3716.64s)]
*  Was almost like a comedy sketch if it wasn't so serious there you are [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3719.96s)]
*  You don't believe any of the stories of the Israeli shooting at people here and next thing here is a machine going going off [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3724.2s)]
*  Yeah, you may you may find machine guns funny, but I don't know the rest of us [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3730.24s)]
*  Who are funny but it flew in the face of what you literally was saying on camera [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3734.0s)]
*  You said it was a comedy sketch that machine gun. I said it would be funny if it had been a comedy sketch [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3738.8799999999997s)]
*  But it was serious. I was in that base in that [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3744.2s)]
*  Distribution aid distribution site for around about two to three hours in that time [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3749.04s)]
*  I heard a huge number of explosions gunfire [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3753.0s)]
*  Etc etc etc because this is in a war zone and you get machine gunfire you get explosions in war zone [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3756.08s)]
*  That machine gunfire if you looked at that video clip carefully [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3762.2s)]
*  You would see that not one single [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3765.3399999999997s)]
*  Garzen flinched when that fire was heard because it was nowhere near the aid distribution site [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3767.24s)]
*  It was distant fire constantly going on but you could you know, you can try and turn that into [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3772.5s)]
*  The idea that it's the IDF as many people have on social media tried to say this is the idea of shooting [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3778.22s)]
*  Civilians, why would the IDF want to shoot at civilians as a humanitarian aid site that they support [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3783.86s)]
*  That they help to set up and that they want to work. They wouldn't it would make no sense [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3790.26s)]
*  Whatsoever the people that are doing the shooting are Hamas [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3795.78s)]
*  I spoke to many garzens to bring is at least 50 in that [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3798.94s)]
*  Why don't the journalists get in then let the journalists in and that can be verified [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3802.46s)]
*  They have told me why don't I let the journalists got nothing to do with me [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3806.92s)]
*  Why doesn't Israel let the journalists in then? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3810.2200000000003s)]
*  The shameful this is shameful. You'll have to ask Israel that I would we all know why they're not letting them internal chemist [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3812.66s)]
*  They don't want the world to see what's happening. Let me bring in [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3818.66s)]
*  Let me bring in Shabos. He's been waiting patiently show us the first reason the first you've asked me a question [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3822.46s)]
*  The first reason is because there's a very big danger if journalists went in on their own of getting kidnapped that okay you say [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3827.6s)]
*  That's the risk that they should be prepared to take themselves [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3835.76s)]
*  You say that but then Western journalists kidnapped inside girls [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3839.4s)]
*  I'm convenient. So that's why you have a 20-month media bank. Come on [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3843.1600000000003s)]
*  And the second reason I don't know this for sure [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3847.96s)]
*  I'm surmising but the second reason if I was in that position [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3851.28s)]
*  I would be very hesitant to let journalists in because I've seen how many journalists [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3854.68s)]
*  Distort what they see from the West from Britain from the United States [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3859.3999999999996s)]
*  Tell the story how very convenient [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3868.7599999999998s)]
*  We haven't got as long as we would normally have because we ran over with the minister but Shabos [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3873.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean your response to this I would start by saying this Pierce, you know how many Jews are living in Gaza [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3878.52s)]
*  It's zero, you know how many Jews are living in Ramallah. It's zero [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3882.74s)]
*  You know how many Jews are living in Nablus at zero [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3885.1s)]
*  You know how many Jews are living in Jenin it's zero after Egypt and half a dozen other Arab Muslim countries attacked Israel in 1967 [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3886.7799999999997s)]
*  Israel was able to conquer an area called the Sinai Peninsula. That is two times as large as Israel and in 1979 [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3893.2999999999997s)]
*  They gave it back to Egypt unilaterally and unconditionally in 2005 Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3899.3399999999997s)]
*  They expelled every last living and dead Jew from Gaza all in the name of peace [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3906.3799999999997s)]
*  The argument that Israel is is experiencing or is trying to have an expansionist greater state of Israel is not corroborated by the facts [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3910.54s)]
*  Or reality and all I can say is thank God that there was no Piers Morgan uncensored during World War two [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3918.54s)]
*  Because what you would do during the bombing of Dresden during the Battle of Berlin is you would have German commentators talking about the civilian [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3924.1s)]
*  Death toll and how terrible it is that the out why was the Geneva Convention set up? [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3930.86s)]
*  The Geneva Convention was set up specifically in order to derive the world of having Nazism and fascism in the future actually was designed [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3935.46s)]
*  specifically [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3942.46s)]
*  Specifically to avoid some of the things that we saw in World War two. That was why I was set up [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3944.2999999999997s)]
*  Correct and the Geneva Convention made it clear that unfortunately war in the 20th and 21st century is a necessary evil [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3950.74s)]
*  It is terrible to have civilians being killed. It is terrible when you have a civilian death toll [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3957.3399999999997s)]
*  But unfortunately that is a consequence of every war ever fought in modern warfare [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3962.34s)]
*  I mean, do you know how many German civilians were killed during World War two? It was two to three million [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3966.82s)]
*  You know how many Austro-Hungarians were killed during World War one? It was anywhere from five hundred thousand to one million [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3970.6200000000003s)]
*  But if we judge the we're not in a world war [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3975.34s)]
*  we're in a war between the most powerful military in the Middle East and a [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3977.78s)]
*  Two million strong with half of those being under 18 [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3982.5s)]
*  Population of the Gaza Strip, which has been under occupation now for decades [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3986.3s)]
*  That's what we're talking about sort of world war. We're not talking about a world war [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3991.1s)]
*  We're talking about the most sophisticated military in the Middle East [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3995.62s)]
*  Relentlessly bombarding for 20 months a small area of land the Gaza Strip with with a million people under 18 [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=3999.38s)]
*  That's what we're talking about. No, I agree Hamas had to be got rid of but it hasn't happened [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4007.46s)]
*  And at some point there has to be an acknowledgement that this mission has failed and all that's happened is Gaza has been flat [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4013.94s)]
*  More and more innocent people are being killed [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4021.5s)]
*  None of the mission goals are being achieved and now we've got members of the government [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4024.02s)]
*  Openly saying actually what we want to do is kick all the Palestinians out [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4029.2599999999998s)]
*  Openly saying it so this mission has changed from self-defense to actually ethnic cleansing. That's my problem with it [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4033.74s)]
*  The idea is a democratic politicians who are not controlling the war you have you heard the Prime Minister [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4041.7799999999997s)]
*  Members of the war cabinet have you heard them talking about ethnic cleansing the garden population people [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4048.7400000000002s)]
*  Is equivalent of the chance of the check of a goodness sake [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4056.58s)]
*  It's not involved come on Colonel Kemp take your blinkers off man [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4061.26s)]
*  Involved in anything that's happening [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4067.34s)]
*  Your military career but what a ridiculous statement [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4073.34s)]
*  Made is that the [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4078.42s)]
*  Israel is not achieving subjective. It is achieving its objectives. It's taken a very long time. It's been terrible [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4080.58s)]
*  It's taken a long time. It's a very complex war. It's very difficult [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4086.06s)]
*  They've destroyed huge elements of Hamas [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4089.34s)]
*  I said before maybe around 25 to 30 thousand of them [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4091.7400000000002s)]
*  Which is not far off the number they started with and also they are having hostage release [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4095.46s)]
*  You said they've been released only through Japanese diplomatic means. How did those diplomatic means come about through military pressure? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4100.06s)]
*  That's how it happens [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4106.62s)]
*  Final quote what we're doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4111.02s)]
*  Indiscriminate limitless cruel and criminal killing of civilians [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4115.26s)]
*  We're not doing this through the loss of control in any specific sector not due to some disproportionate outburst by some soldiers in one unit [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4118.42s)]
*  Rather it's the result of government policy knowingly [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4125.34s)]
*  evilly [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4129.780000000001s)]
*  maliciously [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4130.9400000000005s)]
*  irresponsibly dictated yes [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4132.42s)]
*  Israel is committing war crimes and that's a quote from former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4134.42s)]
*  Yeah, and I agree it is true and I interviewed him and he's heard that to me. He's wrong. All right [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4140.9800000000005s)]
*  I've got to leave it. I'm sorry. We didn't have more time for the debate [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4145.54s)]
*  We ran late with the minister who was running late herself, but I appreciate you for your patience and for the debate that we were able [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV6N9TE_foU&t=4147.62s)]
