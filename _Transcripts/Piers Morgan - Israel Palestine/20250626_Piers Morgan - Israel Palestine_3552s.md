Video Description: US-based Iranian-British activist and attorney Elica Lebon said she’d only come on Piers Morgan Uncensored to discuss the ongoing conflict in the Middle East if it was alongside a certain one of our regular contributors.
“It has to be Dave Smith,” she messaged the Uncensored team. “The man has so much influence and he is so wrong on every level… the world needs to understand why every one of his points is garbage.”
 
So, today the pair face off in a fascinating discussion on an imperative subject. But first Piers Morgan speaks to professor of World Politics at Tehran University, Dr Foad Izadi, who shockingly says he’s PROUD of what Hamas did on October 7.

# “It Ain’t Gonna Be YOU, Lady!” Dave Smith REFUSES To Be ‘Smacked Down’ By Elica Lebon on Iran-Israel
**Piers Morgan - Israel Palestine:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk)
*  You wanted to debate me because I'm so wrong about everything and I'm so influential and you wanted to smack it down [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=0.0s)]
*  It ain't gonna be you lady. What you're talking about here is a regime whose fundamental [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=5.84s)]
*  Motto is death to israel and death to the united states [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=11.68s)]
*  Everybody is fully fully aware that the regime has always been months away from developing nuclear weapons [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=15.36s)]
*  Just total bullshit [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=22.48s)]
*  I do not think it's a legitimate justification for them to launch a war because they claim someone else is making nukes when they're not [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=23.6s)]
*  Should donald trump get the nobel peace prize? Well, I guess grading on the obama curve [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=29.36s)]
*  Everybody deserves a nobel peace prize if you're so against what israel is doing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=34.16s)]
*  Why are you so happy to fund this regime in its domestic and regional terror? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=38.32s)]
*  It's almost like it's almost like I'm opposing war across the board [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Hmm, you are the most demoralized brain-rotted idiot alive [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Just a moment. We'll have an exceptional debate on the iran crisis with two uncensored [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Favorite guests, uh, dave smith and alika lebon. We'll begin with a view from teran [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=57.84s)]
*  Dr fauad izadi is a professor of world politics at teran university an influential pro iranian regime commentator [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=62.64s)]
*  Mr. Izadi, thank you very much indeed for joining me [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=71.12s)]
*  Thank you for having me. I'm poor iran. I'm pro iranian regime. I understand. Um, first of all [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Just if you may paint a picture for what life at the moment is like in terran [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  What is the the mood of the people there? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=85.6s)]
*  Uh, it's becoming normal gradually [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=89.28s)]
*  Um, this was a surprise attack [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=93.44s)]
*  People were thinking that if there is a military confrontation it would come [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=96.96s)]
*  if [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=102.24s)]
*  negotiations failed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  uh the negotiations were scheduled [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=104.8s)]
*  on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=108.63999999999999s)]
*  Friday [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=110.56s)]
*  And the attacks came two days before the next round of negotiations [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=111.76s)]
*  So everybody was surprised [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=116.8s)]
*  some people left [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=119.28s)]
*  major cities [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Some people estate in the last couple of days since the ceasefire [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=122.56s)]
*  People are gradually coming back. We have had more than 600 several million casualties mostly women and children [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=127.68s)]
*  So they are going to be funerals [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=135.04s)]
*  Uh people didn't do funerals during attacks, but I think the city is getting back to its normal [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=137.12s)]
*  uh way and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  People who have been lost are going to be remembered by their family members [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=147.44s)]
*  People are stunned that this is seemingly all over [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  after just 12 days [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=155.44s)]
*  and that iran is prepared to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  Maintain the ceasefire given what was obviously a very humiliating 12 days [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  For the regime first with israel attacking and controlling the skies above terran seemingly with impunity [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=167.04s)]
*  And then of course the united states launching the bunker buster bombs on three nuclear sites [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=174.0s)]
*  Again with apparent ease, you know people felt from the rhetoric coming out of the regime leadership [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=180.56s)]
*  That the retaliation would be significantly more prolonged [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  and more [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=191.6s)]
*  Uh in scale than we've seen why is the regime prepared to? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=193.04s)]
*  Honor a ceasefire so quickly and do you think it will hold? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=198.32s)]
*  I think one reason is because of the surprise that nobody was expecting this attack [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  When the government is surprised when the government and the nation is attacked in this manner [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  It would take time for them to go back to normal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=215.92s)]
*  So if there is a ceasefire offer and it came from the united states [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=218.64s)]
*  Israelis asked for it because of the hits that were getting from iran iran accepted [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=222.55999999999997s)]
*  But I don't think anyone in iran is has this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Line of thinking that israelis will follow through with the ceasefire. I think people expect israelis to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  Do to iran what they are doing to lebanon? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  Attack they attack lebanon [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  Anytime they want [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=245.36s)]
*  Uh, and I think that they are going to do the same thing with iran [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=246.56s)]
*  So iranian government is going to take [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Some measures to make sure that the government and the people are not surprised again [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  What would those measures look like because there's lots of conjecture [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  About how damaged? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  iran's nuclear program has been [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=265.2s)]
*  by these strikes, um [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=268.48s)]
*  Do you have any information? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=270.72s)]
*  About that because it's certainly from the iranian side there they're making noises that there was significant damage u.s intelligence [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=272.72s)]
*  slightly less so [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=279.6s)]
*  I don't think the iranian government is going to make that knowledge public because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=282.48s)]
*  If they say it wasn't damaged that would give israelis and americans reasons to attack iran again illegally [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  And if they say it is damaged it is it is not damaged [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=297.12s)]
*  If they say it's damaged then [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  This is not going to be good for a country that needs deterrence [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=305.68s)]
*  so I think one of the ideas that iranian government had was to keep its [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=311.44s)]
*  nuclear program going [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=317.44s)]
*  So the other side would realize that iran is not defenseless [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=320.16s)]
*  So I think this is going to be kept secret [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=324.0s)]
*  And the other side can use the mechanism that they have to find out what the realities [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=327.12s)]
*  You I understand do not believe that iran [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=333.44s)]
*  Was engaged in a nuclear program in the way that's been reported [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=337.52s)]
*  So just explain that to me because certainly from the last [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  uh atomic agency report independent body obviously [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=345.36s)]
*  They said that there had been [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=349.52s)]
*  Uh a rapid increase in the enrichment of uranium by the iranian regime from about three and a half percent to 60 [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=351.36s)]
*  Which as you know is about 30 shy of weaponizing into a nuclear bomb [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  And that is the pretext on which israel attacks and then america [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=367.12s)]
*  Attacks and obviously many people have views that israel have planned this for a long time that may well be the case [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=371.04s)]
*  But they certainly used this report [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  As evidence of a rapid expansion [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=379.12s)]
*  Of the enrichment of uranium with bigger stocks enriched to higher levels way higher than would be needed for civilian usage [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=382.24s)]
*  What is it that you don't agree with about that? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=390.56s)]
*  uh [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=394.16s)]
*  You know that report came out [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=395.2s)]
*  and the way it's supposed to work is that the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=398.08s)]
*  International atomic energy agency would refer that report to the un security [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=401.12s)]
*  council and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=406.46s)]
*  If they want to pass a resolution [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=408.56s)]
*  On that they can pass a resolution [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=411.68s)]
*  Put iran under article 42 of chapter 7 of the un charter, then you can attack iran [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=414.32s)]
*  Just because iea published the report doesn't give anyone any permission to attack iran. So that's point number one [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=421.52s)]
*  The second point is that the u.s intelligence community? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=429.44s)]
*  Uh had this [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=433.32s)]
*  Report on iran's nuclear program in march and it had three points [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=435.8s)]
*  It gave three points of what iran's nuclear program. The first point was that iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=441.32s)]
*  The second point was that iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon program and the third point [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=447.0s)]
*  Was that the iranian leaders have not decided to have a nuclear weapon program? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=452.36s)]
*  Tulsi gabbert the head of the u.s intelligence community took that report went to the u.s senate [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=456.94s)]
*  Intelligence committee presented that report the video is available online. I put it on twitter and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=464.3s)]
*  That was the conclusion of the u.s intelligence community the director of the international atomic energy agency [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=471.82s)]
*  Rafael grossi had been doing a lot of interviews in the last few days [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=479.34s)]
*  Saying the same thing saying that with all the inspections that i.e. Had they never found [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=483.92s)]
*  Any nuclear weapon program in iran? They they said that iran is enriching [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=490.64s)]
*  At 60 percent, but that doesn't mean that you have a nuclear weapon program [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=495.76s)]
*  They did also just to jump in there. They they did also say [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=499.68s)]
*  That the iranian regime had gone out of its way [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=503.28s)]
*  To hide information and was not being fully cooperative in inspections and so on [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=507.12s)]
*  Again, if you're israel or the united states you have a situation of everyone agreeing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=513.54s)]
*  The iranians been enriched to a very high level [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=519.9399999999999s)]
*  With no real explanation as to why other than it appeared to be on the progression path to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=523.4599999999999s)]

*  Fight back. This is very normal [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=846.34s)]

*  And i've been very critical recently of what the israeli government has been doing in gaza [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=853.32s)]
*  In the last few months, I think it's crossed any line of of self-defense. However, the idea that you are prepared to say on [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  Camera that you are proud of what hamas did in october the 7th is frankly disgusting [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. It's disgusting for the british government to be supplying the genocidal regime with weapons. That is disgusting [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=872.36s)]
*  Okay, we'll leave it there professor azadi, thank you for joining me. Thank you [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=880.94s)]
*  Well, we'll return now to the vex debate about u.s [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=886.7800000000001s)]
*  Involvement israeli influence and the moral case for war on tiram. She and a lot of dave smith and i'm sensitive recently [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=889.4200000000001s)]
*  Not there's anything wrong with that. Dave's always welcome here. He's back for another debate today because his co-panelist [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=894.22s)]
*  While discussing debate ideas with our producers said these words [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=899.1800000000001s)]
*  It has to be dave smith the man has so much influence and he's so wrong on every level [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=902.5400000000001s)]
*  The world needs to understand why every one of his points is garbage [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=908.24s)]
*  So I may as well take the next hour off [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=912.32s)]
*  But joining me for what I think will be a fascinating discussion on an imperative subject elika leban the iranian american attorney [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=914.64s)]
*  And activist and dave smith libertarian commentator and the host of part of the problem [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=920.88s)]
*  Um, let me just start before we go any further [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=925.84s)]
*  Elika just with a response to my interview there with professor izadi in tiram, which was actually reasonably [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=928.72s)]
*  You know civilized normal until the end when he brazenly said he was proud of what hamas did in october the 7th [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=937.14s)]
*  And at that point I realized he was a complete lunatic. But what did you feel listening to it? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=945.86s)]
*  I'm glad the world's finally realizing what we've been knowing for the past 46 years [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=953.22s)]
*  But ultimately, you know, you just have to look at their talking points and realize the ridiculous hypocrisy of it [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=957.62s)]
*  Wasn't his whole thing that palestinians have been oppressed and therefore it is their moral obligation and everyone's moral obligation to attack israel [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  Well by that same logic what they're doing to iranian people [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=970.76s)]
*  Lynching them torturing them blinding them then by that logic the entire world should be bombing iran right now [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=975.0s)]
*  So how can you speak out of both sides of your mouth saying that this type of oppression [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=981.16s)]
*  Justifies not just military intervention but terrorism [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=985.72s)]
*  But you don't think anything should happen to you while you're doing this to your own people [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=989.6600000000001s)]
*  And that's how you know, it's a bluff. That's how you know, it was never about palestinian people. It was never about oppression [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  These are not people who care about oppression. These are the enforcers of oppression who weaponize [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=999.1800000000001s)]
*  Oppression in order to gain legitimacy in their attacks on israel [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1005.4200000000001s)]
*  Dave we're going to come to the main debate in a few moments [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1009.6600000000001s)]
*  but just your reaction to that interview with professor izadi because like I say it was like a [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1012.86s)]
*  Game of two halves, right where for most of it he seemed perfectly reasonable really albeit [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1018.24s)]
*  It wouldn't be arguments. I would put forward or agree with but I could understand where he was coming from and he seemed quite [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  Reasonable and then right at the end [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1028.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean for somebody just to on camera say they were proud of what hamas did on october the 7th [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1031.2s)]
*  What was your reaction to that? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1036.32s)]
*  Uh very similar to yours. I thought there were a lot of reasonable things said up until that point [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1038.56s)]
*  But of course, I think this isn't that uncommon [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1043.46s)]
*  regimes and supporters of regimes are often guilty of just the most outrageous hypocrisy and you think of historical examples like [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1046.18s)]
*  Joseph stalin used to put out propaganda about how horribly racist america was and how uh, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1054.5s)]
*  How jim crowe was terrible and they treated the black people so terrible in the united states of america, which like it was true [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1060.82s)]
*  but [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1068.5800000000002s)]
*  What a hypocrite for joseph stalin to be pretending like he was concerned with human rights as he you know [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1069.48s)]
*  Oversaw the gulags and stuff like that. And so I think listen the claim that uh hamas and hesbala [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1075.0s)]
*  Have never engaged in terrorism is just ridiculous and and stupid and you know [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1081.72s)]
*  But then again, I would say I also think the claim that the idf has never engaged in terrorism is kind of equally ridiculous [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1086.92s)]
*  And so, you know it is in in a sense the hypocrisy of all of the regimes [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1093.72s)]
*  Allows somebody like that to point out your hypocrisy to say to say, oh, yeah pierce [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1098.54s)]
*  Well, you're criticizing around saying that they're a state sponsor of terrorism as a citizen of a government that is sponsoring [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1103.8999999999999s)]
*  israel's destruction of gaza and um, you know, so again, there's there's awful all of this is just horrible [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1110.78s)]
*  Um, and there's awful hypocrisy all around. I you know, I think there were some fair points that he made in there [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1117.34s)]
*  But yeah, I mean listen october 7th [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1122.96s)]
*  And even if you want to go with the um the idea that there was friendly fire or even some type of like Hannibal [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1124.88s)]
*  Directive issued there's there's been people who have done deep dives into this and there is some evidence that some people died that way [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1130.88s)]
*  But there's just no question that hamas crossed the border and killed a lot of innocent people [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1137.52s)]
*  And as i've been saying to you since i've been on your show pierce, I just think it's [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1141.76s)]
*  Um, it's horrible when people downplay that and it does nothing but undercut their [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1145.76s)]
*  I agree. I mean if all you do is focus purely on the gopro footage that hamas broadcasted the world [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1150.34s)]
*  If that's all you do you see exactly the horror that they perpetrated. Um, all right elika [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1158.18s)]
*  You wanted to come on but but specifically with dave smith. You think he's wrong about absolutely everything. So just [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1163.78s)]
*  outline your main [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1170.66s)]
*  Complaints about dave smith, you know, I don't have an outline [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1172.42s)]
*  But I think I can just go off of everything that he says, you know in this example [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1175.72s)]
*  You you correctly pointed out what the soviet union was doing [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1179.56s)]
*  You correctly pointed out that they would use these kernel of truths as part of their disinformation campaigns [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1183.24s)]
*  But the question is what were their disinformation campaigns rooted in? Well, we know what the entire, you know communist agenda was [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1188.68s)]
*  And that was demoralization of the west [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1195.56s)]
*  in order to sort of um gain this distraction internally within the west so that they would overthrow their own government so the whole point [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1198.52s)]
*  Of soviet disinformation and ideological subversion was to convince people that the west and israel [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1205.8s)]
*  Was the source of all evil in the world all of the kgb defectors have said the same thing uri bezmenov mokai mokai pacheppa [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1212.2s)]
*  But the way they talk about how this is achieved they talk about [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1219.64s)]
*  Demoralization and demoralization is the point where you can no longer tell [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1223.68s)]
*  Truth from fiction you can no longer tell right from wrong and what happens when you reach that stage you start making moral equivalencies [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1227.96s)]
*  Between liberal democracies and terrorists and or autocrats. So when you say that yes, yes [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1235.72s)]
*  I do see that the islamic republic are terrorists, but I don't see how other liberal democracies are not terrorists as well [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1241.72s)]
*  That is exactly the ideological subversion which you correctly identified, but don't see how it's a part of your own talking points [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1248.2s)]
*  dave [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1255.48s)]
*  No, that's I mean, that's just a talking point yourself there. I mean, it's just not true [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1257.24s)]
*  I know that the defenders of israel often like to use this term moral equivalency [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1262.38s)]
*  But it's just made up and doesn't apply to what i'm saying at all [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1266.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean if I were to say that I no way ever said that the society of iran is [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1269.98s)]
*  Identical to the society of israel or that the people the citizens of that country both enjoy the same amount of liberty [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1275.74s)]
*  I've never said there are massive differences. Listen, I would not I would say that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1282.94s)]
*  American society certainly within america was far superior to iraqi society under saddam hussein [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1287.84s)]
*  But you can say that and also say that george w bush launched an illegal war in iraq [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1294.8s)]
*  These things aren't contradictory at all. And so what i'm talking about is let me finish what i'm talking about here [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1300.0s)]
*  Is that the idf is committing acts of terrorism? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1305.6s)]
*  And so you can say it doesn't count when a government does it but there's no objective moral standard to that [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1309.52s)]
*  So i'm not making an equivalency between anything [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1314.98s)]
*  I'm just pointing out that these two groups both have committed terrorism [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1317.86s)]
*  And so in the same sense that you could point out how two people have both committed the same crime [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1322.5s)]
*  That is not the same as saying those two people are identical in every way [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1327.1399999999999s)]
*  so when you [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1331.3s)]
*  Yeah, so you you are drawing these moral equivalencies and you're doing exactly that you're saying i'm just saying [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1332.8999999999999s)]
*  How is the idf different to hamas? How is the idf different to the islamic public? I didn't say that [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1338.1s)]
*  No, you're making you're saying that there are I could list off right now. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1343.64s)]
*  Because you're starting with completely straw manning my position. So let's just before you just [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1348.3600000000001s)]
*  Before hold on hold on [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1352.6000000000001s)]
*  So before you argue with what you made up instead of arguing with i'm saying [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1353.64s)]
*  I could name a thousand differences between hamas and the idf [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying there's no difference between them [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1362.2s)]
*  Clarify what you're saying could be I don't think it could be any clearer. I'm saying they both commit horrific acts [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1365.16s)]
*  Both kill innocent people [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1371.9s)]
*  You have said now and you've said online on twitter when you were debating people [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1374.22s)]
*  You asked this exact question, which is exactly what a demoralized person would ask [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1378.54s)]
*  How is this different to that? How is israel doing this different to that now? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1383.3400000000001s)]
*  Let me just start by saying it's like a basic iq test [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1388.54s)]
*  I could say how is this act different from this act? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1392.38s)]
*  That's not saying how is this entity the exact identical to this other entity [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1395.5s)]
*  The point is that targeting innocent sure [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1400.1599999999999s)]
*  This this it's exactly like saying [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1404.8799999999999s)]
*  How is it different between a cop and a robber when they're both pointing guns at each other and they're both making each other feel threatened [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1408.08s)]
*  Isn't that the exact same thing? Yes, sure. It is the exact same act, but it is a different motivation [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1415.12s)]
*  Okay, that's what the difference is because when you have a regime like the islamic republic or hamas [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1421.36s)]
*  That's literal inception and existence is based on the destruction of israel and and death to america [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1427.22s)]
*  And basically just killing everybody who disagrees with their ideology and another [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1434.26s)]
*  Entity whose focus is on protecting its people. Yes, the actions may look the same [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1439.3s)]
*  And in fact the actions may be just as wrong as each other [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1444.74s)]
*  They may be just as brutal and terroristic as each other [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1448.42s)]
*  But the motivation is different and to be demoralized means to not understand that [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  Hang on a second. All right, let me jump in there because actually what difference does it make to the innocent civilians? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1456.52s)]
*  Who are well, hang on what difference does it make to innocent civilians who are killed? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1462.36s)]
*  whether one whether one has a [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1467.3999999999999s)]
*  better [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1470.44s)]
*  You know motivation for doing it because my problem with what israel's doing in gaza is that in direct contrast? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  To what it did in lebanon with hesballah in direct contrast to what it did in iran [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1478.22s)]
*  Both very precise very targeted very successful operations minimal civilian casualties in gaza [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1483.8200000000002s)]
*  Well, hang on the guy in gaza gaza the strategy has been completely different [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1491.2600000000002s)]
*  It's been a strategy of of sort of nihilism where they just destroy everything in gaza almost every hospital is either now [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1495.98s)]
*  Well, hang on. Let me finish is either destroyed or damaged in some way [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1503.0200000000002s)]
*  We know this actually because we have to listen to british doctors [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1507.52s)]
*  You've come out and told everybody what is actually going on there because of course international journalists are still banned [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1510.96s)]
*  By the idf even though they were allowed in in previous conflicts in gaza [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1517.28s)]
*  They're not allowed in to verify anything in this one, which I find very suspicious [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1521.44s)]
*  But here's my point elika. I defended israel's right to defend itself after october the 7th not least because [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1525.04s)]
*  The hamas spokesman went public almost immediately and said we want to keep doing this [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1531.92s)]
*  So I completely understand israel's not just a need or a right but a duty to defend its people [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1536.9s)]
*  However, what we've seen in the last few months was a three-month blockade of starvation [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1543.38s)]
*  Of already war-torn impoverished people [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1548.3400000000001s)]
*  And then this constant bombardment including in the last six weeks [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1551.46s)]
*  endless bombardments of people who are desperately [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1556.5800000000002s)]
*  Lining up to get food now. They are dying [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1560.98s)]
*  It seems very mysteriously the idf says we shot in the air as warnings [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1564.28s)]
*  Sometimes they use other language which means they may have shot towards people they saw as a threat or they are now [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1569.56s)]
*  Investigating what happened I read out earlier in a previous debate about this all the different times [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1576.08s)]
*  This has happened in the last six weeks [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1582.28s)]
*  It's endless and the idea that the idf are not killing people in this way what everybody else involved says [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1584.52s)]
*  They are is ridiculous. So the point I think dave is making quite quite straightforwardly [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1591.18s)]
*  Is what the idf's been doing in the last three months to me? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1596.6200000000001s)]
*  crosses any line of self-defense and could absolutely be categorized as terrorizing the innocent people of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1600.22s)]
*  Gaza now it doesn't mean they're not in their heads going in their heads. They're going after hamas [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1608.3000000000002s)]
*  Their motivation is we want to kill the bad guys [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1613.02s)]
*  But they have lost all sense of proportion [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1615.6s)]
*  And they are now behaving in a way that if other people were doing it to them, they would categorize as terrorism [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1617.84s)]
*  Okay, so let me just answer you in in two points. First of all, let me ask you this question if Hamas was entirely separated [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1625.32s)]
*  From the civilian population. Let's say it was totally down north and everyone else. I'm sorry up north and everyone else was down south [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1633.04s)]
*  Do you think that we'd see these civilian casualties? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1639.52s)]
*  No enemy in modern warfare has ever been entirely separated from civilian populations for the birds [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1641.54s)]
*  Well, it doesn't happen [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1647.5s)]
*  My brother and my brother-in-law were both army colonels, right? It's just it's for the birds [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1650.5s)]
*  It's like this idea you get some clean war where civilians are nowhere near any of it. It doesn't really happen ever [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1655.1399999999999s)]
*  Because you just use the example of Iran you saw the example when those civilians have been killed in modern warfare [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1661.98s)]
*  No civilians, it's the amount of civilians and it is the fact that Hamas it doesn't just embed itself [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1668.56s)]
*  It embeds as many civilians in Lebanon. The fact there are more civilians in Lebanon than there are in Gaza [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1674.34s)]
*  How was it that Mossad was able to target? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1680.4399999999998s)]
*  3000 members of his Bola with a pager device that exploded but in Gaza the only way to deal with it [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1683.76s)]
*  Apparently same situation in Lebanon has Bola live among civilians [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1689.84s)]
*  The only way they can apparently do it in Gaza is to obliterate Gaza and kill tens of thousands of civilians [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1693.72s)]
*  I don't understand the difference [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1700.8600000000001s)]
*  Let me answer the question and then you'll understand what you're doing right now is you're not just [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1703.14s)]
*  Legitimizing her master strategy. You are encouraging it. No, because the whole when did I? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1708.54s)]
*  Let me explain [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1714.3s)]
*  Listening to this right? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1716.3s)]
*  If you let me finish my sentence and then at the end of it you can tell me if you agree should we agree on that? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1719.84s)]
*  Sure [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1725.8s)]
*  Okay, when Hamas intentionally embeds itself amongst civilian populations [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1726.8799999999999s)]
*  The whole point of that strategy is that there'll be so much civilian casualties that the world will look at Israel and say what an [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1732.04s)]
*  Abhorrent pariah state that has lost all legitimacy [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1739.12s)]
*  Okay, so let me finish so let me finish so every time the world does that [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1742.42s)]
*  Every time the world reacts in that way it reinforces Hamas's behavior behavior because it tells them this works [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1747.66s)]
*  So in this moment that you're saying this you are encouraging her master [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1754.42s)]
*  We shouldn't talk about we shouldn't talk about the 50 60 70 thousand [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1758.52s)]
*  We know so we believe 70,000 have been killed of which perhaps [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1767.3799999999999s)]
*  Of which perhaps 25 to 30 thousand are Hamas. We don't know because no one's gonna give me actual figures [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1771.54s)]
*  You should talk about it and you should frame it within the context of look how much destruction there is when terrorists embed themselves in civilian [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1778.34s)]
*  populations [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1786.5s)]
*  Listen where this is just weak [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1792.18s)]
*  We should talk about it with but only in the framework that it's not the fault of the people who are dropping the bombs on the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1793.54s)]
*  People or shooting the people who are the ones hey, you know what you just asked, you know, you just had excuse me [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1799.84s)]
*  You just had your whole thing about let you finish and then you can respond to that [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1804.84s)]
*  So why don't we do the same? I know [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1807.9599999999998s)]
*  You opened by saying that Pierce you got you got interrupted when you said Pierce was running cover for a month by pointing [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1811.76s)]
*  Quiet let me let me know you didn't [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1821.32s)]
*  Listen [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1823.32s)]
*  And then you respond I listen I listen to the garbage [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1826.82s)]
*  All right, stop talking lady, let me just honestly [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1833.02s)]
*  Let me just save you all the time in this debate [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1835.78s)]
*  You wanted to debate me because I'm so wrong about everything and I'm so influential and you wanted to smack it down [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1838.1s)]
*  It ain't gonna be you lady. You're not the one who's gonna stop me. This is just [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1843.6s)]
*  Okay, I'll tell you whatever [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1849.98s)]
*  Okay, good one. Oh, yeah, you really smack down my bad ideas. Anyway [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1851.98s)]
*  You're too stupid to realize how bad ideas are [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1858.6s)]
*  There you go. That's the argument you got. Anyway, can I talk now? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1862.52s)]
*  Sure, okay. So Pierce as always it's just the same thing on repeat here, right? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1866.84s)]
*  So the defense is to go but look the motivation of Israel is pure [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1872.28s)]
*  The motivation of everybody else is evil even though obviously what Israel is doing is objectively [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1877.3s)]
*  Torturing women and children to death as they die with their bones crushed under rubble [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1884.48s)]
*  But still but also Pierce don't let it mess with you that at the highest levels of the Israeli government [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1889.0s)]
*  They've kind of told you what their motivations are here [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1895.2s)]
*  I mean the the South African case that they brought to the International Court of Justice was like [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1898.22s)]
*  90% just direct quotes from Israeli leaders the Prime Minister himself referred to them as amalek when when talking to the military [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1903.9799999999998s)]
*  You got the the finance minister the defense minister [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1911.5s)]
*  Bragging about how nobody's getting any food for a three-month period bragging that not one ounce of grain will get into Gaza [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1916.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry. This is just this is obviously [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1922.82s)]
*  Terrorism it borders on genocide. It's horrifically wrong and for you to use your example of saying like [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1926.9799999999998s)]
*  Oh, this is what I'm saying [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1933.36s)]
*  Is that a guy who robs a store and a cop who comes to stop them are committing the same act because they're pointing a gun [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1934.82s)]
*  At each other. Yeah, but of course in that example, they're [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1941.34s)]
*  Right, but in that no, that's what you said [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1944.6999999999998s)]
*  That's what you said about my point and it was really dumb because in that example there aren't innocent people being slaughtered. Yeah [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1947.5s)]
*  I [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1955.44s)]
*  Like it let me ask you a question, which is this are you comfortable with everything that Israel's done in the last three months? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1958.32s)]
*  Oh, I've always said that there should be dual criticism and that's exactly what my problem has been this whole time [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1964.04s)]
*  Everybody's criticizing Israel, which is fair [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1970.52s)]
*  But why isn't anybody criticizing the reason why Gaza looks like this because Hamas has decided to [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1972.6399999999999s)]
*  They are they are though. I mean I couldn't have been more critical of a mass going back 20 months [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1978.56s)]
*  I mean I still am now I think they're a despicable despicable terror group when they're a despicable terror group [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1982.36s)]
*  I'm committing one of the worst terror attacks in modern times [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1987.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean your piece your earpiece maybe wasn't working for the whole first five minutes of this where me and Pierce both agreed that [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1989.78s)]
*  The previous guest was ridiculous to downplay Hamas's crimes [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=1997.6599999999999s)]
*  Acts of terrorism [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2002.58s)]
*  Elica what I was responding to in terms of what Pierce said to me [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2004.1399999999999s)]
*  He was talking about why is it that we can do targeted military strikes in Iran? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  But we've decided to entirely desecrate Gaza and my response was that not saying that it was right [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2012.4399999999998s)]
*  But I'm saying that when Hamas embeds itself in all of Gaza [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2018.32s)]
*  It is gonna result in ruin and it reinforces the point that I've been making this entire time [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2021.6s)]
*  Not just since October 7th [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2027.04s)]
*  But for the past three years that I've been talking about terrorist regimes [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2028.6399999999999s)]
*  Which is that they bring mass death and destruction everywhere they go most [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2031.9199999999998s)]
*  I agree with that, but I also know I also know that Israel through Mossad have supposedly the most sophisticated [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2037.62s)]
*  Experienced intelligence operation in the world and it was brilliantly seen with the Hezbollah pager attack [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2045.6s)]
*  It was being brilliantly identified by the way [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2053.12s)]
*  They managed to identify all where all the military leaders and nuclear scientists and nuclear sites were gonna be in Iran for Israel to attack [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2055.58s)]
*  From a purely military perspective and intelligence perspective [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2064.2599999999998s)]
*  Israel did an extraordinary job both with dealing with Hezbollah and the Iranian regime [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2068.58s)]
*  However, it does just beg the obvious question [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2073.8999999999996s)]
*  Why were they not able to foresee in any way apparently that Hamas were gonna spend 20 years? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2076.7799999999997s)]
*  Spending the billions of dollars which Netanyahu had encouraged them to have because he believed in divide and rule with the with the Palestinian Authority [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2084.58s)]
*  That they had these billions of dollars and was spending it on creating one of the world's biggest [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2092.3s)]
*  underground tunnel systems to operate from and then how did Mossad not know anything about [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2097.78s)]
*  3,000 Hamas terrorists pouring over its border when they're literally on their border and they're guarding it all day long [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2104.58s)]
*  So I just I just cannot understand how this could have happened [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2111.02s)]
*  And then I don't understand why Israel is responding in a way [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2115.26s)]
*  Which has never responded to anything like this in this way before why why is Gaza and then you add the smodrige [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2119.04s)]
*  Then you have the smodrige quotes Alika where he brazenly talks now last week on camera that the plan now is to [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  cleanse Gaza of Palestinians [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2133.64s)]
*  That is ethnic cleansing. That is a war crime [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2136.44s)]
*  That's obviously wrong. That's obviously good. We need to agree. We need to agree certain things like that because it honestly it's important to me [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2139.56s)]
*  It's not when people don't condemn Hamas I sort of chew now because it's like [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2146.8199999999997s)]
*  The moment he just said he was proud of what I'm asked in I tune out of him as a credible guess [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2152.5s)]
*  But if you're prepared to to admit what's very very few pro-israelis right now will admit which is that some of this strategy is [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2157.1s)]
*  Completely wrong. I think we may get somewhere [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2164.98s)]
*  It's so foundational to acknowledge that fact [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2168.06s)]
*  It is so foundational to say that just because you have the right to defend yourself [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2171.14s)]
*  It doesn't mean that you have carte blanche [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2175.12s)]
*  It is so foundational to acknowledge all of these things to acknowledge the death the destruction all of it [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2176.72s)]
*  This is not what my conversation is about [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2182.96s)]
*  Okay [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2185.32s)]
*  This is not about has there been damage or destruction or whatever the whole point of this conversation is that you're making moral [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2185.68s)]
*  Equivalencies and these moral equivalencies blur the distinction between right and wrong good and evil now you can say that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2192.52s)]
*  But some of these actions look like they are evil in themselves [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2200.36s)]
*  But the what the entire entire conversation always goes down to intent that is what our entire criminal [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2203.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't agree with that. I actually don't agree. You've just said that some of this I'm wrong [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2210.98s)]
*  You've just said that some of the things Israel's been doing are evil, right? You've drawn your own moral equivalency [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2215.22s)]
*  You said both sides. I do hang on hang on both sides are doing evil things. That's surely the point Dave Smith was making [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2221.5s)]
*  No, let me tell you why let me tell you why it's different [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2228.8999999999996s)]
*  Because there is one side that kills ideology to protect its people and there is one side that kills people to protect its ideology [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2231.96s)]
*  That is the difference. I'm gonna give you an example. So you understand the nuance of what I'm trying to say [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2240.48s)]
*  Let's say that there's a room of 100 people [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2245.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2248.5600000000004s)]
*  And in that 100 people you're told that 10 of these people want to kill your people [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2249.04s)]
*  Now if you were to shoot and kill everyone in that room, that is objectively immoral and wrong [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2254.6800000000003s)]
*  Objectively, right but you are doing it out of protection. It's still disgusting and abhorrent and wrong now [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2260.06s)]
*  Let's say at the same time [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2266.52s)]
*  You know that 10 people in that room of innocent civilians are against your ideology and you murdered the entire room [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2268.2999999999997s)]
*  To protect your ideology. Both actions are equally immoral and evil as each other, but the motivation is [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2275.58s)]
*  Completely different and you cannot make equivalencies of those motivations [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2283.2999999999997s)]
*  Right Dave, but you in your own words, you just said that both actions are equally [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2287.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, it sounds a lot like kind of the rationalization that your first guest was saying there Pierce that like well [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2295.18s)]
*  You know everybody serves in the IDF in Israel and therefore we really just got to go after everybody because you never know [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2301.48s)]
*  Who here might be one of our oppressors or something like that? It's all just ridiculous logic and look there's there's not there's the what? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2307.7799999999997s)]
*  What is the intention of an ethnic cleansing campaign is that an unintended consequence as Israel is floating this out, huh? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2314.92s)]
*  It's not an ethnic cleansing campaign [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2324.28s)]
*  Listen this is what just so we know I'm not regurgitating [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2332.08s)]
*  Buzzwords I'm talking about what one of the most powerful people at the absolute top of the Israeli government [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2334.96s)]
*  Their finance minister said look the people the Palestinians in Gaza in the West Bank are they are largely because they were ethnically cleansed [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2340.74s)]
*  Out of where they were living for for generations before that. So no, I'm sorry. It's just what's ridiculous [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2347.66s)]
*  What's yes? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2354.34s)]
*  Yes [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2359.02s)]
*  Yeah, you're talking about the fact that when the war broke out against Israel that some of the camps were [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2360.2599999999998s)]
*  Exiled because some of them were collaborating with the Arabs that were engaging in the war with Israel and other of them [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2366.7599999999998s)]
*  Others of them were not which is why they were [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2372.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2376.04s)]
*  No, actually we are and you don't get to just say we're not gonna [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2380.04s)]
*  You're not answering the point that I've made I clearly said in that example that I gave you that both of those situations were completely [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2385.3199999999997s)]
*  wrong, but that [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2391.68s)]
*  Motivation was different and that is how you know and you haven't addressed that [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2393.4s)]
*  No, I'm sorry. Maybe you're not getting me. Yes [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2397.7000000000003s)]
*  I think it's completely ridiculous for you to just get to claim that the Israeli motivations are pure. I'm sorry, especially once [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2400.46s)]
*  Benjamin okay [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2408.2200000000003s)]
*  You get are you just breaking up you don't get to just claim this is nonsense. You don't get oh [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2410.78s)]
*  My god, you just have nothing except nonsense and interrupting me [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2416.46s)]
*  Okay [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2419.82s)]
*  so when Benjamin Netanyahu goes to the United Nations a couple of weeks before October 7th and has greater Israel on a map where all of Gaza and all of the West Bank are Israel I'm sorry why is it that you just get to give him the assumption that the motivation here wasn't to destroy Gaza ethnically cleanse it and annex it as they're openly talking about doing right now now I'm sure there's some people in Israel who don't have those motivations I'm sure there are some people in [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2420.48s)]
*  Hamas who maybe just wanted to have a two-state solution [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2449.88s)]
*  But still when the overwhelming motivations of the leadership are this impure [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2453.6600000000003s)]
*  I don't think you get to say oh, there's a major difference between because one side's motivation is purely just to get the bad guys [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2458.54s)]
*  Okay, then let's just [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2465.6600000000003s)]
*  Hang on a sec. I want to pivot to Iran because Dave you on [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2467.7000000000003s)]
*  22nd of June and I've obviously talked to you on the show as well around this period [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2473.1000000000004s)]
*  You posted on X Donald Trump's now launched an illegal war of aggression against Iran [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2477.02s)]
*  The risk of an absolute catastrophe is very high and it benefits a non-existent worst of all did on behalf of a foreign government against a country [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2481.22s)]
*  Who posed no threat to us now as things stand it looks increasingly like [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2488.2999999999997s)]
*  Trump brought all this to an end with targeting three nuclear strikes with the b2 [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2494.5s)]
*  bunker buster bombs [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2501.4199999999996s)]
*  We don't know the scale of a damage but even the Iranians are saying significant and [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2503.22s)]
*  The war appears to be now at a ceasefire stage after 12 days, which is being kept in hell, which I'm astonished by [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2508.4199999999996s)]
*  Trump has no desires made it clear to put any boots on the ground or to affect any America driven regime change [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2514.98s)]
*  I think he was misinterpreted when he first talked about that [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2521.9199999999996s)]
*  I think he meant an organic regime change possibly happening a la Syria in December [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2524.3799999999997s)]
*  But we don't know but that was my take on what he said [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2530.0s)]
*  But he certainly clarified that now as he doesn't want Americans to force it [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2532.84s)]
*  What is actually wrong with with what has happened and unfurled here? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2537.04s)]
*  I mean given what the atomic agency report made clear that the Iranians have been [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2540.52s)]
*  enriching uranium from a safe civilian usage of three and a half four percent to sixty percent in rapid time [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2545.44s)]
*  And they were hiding information. They were obfuscating. They weren't allowing proper full transparent inspections and so on [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2552.68s)]
*  Is there really anything ideological on putting aside Gaza putting aside everything else purely on the? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2560.24s)]
*  Imminent apparently imminent threat by imminent [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2567.76s)]
*  I mean in the next few months that the Iranians would have had an ability to weaponize their uranium [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2570.36s)]
*  Quite quickly to 90% and potentially create up to 10 nuclear bombs having assured the world [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2576.16s)]
*  They wouldn't do that [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2582.4s)]
*  They are supporting and promoting every terror group going from Hezbollah to the Houthis to Hamas to destroy [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2583.24s)]
*  Israel if you're Israel [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2590.0s)]
*  Why would you not preemptively strike and if you're the United States and you've got the leaders of? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2591.64s)]
*  The Iranian regime saying death to America and encouraging that chart. Why would you also not want to neutralize the nuclear sites? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2597.24s)]
*  Well, let me let me start by saying that I really am just absolutely thrilled that [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2606.12s)]
*  number one that the Iranians gave that warning and that their response was kind of like [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2611.76s)]
*  You know one of those Iranian responses where we want to seem tough [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2616.96s)]
*  But we sure do want to make sure we don't kill any Americans that could get us destroyed [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2620.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm thrilled that Donald Trump took that off ramp and immediately started pushing a ceasefire [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2624.52s)]
*  I mean who knows what's gonna happen [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2629.8799999999997s)]
*  but thank God that he did that because I think all I think all same people around the world should be thankful that he [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2631.3999999999996s)]
*  Took that off ramp and this didn't lead to a catastrophe [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2638.7599999999998s)]
*  But no, I mean I think that I think [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2641.56s)]
*  Essentially your question is all flawed [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2645.4s)]
*  I mean even in the IAEA report that you're referring to they also [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2647.12s)]
*  reiterated that Iran doesn't have a nuclear bomb and that they have not made the decision to start pursuing one and so there was no [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2650.7999999999997s)]
*  imminent threat listen even Benjamin Netanyahu in his interview with Brett Bayer who always [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2656.96s)]
*  Pierce's you know has a long history of just making up how long the Iranians are to developing a nuke even he said maybe a [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2661.92s)]
*  Year-13 months, but the point is that in order for them to do that [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2668.48s)]
*  They would have had to kick the inspectors out and then it would have taken them at least [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2672.0s)]
*  At least a matter of years to develop a nuclear bomb if they had made the political decision to start seeking one [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2676.7599999999998s)]
*  And then it would have taken me [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2683.04s)]
*  My point do you think Iran should have a nuclear bomb? No, I don't think anybody should have nuclear weapons [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2685.6s)]
*  I certainly think Iran should have one given how much it supports terrorist groups. Well [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2691.44s)]
*  I will answer that question. Let me just say the point I was I was making there is just that there was no imminent threat [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2697.4s)]
*  We had more than enough time to do what the American legal system requires in this situation [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2702.36s)]
*  Which is that you bring it to Congress so that the people theoretically can have a debate through their representatives [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2707.64s)]
*  Making that argument and I replied to her almost every military strike ordered by an American president this century [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2715.0s)]
*  Has been done without prior congressional approval [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2721.36s)]
*  Yeah, but what type of argument is that Pierce every war since World War two has been fought undeclared that doesn't mean it's the proper [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2724.92s)]
*  If you go for congressional approval inevitably it will leak out and you lose the element of surprise [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2732.4s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2738.52s)]
*  But then the argument also is that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the founders very intentionally placed [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2739.44s)]
*  War-making power in the Congress because they didn't want it to be they didn't want the president to have the war-making powers of a king [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2745.2000000000003s)]
*  And make military strikes as well, they just can't declare war [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2754.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's some debate about that amongst constitutional scholars [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  But yes, but that refers to like an imminent threat which by all accounts this wasn't now listen [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2761.48s)]
*  I don't want Iran to get a nuclear weapon [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2767.6800000000003s)]
*  I think that everything that US foreign part [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2770.76s)]
*  But basically all of us and Israeli foreign policy seems to have been geared around [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2772.92s)]
*  Incentivizing them to make one for about as long as I've been alive, which I think is very counterproductive [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2777.64s)]
*  But I will say that I think there is a couple thoughts here that I think people should really consider and number one that I [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2783.36s)]
*  Don't you know, I still think that Donald Trump as great as it is that he walked us back from this [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2790.92s)]
*  I think it was totally reckless and and wrong for him to launch it to begin with but [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2796.0s)]
*  think about this [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2801.72s)]
*  the whole [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2803.36s)]
*  foundational claim for the Hawks [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2805.04s)]
*  Justification about Iran getting a new care because obviously lots of really really bad people have had nuclear weapons in the history of the world [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2807.64s)]
*  And that's not a good thing but like Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong and like, you know today current Vladimir Putin China [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2814.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's lots of really bad regimes that have nuclear weapons [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2821.16s)]
*  it's almost never been on the table among serious people that we ought to [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2824.7999999999997s)]
*  Launch a war of aggression and choice because a regime but the claim here is that Iran is so crazy [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2829.6s)]
*  There are these religious fundamentalists and self-preservation simply isn't a motivating factor for them [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2836.2599999999998s)]
*  And therefore they can't be allowed to get it. You wouldn't you wouldn't dispute [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2841.8199999999997s)]
*  You wouldn't you wouldn't dispute the central argument that Israel has about it [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2847.98s)]
*  Which is the Iran has been the main sponsor for Hamas the Houthis and Hezbollah for a number of years [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2853.02s)]
*  All of whom are terror groups wedded to eliminating Israel. You wouldn't dispute that [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2859.7s)]
*  I I don't dispute that they have they have supported those groups and I don't dispute that that's the [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2866.22s)]
*  Existential threat to Israel [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2873.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm sorry, but Israel [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2875.14s)]
*  No [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2877.22s)]
*  Listen if Israel is the only country in the Middle East who secretly has nuclear weapons and is not a member of the non-proliferation [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2877.7s)]
*  Treaty and they also funded Hamas. So I'm sorry [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2884.62s)]
*  I do not think it's a legitimate justification for them to launch a war because they claim someone else is making nukes when they're not [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2887.7799999999997s)]
*  And also they also funded Hamas [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2893.46s)]
*  Can I respond to this now first of all this claim that there's no evidence that the regime is making nukes is totally false [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2898.1400000000003s)]
*  It's totally false. We know that they've enriched to 60% which means then 90% of the way there [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2904.94s)]
*  There's no reason to have anything above 3 to 5 percent for civilian use [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2910.46s)]
*  Everybody understands that 60% the only purpose of it is for nuclear weapons [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2915.34s)]
*  Now for a long time the US and the Western world have been trying to delay the breakout time [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2920.2799999999997s)]
*  That was the whole point of the JCPOA and all of these other deals was that we know that they're months away, right? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2925.2799999999997s)]
*  That's why you keep saying oh, they've been months away for years, right? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2931.8799999999997s)]
*  But they've been trying to extend the breakout time from months away to at least a year away for the past 10 to 15 years [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2934.52s)]
*  So actually everybody is fully fully aware that the regime has always been months away from developing nuclear weapons [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2941.3599999999997s)]
*  now second of all again, it's making these moral equivalencies between [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2949.8s)]
*  The United States or different countries or Israel or whoever having nuclear capabilities [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2954.96s)]
*  What you're talking about here is a regime whose fundamental [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2960.0s)]
*  Motto its entire basis of existence is death to Israel and death to the United States [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2964.2400000000002s)]
*  That is what it stands for that is what its leaders chant on a daily basis [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2970.36s)]
*  That is what school children have to chant in the playground before they start school every day death to America death to Israel [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2974.88s)]
*  Every day their strategy is how do we destroy the United States and how do we destroy Israel now when you have an expansionist? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2982.32s)]
*  ideology that has [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2990.76s)]
*  eschatological beliefs about the end of the world and the end of Israel and the desire is to proliferate and export its [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=2993.04s)]
*  Ideology of Eliat a faculty not just to the Middle East but to the entire world and you say I don't understand [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3000.1200000000003s)]
*  What's the difference between them having nukes and others having nukes that is just profoundly misguided second of all [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3005.6400000000003s)]
*  second of all I didn't say that [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3013.36s)]
*  Second of all this isn't just about the threat of the nukes themselves [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3015.76s)]
*  I don't think anyone's thinking to themselves that Iran that the Islamic Republic's just gonna drop a nuke as soon as it has one [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3020.0s)]
*  The whole point of it reaching nuclear capabilities is that it becomes a deterrent state [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3026.4s)]
*  Once it becomes a deterrent state. How are you going to deter its bad behaviors? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3032.2400000000002s)]
*  How are you going to prevent its alliances with its regional proxies? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3036.52s)]
*  How are you going to prevent more October 7th when everything you try to do to sanction them and contain them is met with? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3040.12s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3046.4s)]
*  We've got nukes and it also prevents the containment of the region because now UAE [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3047.4s)]
*  Egypt all of these other countries are so under threat that they also have to develop nuclear capabilities [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3052.96s)]
*  So it is actually allowing them to get that far that would be the cause of regional and global instability [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3058.4s)]
*  So it's just preposterous to say that we should have just done nothing about that or got into another deal that just kicked the can [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3064.6s)]
*  Down the road again. We are in the position that we are in because nobody [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3070.72s)]
*  Contained this for as many decades as it's been a growing threat. We've passed the Neville Chamberlain moment [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3075.6s)]
*  Okay, totally. It's just total bullshit. I mean just listen the reason why now this 60% enrichment which [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3082.16s)]
*  Obviously for anyone paying attention was there is another reason besides they were developing a nuclear weapon [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3089.28s)]
*  Which again all of the intelligence says they were not they had not even made the political decision that they wanted to develop a nuclear weapon yet [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3094.84s)]
*  Let alone weren't doing it. It was a chip to bargain away, which is actually what they were trying to do [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3101.96s)]
*  They were in the middle of negotiations when Israel snuck attack them and [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3107.62s)]
*  Hang on that means you concede that what they were doing was creating the impression that they were going to build a nuclear bomb. Oh [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3114.3399999999997s)]
*  Listen, there's no question that they upped the enrichment. But listen, here's the point. They weren't allowed to under the JCPOA [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3122.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay under the JCPOA [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3130.42s)]
*  When America was involved they weren't allowed to enrich to this level [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3132.98s)]
*  But they were allowed to do it if America pulled out that's in the JCPOA agreement [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3136.8s)]
*  And so when Donald Trump tore that up and so when Donald Trump tore that up and walked away [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3141.2000000000003s)]
*  They brought their enrichment up [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3145.7000000000003s)]
*  What were the negotiations Pierce that were happening right before Israel launched their surprise attack? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3147.38s)]
*  It was for Iran to bring the enrichment back down and America to get back in some type of agreement [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3152.76s)]
*  They weren't gonna call it the JCPOA because Donald Trump would have had to make it his own thing [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3158.2200000000003s)]
*  60 days to negotiate said yes said you got 60 days and day 61 Israel attacked [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3162.42s)]
*  Right. Okay now now but what was happened and this was widely reported and Donald Trump himself acknowledged this is that the Hawks [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3168.9s)]
*  Insisted that you put a poison pill in the negotiations [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3176.5s)]
*  This is what Marc Levin was freaking out about and that the standard has to be that Iran must give up all nuclear enrichment [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3179.66s)]
*  All together. This was always a poison pill [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3186.3s)]
*  The point is that Iran was willing to negotiate and so if you really wanted to get back into that deal [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3188.9s)]
*  Donald Trump honestly just never should have torn up the JCPOA and we'd all be in a much better situation [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3195.06s)]
*  Ushered in a new inspection regime [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3200.86s)]
*  And so we know this is why we know that they're enriching up to 60% [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3203.22s)]
*  Because they're still in the agreement and they still have the inspections unlike is [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3207.02s)]
*  Let me ask you this you I'm sure if since you know about the JCPOA [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3212.02s)]
*  I know I'm sure you know that it was replete with sunset provisions for up to 10 to 15 years where all of those [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3216.2599999999998s)]
*  Containment would would be expired and they would have more than 150 billion dollars to continue developing their missiles and nuclear programs [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3222.74s)]
*  It was never the JCPOA was never a solution [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3230.8199999999997s)]
*  Not only that not only that but not only did they inherit more than a hundred billion dollars [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3233.8999999999996s)]
*  They were also able to expand their regional terror [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3238.74s)]
*  They were and how many repeatedly came on television and said we are going to use that money to fund our allies [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3242.02s)]
*  So there was actually a back door to the JCPOA where the regime the Islamic Republic was able to [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3248.42s)]
*  Expand its regional influence and fund its allies which eventually led to October 7th [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3254.54s)]
*  Which eventually brought us to where we are now. So yes, the JCPOA did intend to temporarily [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3260.18s)]
*  Constrain their nuclear abilities, but it was always understood that by the time it expired they would be a hundred fifty billion dollars richer [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3266.5s)]
*  Their proxies would be fortified. They would have been [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3273.26s)]
*  responsible for significant regional [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3276.98s)]
*  destabilization and then they would be able to enrich if they wanted to and the only way to prevent that was to get into another [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3280.2200000000003s)]
*  Nuclear deal which would require unfreezing hundreds and billions of more so they would just keep getting enriched rich and empowered [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3286.38s)]
*  So the question is how does this end just a lifetime of JCPOA's? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3293.42s)]
*  Let me ask you a question just to end this because we run out of time Dave [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3298.66s)]
*  Hang on let me put a question today [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3303.38s)]
*  Which is that if if it turns out that all this activity in the last two weeks [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3305.78s)]
*  Drives Iran to the negotiating table. They do agree to give up a lot of their [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3311.66s)]
*  Enriched uranium and so on reduce it back to civilian levels and so on and there is a period of sustained [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3317.7s)]
*  Peace in the region and the Gaza hell is brought to an end as well. And in six months time all this is over [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3323.8199999999997s)]
*  Should Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize because Barack Obama got one eight months into his tenure [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3331.66s)]
*  For basically just doing a bit of chat fancy chat about world peace [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3337.06s)]
*  Well, I guess grading on the Obama curve. Everybody deserves a Nobel Peace Prize [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3341.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean literally the three of us are much better candidates than Barack Obama was so I don't yeah judging on that curve [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3346.46s)]
*  No, look, I mean, I think that would be great if that's the the result of all of this [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3352.86s)]
*  I think that what Don Donald Trump's policy was so reckless and it had such a risk and this is what I was trying [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3357.06s)]
*  To get out before that. I hope people appreciate look if Iran had not made the calculation to give advanced warning [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3364.5s)]
*  And had just fired off missiles the way they did [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3372.06s)]
*  Israel [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3374.86s)]
*  Well, but this is the whole point Pierce. I think Trump [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3376.02s)]
*  I think Trump called that bluff because he realized he realized that what Israel had done over a period of days is [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3379.42s)]
*  Exposed the Iranian regime as having a military that was a duck [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3386.94s)]
*  They don't want to be destroyed they would rather rule than be destroyed [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3394.6200000000003s)]
*  But but the point is that we put this in the in the hands of the Iranian government if they hadn't done that [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3399.62s)]
*  We may have had to launch a full regime [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3407.54s)]
*  What would Donald Trump have done if 50 or 100 Americans had been killed in an Iranian attack? Well, thankfully that has not [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3409.38s)]
*  Because Iran was so panicky they actually gave prior warnings to everybody to make [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3417.34s)]
*  So maybe they're not such a scary threat after all well [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3422.1800000000003s)]
*  That [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3425.54s)]
*  That's an interesting point if you take away their nuclear weapons and like a final word to you very quickly [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3426.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, you your whole point this whole conversation and everything that you've been saying online is that Israel is engaging in terrorism [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3432.06s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing cleansing all of these things that you claim to be against and yet you are so happy to engage in these deals [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3439.5s)]
*  That enrich the Islamic Republic and its machinery of oppression to hang and lynch and torture women [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3445.7000000000003s)]
*  So if you're so against is if you're so against what Israel is doing if you're so against funding what Israel is doing [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3452.22s)]
*  Why are you so happy to fund this regime in its domestic and regional terror by the same means of empowering them with money? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3458.3599999999997s)]
*  It's almost like it's almost like I'm opposing war across the board [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3468.4199999999996s)]
*  I [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3472.14s)]
*  Know opposing war okay opposing war like by first of all instigating more war down the road, okay? That's the Neville Chamberlain [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3477.18s)]
*  Second of all you are [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3488.8199999999997s)]
*  To be slaughtered killed and hanged so long as in your fantasy [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3494.66s)]
*  And [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3502.14s)]
*  Friend who's better? Okay? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x46x6S2CZqk&t=3506.8599999999997s)]
