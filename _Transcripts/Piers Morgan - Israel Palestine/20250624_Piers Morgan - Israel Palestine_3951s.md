# ‘A Deal With The DEVIL’  Iran-Israel With Candace Owens, Glenn Beck & Bill O’Reilly
**Piers Morgan - Israel Palestine:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic)
*  One of the most striking points about the Iran debate is that President Trump has faced more backlash from America First conservatives than the foreign policy class which reviles him, General H.R. McMaster, Ambassador John Bolton and Chris Christie. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=0.0s)]
*  Among those on TV praising the President, all of whom have previously described him as unfit to be President, and much more unflattering things than that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=12.0s)]
*  But the strongest opposition to the US attack came from within the MAGA base itself. Those on the Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon wing of the movement believe the no more foreign wars principle is not only integral to the MAGA movement, but the entire reason it started in the first place. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=21.0s)]
*  I interview three prominent conservatives, very different takes on Ms. Beck's debate, at various different stages yesterday, including as news of the Iranian retaliation was breaking. Candice, welcome back to Uncensored. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=35.0s)]
*  Thank you. It's good to be back, just in time for World War III. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=46.0s)]
*  Well, yes. Well, before we get there, how is motherhood treating you? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=49.0s)]
*  Motherhood is treating me great. I'm exhausted, as is to be expected with the newborn, but always a blessing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=52.0s)]
*  Well, indeed it is. And I wish you all the very best with that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=58.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=61.0s)]
*  Let's talk about impending World War III, as you put it. You are implacably opposed to what both Israel and now the United States have done here. Why? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=62.0s)]
*  Because, well, first and foremost, just on the MAGA movement level, Trump came out and he gave us a promise that we were not going to be involved in wars. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=73.0s)]
*  And I'm going back to 2015. Why do people get so excited about Donald Trump, who was then an unlikely candidate who was being smeared by the media as being Adolf Hitler? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=82.0s)]
*  Well, it was because he recognized that the American people were being forgotten while we were giving billions of unaccounted billions, by the way, for these never ending wars. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=91.0s)]
*  And so it's one of the earliest reasons that people got behind him and got behind his vision. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=101.0s)]
*  And so we're opposed to a regime change because America as a country has a lot of problems that need to be fixed here first. It's that simple. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=106.0s)]
*  Right. But it's not quite that simple. And I'll explain to you why. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=114.0s)]
*  Because Donald Trump, I think he's not been inconsistent in the sense that in his first term, he wasn't a pacifist. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=117.0s)]
*  You know, he killed General Soleimani. He killed Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, and went after them ferociously. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=125.0s)]
*  He attacked Syria when they killed American troops. You know, he dropped a massive bomb in Afghanistan. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=131.0s)]
*  It wasn't like he never deployed the American military. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=138.0s)]
*  And again, here, what he would argue and has been arguing is he's not declared war on anybody. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=141.0s)]
*  What he's done is very specifically target Iran's nuclear capability because of latest reports coming out, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=147.0s)]
*  which said they had taken the enrichment of their uranium stocks from three and a half percent to 60 percent [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=156.0s)]
*  and that therefore the leap to weaponization was moving at a pace that couldn't be tolerated. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=161.0s)]
*  I've got to say, I kind of agree. Now, if he suddenly commits troops on the ground, then that becomes a different thing altogether. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=167.0s)]
*  But even when Trump talked about regime change, I think he meant from within, as we saw in Syria in December, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=174.0s)]
*  where the people themselves rise up. And if that was to happen, why would that be a bad thing? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=182.0s)]
*  OK, so you're asking a lot of questions here. So first and foremost, the idea that you have to formally declare war on like a piece of paper [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=188.0s)]
*  in order for war to happen is a little bit ridiculous. I mean, he dropped bombs. He dropped bombs in Iran. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=195.0s)]
*  So, yes, we are a part of this war, whether we like it or not. Iran is now speaking and saying that they're going to shut down the Hormuz [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=201.0s)]
*  Straits. There's going to be impact on oil. Why would they do that? Why would they do that when the main victim of doing that would be Iran? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=208.0s)]
*  I mean, 50 percent of China, of the traffic of stuff through there is China, which is one of their allies. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=216.0s)]
*  I don't care. Not my business. The point that I'm making here is that to make the assumption that you can just drop bombs on a country [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=224.0s)]
*  and then say, well, you know what, we didn't formally declare war is patently ridiculous. I think that is just patently ridiculous. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=232.0s)]
*  But what about when he killed General Sinemani, one of Iran's top military commanders? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=238.0s)]
*  An assassination, a strike, and that, of course, came with some risk. It's a little bit different to be flying out B-6 bombers in the middle of the night [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=241.0s)]
*  and dropping bombs at the behest of Bibi Netanyahu, which brings me to the second point. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=249.0s)]
*  The reason that America wants a regime change in Iran is because Bibi Netanyahu is demanding it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=253.0s)]
*  And that answers the question as to why there is this split in the MAGA movement. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=259.0s)]
*  What we are seeing right now is the infiltration of Israel first people, the neocons, people who have always wanted never ending wars, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=262.0s)]
*  and the people who have recognized that following Israel's foreign policy initiatives has led to America being on the decline. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=269.0s)]
*  And so that's where I stand. I am with the MAGA people who grew up. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=278.0s)]
*  I call us like, you know, generation 9-11, who were told that America was going to be rendered safer, cleaner. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=282.0s)]
*  All we had to do was agree to go to, well, ironically, war with Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=288.0s)]
*  It's all of the same rhetoric dating back to 9-11, all of the same tactics of trying to smear people who are against this war as supporting jihadists. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=295.0s)]
*  It is not my business to infect a to affect a regime change in Iran. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=303.0s)]
*  It's simply not our business. It doesn't impact us one way or the other. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=309.0s)]
*  And we also are completely done with the idea that these decades long idea that we're doing it to spread democracy because we believe in international liberalism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=312.0s)]
*  There was no imminent threat to the United States when Trump made this decision to do what Bibi wanted. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=321.0s)]
*  I want to be clear here. This was not Trump's decision. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=327.0s)]
*  It was Bibi Netanyahu's decision. And that is the reason that he did it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=329.0s)]
*  And we're very aware that Israel is dictating our foreign policy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=332.0s)]
*  And we would now like that to stop. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=335.0s)]
*  OK, but you wouldn't disagree, presumably, that Iran has been the main sponsor of terrorism in the Middle East through the Houthis, through Hezbollah, through Hamas. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=337.0s)]
*  I mean, that's widely accepted and recognized. They've done it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=346.0s)]
*  I think it's widely accepted. No, that's just kind of like... [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=349.0s)]
*  Really? You don't think they have? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=352.0s)]
*  Israel has been a terrorist state. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=354.0s)]
*  Israel right now is imparting a genocide and a holocaust on the Gazan people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=356.0s)]
*  So I'm really over this idea. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=361.0s)]
*  Like somehow Israel has the moral high ground and we have to get behind them. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=363.0s)]
*  I didn't say that. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=366.0s)]
*  Because we've got to go after the bad guy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=367.0s)]
*  I wasn't saying that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=368.0s)]
*  We have. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=369.0s)]
*  Hang on, hang on. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=370.0s)]
*  Look, we can come to Gaza where I think we'll reach agreement about what Israel's government's been doing there in the last few months without any question. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=371.0s)]
*  But it's relevant. If you're going to call Iranians terrorists, if they right now had an open concentration camp where they were mass killing their own people, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=377.0s)]
*  we would all be saying this is ridiculous. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=383.0s)]
*  So it's rich to me that people are concerned about Iran having nukes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=385.0s)]
*  But I'm concerned about Israel who won't even admit that they have nukes having nukes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=389.0s)]
*  Well, at the same time, they are executing a genocide and a holocaust in Gaza that the world is watching. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=392.0s)]
*  So who's the bigger terrorist is the question today. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=398.0s)]
*  I would say as an American that if we're going to get behind a regime change, it should be in Israel first. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=401.0s)]
*  So that would be my position. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=408.0s)]
*  I think the position of a lot of people who are waking up to the fact that Zionism has brought us nothing but grief in America. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=411.0s)]
*  Can you name one positive thing that Zionists have contributed to America that us fighting these perpetual wars on behalf of Zionism has contributed to America? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=417.0s)]
*  But can you also recognize that Israel placed where it is as a tiny thumbprint in the middle of a region where you have massive countries full of a lot of people that want to wish them harm? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=425.0s)]
*  And in the case of the terror groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis actually want to get rid of Israel and all Israelis altogether. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=439.0s)]
*  Can you accept that if you have a huge nation like Iran with 90 million people and they are facilitating me terror groups to that purpose, that Iran has to defend itself? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=448.0s)]
*  Now, I would not disagree with you about what has been going on in Gaza the last few months. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=459.0s)]
*  I've been very vocal in my criticism of that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=464.0s)]
*  Nor do I disagree, by the way, that it wouldn't help Israel if they did have regime change and Netanyahu wasn't prime minister anymore. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=466.0s)]
*  So on those points, I think we have agreement. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=472.0s)]
*  But I come back to the fact that the reason Trump has done this, I think, is that he has for a long time said Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=474.0s)]
*  I think he's absolutely right to believe that would be a pretty terrifying escalation of the power of a country that's been so wedded to terrorism in the region. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=484.0s)]
*  And I think he took the action for that reason. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=496.0s)]
*  So I don't really agree that he's only doing it because Bibi Netanyahu wants him to go along and do it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=498.0s)]
*  I think he's doing it because he believes it's in America's strategic interest that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=504.0s)]
*  Enough about 9 to 5. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=511.0s)]
*  What about the most important bit, the 5 to 9? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=513.0s)]
*  It should be the most comfortable part of your day. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=516.0s)]
*  And today's sponsor can help. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=518.0s)]

*  We know that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=589.0s)]
*  Obama was the big... [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=590.0s)]
*  Obama did more strikes than anybody. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=591.0s)]
*  Obama never wants anybody. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=593.0s)]
*  I'm not an Obama supporter. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=595.0s)]
*  That doesn't make it okay. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=596.0s)]
*  That argument, just so we're clear, saying, well, we've been doing it wrong forever, so we should just keep doing it wrong, is not an argument that's right. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=597.0s)]
*  I don't disagree with you about that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=603.0s)]
*  Okay, so I disagree with Obama doing it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=605.0s)]
*  I disagree with Trump doing it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=606.0s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=607.0s)]
*  And especially when what we're talking about is what could rise to be a nuclear war. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=608.0s)]
*  We should have done things the right way. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=612.0s)]
*  And he had indicated that he was going to wait two weeks, and then he didn't wait two weeks because Bibi Netanyahu, at least according to the Israeli press, if you believe it, said, we're not waiting two weeks. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=614.0s)]
*  We want this on immediately. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=622.0s)]
*  But I will say, you are correct. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=624.0s)]
*  He's not just doing this because Bibi Netanyahu demands it. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=625.0s)]
*  He's also doing it because Miriam Adelson demands it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=628.0s)]
*  He took $100 million from Miriam Adelson. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=631.0s)]
*  It was very clear what she wanted. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=634.0s)]
*  She was clear that she wanted to annex the West Bank. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=636.0s)]
*  So there was an imperialist plan that was put into place. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=639.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, when you do a deal with the devil, you're going to have to eventually deliver the pound of flesh. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=642.0s)]
*  And that is what Trump is doing, in my opinion. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=649.0s)]
*  And more evidence of that is the fact when he tweeted that there could be a Trump hotel in Gaza. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=651.0s)]
*  I mean, that was truly, in my opinion, the most inhumane thing he's ever tweeted. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=658.0s)]
*  I think he was pretty clear what he was doing there was pretty clear. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=663.0s)]
*  He's saying he wants a better life for Palestinian people, a life where they have beaches, hotels, golf courses. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=667.0s)]
*  And Jared Kushner's private equity firm and their ties to what's happening in Israel and Jared Kushner being on camera shortly after October 7 saying, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=674.0s)]
*  wow, that property could be worth a lot of money. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=681.0s)]
*  It makes me a little bit uncomfortable. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=684.0s)]
*  It makes Americans a little bit uncomfortable. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=686.0s)]
*  Now, you've asked me to come on to your show to explain to you how the now very fractured magma movement is going. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=688.0s)]
*  And I'm telling you that, right? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=693.0s)]
*  No, no, it's really, I find it honestly, I do also, I find it really, I find the split in the conservative movement in America genuinely fascinating. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=695.0s)]
*  Because it really is a genuine schism now. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=702.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a genuine schism and it's only going one direction. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=705.0s)]
*  And by the way, we shouldn't even call this a schism because trying to dress this up and delude us into believing that the MAGA movement is what has Megan McCain cheering, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=708.0s)]
*  John Bolton cheering, has Mark Levin cheering, the literal faces of the Never Trump movement are saying this is real MAGA. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=716.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're not going to be that deluded. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=724.0s)]
*  You're on the same side as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=726.0s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=729.0s)]
*  You're asking about the MAGA movement. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=730.0s)]
*  The MAGA movement has always been a movement that explicitly did not want to keep involving our sons and daughters in the Middle East. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=732.0s)]
*  So we have not changed that position. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=739.0s)]
*  If AOC was always anti-war, then she should have thrown on a red hat in 2020 and in 2015 and joined the MAGA movement. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=740.0s)]
*  That would have been fantastic. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=747.0s)]
*  But are you saying America should never use any military action? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=748.0s)]
*  You're on the same side as Greta Thunberg when it comes to the Palestinians being murdered every day. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=751.0s)]
*  I am, I'm aligned. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=755.0s)]
*  OK, but are you saying that America should never use any military action? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=756.0s)]
*  No, I'm not saying America can never use any military action. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=760.0s)]
*  In fact, what I said earlier was I could get behind a regime change in Israel because I think it would fix a lot of issues that are happening and that has been happening to America over time. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=763.0s)]
*  But why wouldn't you want to in Iran? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=771.0s)]
*  I'm reading an Amnesty International report from 2024. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=773.0s)]
*  Because Iran is not negatively impacting. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=776.0s)]
*  I'm answering your question because Iran's regime is not negatively impacting America's America on a day to day basis. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=779.0s)]
*  When the leader of Iran says death to America, why doesn't that concern you? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=785.0s)]
*  OK, that's a chant. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=790.0s)]
*  And by the way, I want to be very clear. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=792.0s)]
*  Why are they chanting death to America? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=793.0s)]
*  Why are they chanting that? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=796.0s)]
*  That's kind of a random thing. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=797.0s)]
*  Because they want Americans dead? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=798.0s)]
*  But why do they want, why are they specifically chanting as opposed to saying, I don't know, death to China or death to Russia? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=800.0s)]
*  What is it specifically about America? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=808.0s)]
*  They say death to America, death to Israel, death to the United Kingdom, actually. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=810.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=813.0s)]
*  Death to pretty much anyone that wants to stand up to them. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=814.0s)]
*  Could have had something to do with our actions in the Middle East is why I'm saying that we need a change in foreign policy. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=816.0s)]
*  Maybe it has something to do with just like killing a million Iraqi civilians. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=822.0s)]
*  Civilians, OK, because Dibinet and Yahoo got on a congressional stage and said there are weapons of mass destruction. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=826.0s)]
*  And we took that to the bank and there actually were no weapons of mass destruction. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=831.0s)]
*  So we just killed a million. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=834.0s)]
*  It could have something. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=835.0s)]
*  I could be crazy. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=836.0s)]
*  I think something to do with our actions in the Middle East. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=837.0s)]
*  The fact that we have two thousand troops stationed in Syria right now under the guise of saying that we're fighting ISIS. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=840.0s)]
*  Well, at the same time, we know that Dibinet and Yahoo funded the Al Qaeda adjacent front because he wanted to overthrow Syria. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=846.0s)]
*  And they again expand their borders, immediately take on territory and sell us absolute nonsense. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=853.0s)]
*  We're talking about funding Hamas. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=858.0s)]
*  Dibinet and Yahoo funded Hamas. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=860.0s)]
*  There is footage of Dibinet and Yahoo saying this stuff on camera. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=861.0s)]
*  So it's just so ridiculous to me to pretend that they're in some predicament, that they're they may be eradicated soon, which is why they have to keep funding all of these terrorist groups and then pretending that they're victims of terror of terror. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=865.0s)]
*  When, in fact, they are people that are imparting it worldwide. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=876.0s)]
*  You know, I just think that, like I said, generation 9-11 has grown up and I think that our eyes are very clear here and we recognize that our relationship with Israel has become increasingly problematic. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=879.0s)]
*  And it always was problematic. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=890.0s)]
*  So I'll again ask the questions, Piers, I'm asking you because we're having a conversation. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=891.0s)]
*  Name something positive that our Zionist APAC foreign policy has brought to America. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=894.0s)]
*  Well, I think the positive side of if you want an answer about that is that America has been Israel's steadfast ally because it recognizes as a country that Israel has been under an almost unique multifaceted threat on its border for a very long time from people that want to destroy it. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=901.0s)]
*  And you know that you may not see that as a benefit, but Israel has been very supportive to the United States in many ways. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=920.0s)]
*  Right. So why shouldn't America? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=928.0s)]
*  I just want something concrete that has been benefit. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=930.0s)]
*  Like we got better in America in this way. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=932.0s)]
*  Just name something gas prices, just something that the average American can relate to. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=935.0s)]
*  You're not going to have a correlation between Zionism and gas prices in America. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=939.0s)]
*  Of course, you're not. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=944.0s)]
*  I'm just I'm just giving you an example. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=945.0s)]
*  There are obvious tangible benefits. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=946.0s)]
*  Your argument here is like, well, you get a pat on the back and you can say that you helped this country, which was formed in 1948 by pretending to be refugees, if you will, and being invited into the homes of Palestinians. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=949.0s)]
*  The horrific story of what happened. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=962.0s)]
*  Well, they weren't pretending to be refugees. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=963.0s)]
*  They were people fleeing a Holocaust. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=965.0s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=967.0s)]
*  Let me finish my statement. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=968.0s)]
*  What do you mean pretending to be refugees? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=969.0s)]
*  Let me finish my statement. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=971.0s)]
*  When I say pretending to be refugees and being invited into the home, you would think that these people were helpless and were going to be grateful to the people that hosted them. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=972.0s)]
*  People like Mohammed Hadid, Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid's father, who was an infant at this time in his mother's arms. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=980.0s)]
*  She had just given birth. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=985.0s)]
*  They had invited these refugees because of the goodness of their heart. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=987.0s)]
*  And then one day they were turned home and their doors are locked and they are told that if you try to enter, you are going to be shot and killed. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=990.0s)]
*  That is the reality of how Israel was established as a state. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=997.0s)]
*  That is not a stain that you can wipe from history. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1000.0s)]
*  Most Americans growing up actually believe what happened was that, OK, it was a little messy. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1002.0s)]
*  That's what happens after wars. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1007.0s)]
*  Borders get changed. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1008.0s)]
*  But at the very least, they were given money. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1009.0s)]
*  I mean, you've lived here for hundreds and hundreds of years. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1011.0s)]
*  Here's money for your property. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1013.0s)]
*  No, that's not what happened. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1014.0s)]
*  They were forced out of their homes at gunpoint. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1015.0s)]
*  And it's wrong. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1017.0s)]
*  So we get to be the nation. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1018.0s)]
*  But it was also wrong. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1019.0s)]
*  Candice. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1020.0s)]
*  The thing that America gets. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1021.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1022.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1023.0s)]
*  I'm going to let you finish. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1024.0s)]
*  Let me respond. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1025.0s)]
*  But let me finish. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1026.0s)]
*  But your argument is that what we get to be is that nation that keeps supporting it as they continue to move their borders in this way. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1027.0s)]
*  Now we're seeing that incursion into Gaza. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1033.0s)]
*  And we are certainly going to see it by the end of this administration in the West Bank. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1035.0s)]
*  Because, like I said, that is why Miriam Adelson gave Trump one hundred million dollars. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1038.0s)]
*  As you know, I oppose what the Israeli government is doing now in Gaza. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1043.0s)]
*  I oppose the expansion of settlements on the West Bank. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1047.0s)]
*  I think all of that is completely wrong. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1050.0s)]
*  I do think America supports Israel because it remains the only democracy in the Middle East. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1051.0s)]
*  And that's an important. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1056.0s)]
*  Democracy. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1057.0s)]
*  Stop saying that, Pierce. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1058.0s)]
*  You know better. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1059.0s)]
*  They have elections. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1060.0s)]
*  They have elections. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1061.0s)]
*  But who gets to vote in those elections? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1062.0s)]
*  Do the Gazans get to vote in that election? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1064.0s)]
*  Well, the Israelis get to vote in Israel, obviously. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1066.0s)]
*  OK, so you're basically saying America had a democracy, you know, when we had laws that said black Americans couldn't vote. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1069.0s)]
*  Israel moved out. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1077.0s)]
*  It is indisputable that Israel moved out of Gaza in 2005 and there was an election and Hamas got elected. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1078.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1085.0s)]
*  Now, I agree with you. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1086.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1087.0s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1088.0s)]
*  But Bibi Netanyahu, who was on camera, said that people were going to fund Hamas into power. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1089.0s)]
*  So they orchestrated that because they wanted to create the solution. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1093.0s)]
*  Candice, I'm finished. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1096.0s)]
*  I agree with you that Netanyahu wanted to cause a split between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1097.0s)]
*  It was divide and rule. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1103.0s)]
*  It was a catastrophically bad strategy. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1105.0s)]
*  And it led to what happened on October the 7th, over a 20 year period. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1107.0s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1111.0s)]
*  It was a terrible thing that Netanyahu did. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1112.0s)]
*  One of the many reasons I think he should go. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1114.0s)]
*  But there was no doubt that the Israelis pulled out of Gaza and allowed them to have elections and they elected Hamas. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1116.0s)]
*  And the rest has been disastrous history because Bibi because the Israelis funded because Bibi Netanyahu, they funded Hamas. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1124.0s)]
*  I don't disagree with you, but they still had elections. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1130.0s)]
*  It's like it's like we rigged an election. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1132.0s)]
*  But look what the election results show is that they wanted to put Hamas into power. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1134.0s)]
*  And so when we again, when we talk about who is funding these terrorists, the answer is Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1138.0s)]
*  And I don't want to get into his corruption trials, but every single person watching this right now should go pursue the documentary, the Bibi files, because it is absolutely stunning. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1142.0s)]
*  I believe one of the reasons I believe one of the reasons the question because you still you still haven't given me anything other than like you guys get a pat on the back for supporting this created nation in the Middle East. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1149.0s)]
*  I also just like to say all of the bad things that we have gotten with because of our continued relation with Israel. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1160.0s)]
*  First and foremost, the open borders. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1168.0s)]
*  And you can relate to this people in the UK. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1170.0s)]
*  They just can't seem to connect the dots. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1172.0s)]
*  All right. Oh, my gosh. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1173.0s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1174.0s)]
*  No, but I want to I want to say this. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1175.0s)]
*  OK, we don't understand where all these refugees are coming from. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1178.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. Where are all these refugees coming from? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1182.0s)]
*  Who's funding them coming over into these borders? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1184.0s)]
*  This is what you get when you keep supporting these nonstop wars, when you keep bombing where these people live. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1187.0s)]
*  And it's not even just a conspiracy, by the way, if you're like, oh, well, actually, you're wrong about this because the vast majority of people coming into the UK. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1193.0s)]
*  Illegally are not coming from war torn countries in the Middle East. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1199.0s)]
*  They're actually economic migrants. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1203.0s)]
*  I mean, OK, so so it's not true. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1205.0s)]
*  So let's connect that. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1207.0s)]
*  Let's connect that when you say economic migrants, are we talking about like people who literally want to come to the UK for a better life? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1209.0s)]
*  And when Gaddafi was heading up Libya and the country was on the up and up and he was working with the United Nations and then all of a sudden he warned that if you collapse Libya and turn it into a place where refugees are escaping, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1215.0s)]
*  that this is going to be your problem. Europe, he warned that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1228.0s)]
*  So that it actually happened. Now we're just calling them economic migrants. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1231.0s)]
*  We're going to pretend that we had nothing to do. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1233.0s)]
*  I'm not talking about people coming from Libya. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1235.0s)]
*  OK, where are you speaking about? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1237.0s)]
*  For example, I think it was last year, a third of all the people who came into the UK on the border, on the small boats illegally, it turned out were young economic migrant males from Albania, which last time I checked, we had invaded. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1239.0s)]
*  So let me pull you back to something you said, which has caused a lot of controversy, which is this issue of dishonorable discharges. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1253.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1260.0s)]
*  I do believe that if war in Iran is on the agenda and that appears so, get dishonorably discharged. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1262.0s)]
*  Who cares? Who cares? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1268.0s)]
*  Why should you go die in a foreign land? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1270.0s)]
*  You now have the benefit of 2020. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1273.0s)]
*  You can see, think about those men and those women who died because they were pitched that they were serving their country because there were weapons of mass destruction. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1276.0s)]
*  Right. They were serving their country because the Taliban, they were serving their country, whatever it is, and these people gave up their lives and ask yourselves for what? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1284.0s)]
*  And the answer to that question is for the elites. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1292.0s)]
*  You're like toy soldiers. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1295.0s)]
*  When you said that, were you aware of the repercussions if people dishonorably discharge? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1297.0s)]
*  So just to put this into context, this is like the Q&A, live Q&A portion at the end of my show. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1303.0s)]
*  And being facetious, but also being completely honest that they should begin to consider, and that was somebody asking what should we do? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1308.0s)]
*  Like, should we leave the military because they also are recognising that? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1314.0s)]
*  So do you regret saying that? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1317.0s)]
*  No, I don't regret saying that. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1319.0s)]
*  But you know the repercussions if you do discharge dishonorably. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1321.0s)]
*  OK, well, I would imagine that the people that are in the military who were going to, if they were going to listen to my podcast and they were going to dishonorably discharge, that they would know the consequences. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1323.0s)]
*  So it's completely ridiculous. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1332.0s)]
*  And again, we see this over and over again where people can't answer the broader questions. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1334.0s)]
*  They try to suddenly pick in, well, you said this one thing. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1338.0s)]
*  No, the broader question we are having. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1340.0s)]
*  It's quite a big, there's a lot of small things to suggest. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1342.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1344.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1345.0s)]
*  You're basically, you're encouraging US servicemen and women to dishonorably discharge. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1346.0s)]
*  You play a clip, you play a clip and I'm trying to answer it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1351.0s)]
*  You know, you can't do that. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1353.0s)]
*  You ask a question. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1355.0s)]
*  You're trying to downplay it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1356.0s)]
*  And I'm responding. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1357.0s)]
*  No, I am. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1358.0s)]
*  You're trying to upplay it is what the issue is. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1359.0s)]
*  This is what this is. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1360.0s)]
*  This is exactly what you said. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1361.0s)]
*  You're not. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1362.0s)]
*  You're playing what I said. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1363.0s)]
*  And I'm responding to it and telling you that the broader piece of that conversation, when [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1364.0s)]
*  you have troops that are now asking that question is they are recognizing that America is in [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1368.0s)]
*  steep decline, that our military comes back and they are treated like dirt. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1373.0s)]
*  That a lot of these men, and we're talking about decades, white American males come back [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1377.0s)]
*  and they're told that they're racist and they're treated like crap, that they're white supremacists, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1381.0s)]
*  that they have a different vision for this country. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1385.0s)]
*  So why are they dying in these overseas wars for Bibi Net and Yahoo? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1387.0s)]
*  OK, and let me again try to answer that question that I asked you at the beginning, which is [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1391.0s)]
*  what has Zionism won America? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1395.0s)]
*  What have these never ended? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1397.0s)]
*  No, let me finish. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1398.0s)]
*  Why won't you let me answer that? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1400.0s)]
*  You can answer if you want to. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1401.0s)]
*  People are recognizing you come back and there are open borders and you're told that you [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1403.0s)]
*  are racist. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1407.0s)]
*  OK, you come back and you're told that you are racist if you don't want open borders. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1408.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, you're sent overseas to defend Israel's borders. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1412.0s)]
*  It's a nonsense. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1415.0s)]
*  And who's funding these open borders? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1416.0s)]
*  According to Barry Weiss, and I quote, Barry Weiss said this verbatim, the Jewish connection [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1418.0s)]
*  to the refugee is not a conspiracy. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1423.0s)]
*  That's something that we are very proud of. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1425.0s)]
*  And she was she was reference referencing the organization H I A S. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1427.0s)]
*  And she says it explicitly, which she said what was started by them in the 1880s, which [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1432.0s)]
*  includes people, immigrants that have come in like like Sergey Brin. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1437.0s)]
*  They are still the organization that is operating at our border right now. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1440.0s)]
*  OK, that is problematic. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1443.0s)]
*  That we have open borders while we continually and routinely are told that we have to defend [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1445.0s)]
*  somebody else's borders. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1449.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1450.0s)]
*  And again, these never ending wars in the Middle East at the behest of Israel. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1451.0s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu was the one that called for Americans to invade Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1455.0s)]
*  and now Iran. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1460.0s)]
*  And we've done it. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1461.0s)]
*  We're told Israel can defend itself. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1462.0s)]
*  OK, so but why do we have currently two thousand troops that are in Syria under the guise of [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1464.0s)]
*  fighting ISIS? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1468.0s)]
*  And like I said, we know Israel themselves fund terror, terror adjacent militants like [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1469.0s)]
*  they did to overthrow Assad. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1474.0s)]
*  And we're done with the BS of OK, well, we weren't really they weren't really involved [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1476.0s)]
*  Israel in Afghanistan, because even when we fight those never ending wars, Israel wins. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1480.0s)]
*  Everybody knows that our boys were out there in Afghanistan guarding poppy fields. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1484.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1488.0s)]
*  And you know what happened after we allegedly quote unquote lost in Afghanistan? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1489.0s)]
*  What happened to all those poppy fields, those poppy flowers that our military was guarding? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1492.0s)]
*  Well, the opioid crisis hit America via the Sackler family, who quite literally built [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1497.0s)]
*  the School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1502.0s)]
*  So we're just done. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1504.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1505.0s)]
*  And there's no way that we're going to go backwards. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1506.0s)]
*  We're not going to allow you guys to emotionally condition us to go, oh, well, we got to protect [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1507.0s)]
*  Israel because of the Holocaust. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1511.0s)]
*  It is over. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1513.0s)]
*  They're imparting a Holocaust. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1514.0s)]
*  America would like off this crazy train. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1515.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1517.0s)]
*  For the benefit of viewers who don't know what I was talking about, under the Uniform Code [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1518.0s)]
*  of Military Justice, Article 90, dishonorable discharge can result in forfeiture of all pay [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1522.0s)]
*  and allowances up to five years confinement, which is a pretty heavy penalty to pay. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1527.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd want my kids to go to jail before they fought for Israel. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1532.0s)]
*  I'll say that honestly. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1535.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1536.0s)]
*  I would. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1537.0s)]
*  I have three sons, and I'm going to be honest with you, Pierce. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1538.0s)]
*  I'm glad you told me that consequence. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1540.0s)]
*  I'd take that consequence any day to them being sent back over in a coffin because they [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1541.0s)]
*  died for Israel. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1546.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1547.0s)]
*  But I think the one thing you're missing. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1548.0s)]
*  I come from a big military family, a lot of military in my family, and a lot of people [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1549.0s)]
*  fighting wars on behalf of the United States are not doing it because they think Bibi Netanyahu [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1554.0s)]
*  wants them to. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1559.0s)]
*  They're doing it because they... [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1560.0s)]
*  Well, some of them do that, and they write into my show when I answer the question. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1561.0s)]
*  Well, some might, but many of them won't, and they might be offended by you suggesting [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1563.0s)]
*  that's the only reason they're doing it. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1566.0s)]
*  They can watch your show, and they can be offended all they want, but I think it's more [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1567.0s)]
*  offensive the way that our military is treated, the veterans are treated, and the gasline [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1572.0s)]
*  that takes place when we're told that we have to defend everybody's borders. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1576.0s)]
*  I actually think America treats its veterans better than almost any country in the world. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1579.0s)]
*  I mean, you have... [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1582.0s)]
*  This has always been an open conversation, and I'm just saying that if my boys were being [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1583.0s)]
*  drafted to fight this war in Iran, I would be like, you know what, honey, take the other [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1587.0s)]
*  option. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1591.0s)]
*  And that's not because it's cowardice, it's because when you sign up for the military... [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1592.0s)]
*  OK, but I would say that the pilots... [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1595.0s)]
*  You are pledging that you are doing something that is going to better your country. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1597.0s)]
*  And like I said, our country has been in steep decline since we have been part of this foreign [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1601.0s)]
*  policy, which is just whatever Israel wants. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1605.0s)]
*  OK, you made that point, but what I would say to you is the only people so far that [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1607.0s)]
*  have been involved from the American military were the extraordinarily courageous and [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1610.0s)]
*  skillful pilots who flew these B-2 bombers and attacked the nuclear sites and got back [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1614.0s)]
*  safely. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1620.0s)]
*  So there's been no troops on the ground committed at all, no declaration of war by United [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1621.0s)]
*  States. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1626.0s)]
*  We can... [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1627.0s)]
*  Listen, I don't disagree with you. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1628.0s)]
*  You bombed somewhere. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1629.0s)]
*  You probably are at war with them. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1630.0s)]
*  But there was no official declaration of war, just as Trump, when he took out Soleimani [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1631.0s)]
*  and Baghdadi and he attacked Syria and so on, he didn't declare war on those places. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1635.0s)]
*  And actually it turned out that the apocalyptic warnings of those actions never materialized. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1639.0s)]
*  So we shall see. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1644.0s)]
*  I can't let you go without asking... [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1645.0s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1646.0s)]
*  Let me ask you just quickly about the Tucker Ted Cruz debate. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1647.0s)]
*  What did you make of that? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1651.0s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1653.0s)]
*  It is finally the debate that needed to happen in America because a part of this nonstop [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1654.0s)]
*  policy is this belief, as you said, Ted Cruz, that if we just do whatever Israel wants, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1659.0s)]
*  that God's going to bless you. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1663.0s)]
*  And it's quite ironic because it comes from Protestants and their normal argument is that [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1664.0s)]
*  the reason why we had to have this fracture in the church was because of indulgences. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1668.0s)]
*  There's nothing more indulgent than I'm going to be blessed if I just do whatever Israel says. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1673.0s)]
*  And so because we are finally having that spiritual conversation, which is more important, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1678.0s)]
*  I suspect there's going to be major changes in the United States going forward. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1682.0s)]
*  And that is why you're seeing this fracture in the base already. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1686.0s)]
*  Tucker, according to Donald Trump, Tucker rang Trump to apologize for some of the more strident [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1689.0s)]
*  rhetoric he's used against him recently. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1694.0s)]
*  Are you done with Donald Trump? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1696.0s)]
*  Or could you see a way that you would end up perhaps voting for him? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1698.0s)]
*  You can't run again, obviously, but would you support him publicly again? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1701.0s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1705.0s)]
*  I don't regret voting for Donald Trump above Kamala. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1706.0s)]
*  I think he was the better candidate, certainly a better candidate above Joe Biden. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1709.0s)]
*  But what I will say is that he's been a chronic disappointment. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1713.0s)]
*  And I feel embarrassed that I told people to go vote for him because this wasn't going to happen. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1717.0s)]
*  And it is happening. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1721.0s)]
*  But I just think that the picture of politics in America is going to look very differently [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1723.0s)]
*  because of his actions. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1729.0s)]
*  So I don't know where we go from here. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1730.0s)]
*  I really don't. But this is not the candidate that I voted for. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1732.0s)]
*  If it turns out that his instincts were right, that by doing what he did, it brings Iran to the negotiating table [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1735.0s)]
*  and they do a deal on their nuclear plans, would you admit that you were wrong in that circumstance? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1743.0s)]
*  Yeah, I will always admit when I'm wrong. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1751.0s)]
*  Anybody that listens to my podcast knows that. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1753.0s)]
*  It just so happens to be that especially if I come on the Piers Morgan show [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1755.0s)]
*  and I make some predictions and it ends up that I'm right. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1759.0s)]
*  So I'm feeling I'm feeling lucky, but I will of course admit I'm wrong if that is the if that is a result. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1761.0s)]
*  Candice, always good to have your views on uncensored. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1767.0s)]
*  You know that I appreciate you coming on. Thank you. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1770.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1772.0s)]
*  We're joining me now as the chief executive officer of Blaze Media, Glenn Beck. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1774.0s)]
*  May I say something just to start? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1778.0s)]
*  Would we be having this debate in this way if Hamas would have done to England what they did to Israel? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1780.0s)]
*  Would we be having this debate? Because I don't think we would. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1790.0s)]
*  I think America would be over there. I think the whole world would be over there. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1793.0s)]
*  And we'd pound them into sand until they until they surrendered. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1796.0s)]
*  But I don't understand why we're having debates here on on actions that Barack Obama took and nobody really said anything about it. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1801.0s)]
*  They weren't screaming for an act of war. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1811.0s)]
*  I know this is a very bad situation and I hope to God. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1814.0s)]
*  I mean, I I'm glad that Donald Trump is our president because I wouldn't have had the balls to do it. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1818.0s)]
*  I think it was the right thing to do, but I wouldn't have had the balls to do it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1824.0s)]
*  Well, it's really interesting because I know that historically, I mean, I'm not going to pick on you for this, but I happen to be the editor. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1827.0s)]
*  No, it would be obvious what I'm saying, but I was editor of the Daily Mirror newspaper, one of the big national papers in the UK for many years. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1834.0s)]
*  And I campaigned vociferously on the front page after front page against the Iraq War. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1842.0s)]
*  And it was particularly contentious in the UK because we were the labor supporting newspaper and Tony Blair was a labor prime minister. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1849.0s)]
*  So it was a huge sort of deal over here. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1855.0s)]
*  And I know that you initially supported the Iraq War and then afterwards you later accepted that that had been a mistake, which, you know, again, is part of part of your strength. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1858.0s)]
*  I think, you know, I think, Piers, you you know, you can't silence people when they're wrong because hopefully they're on the road to becoming right. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1869.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1880.0s)]
*  But you only you only get that if you have a debate. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1881.0s)]
*  And I will tell you that I was for Afghanistan. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1884.0s)]
*  I was for I mean, I was a very big war hawk. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1888.0s)]
*  You know, let's go in and just do it. Let's do it. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1893.0s)]
*  I'm not that way anymore because I've seen the pattern. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1895.0s)]
*  It doesn't work out. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1898.0s)]
*  America needs to mind its own business. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1900.0s)]
*  We can't export what we have. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1903.0s)]
*  I mean, I have hopes for the Middle East. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1906.0s)]
*  I have hopes for Iran. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1908.0s)]
*  I pray for the people in Iran. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1909.0s)]
*  They're a very big danger. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1911.0s)]
*  But, you know, I the one thing again, I go back to Donald Trump. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1913.0s)]
*  I don't think he's being duped in 2016. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1917.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1920.0s)]
*  I mean, he has told me he didn't really know what he was up against. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1921.0s)]
*  He knows what he's up against now. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1924.0s)]
*  He hates war, hates it as much as he loves tariffs. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1926.0s)]
*  He hates war. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1930.0s)]
*  He has told me eye to eye about how he has redesigned or he had to rebuild our nuclear arsenal. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1931.0s)]
*  And in a fashion that I've never seen Donald Trump, he said, Glenn, it can never be used. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1938.0s)]
*  It is horrifying what can be done now. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1946.0s)]
*  I know I helped rebuild it. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1949.0s)]
*  It can never be used. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1950.0s)]
*  He hates nuclear war. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1952.0s)]
*  He hates regular war. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1953.0s)]
*  And I think he just I think he really believes he did the right thing. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1955.0s)]
*  And I don't think he's being duped by it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1960.0s)]
*  No. And it's interesting because I know that you were you know, you were hoping he didn't do what he did. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1962.0s)]
*  Now that he's done it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1967.0s)]
*  And obviously, it's incredibly early days. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1968.0s)]
*  And none of us can be sure what is going to happen. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1970.0s)]
*  And I don't I wouldn't even attempt to guess. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1973.0s)]
*  But I certainly think that Trump's intentions were well intentioned. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1976.0s)]
*  I think he has said for many years that Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1980.0s)]
*  And he genuinely believed that enriching their uranium stocks from three and a half percent to sixty percent was a dangerous escalation that could only be heading one way. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1984.0s)]
*  And so he's taken the same action that he did with when he took out Soleimani or Baghdadi when he attacked Syria, when he dropped big bombs in Afghanistan. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=1994.0s)]
*  He's done things strategically as he sees it without actually committing large number of American troops on the ground. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2002.0s)]
*  You also have to look at this. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2009.0s)]
*  Every single president since Clinton has said this. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2011.0s)]
*  Iran has killed more Americans as a nation than I think any other nation has. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2014.0s)]
*  They are they've been an enemy. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2020.0s)]
*  Every single president has said they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2022.0s)]
*  I don't want to go to war with Iran. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2025.0s)]
*  I don't I don't want any of this. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2028.0s)]
*  However, you know, when you talk to a B-2 bomber, which I did over the weekend, they have been running this particular run for 15 years plus. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2029.0s)]
*  We built in White Sands. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2042.0s)]
*  We built the a model of that reactor. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2044.0s)]
*  This bomb that we dropped were the only ones with it in the world. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2049.0s)]
*  It was made for those reactors specifically for those reactors. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2052.0s)]
*  It is so accurate it can hit a the top of a pop can or a Coke can from 50000 feet. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2057.0s)]
*  It had to go into a 10 by 10 foot vent. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2064.0s)]
*  They have been running this over and over again. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2067.0s)]
*  That's not Donald Trump. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2070.0s)]
*  That's the American policy. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2071.0s)]
*  We know that these people are serious when they say they're going to burn first the Jews in the Islamic fiery furnace and then America. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2073.0s)]
*  We're the great Satan. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2082.0s)]
*  They have been a threat of ours for a long time. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2083.0s)]
*  I wish we could have negotiated our way, but it didn't happen. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2086.0s)]
*  So now we're here. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2090.0s)]
*  Now what do we do? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2092.0s)]
*  Well, as we're talking, you know, I'm just going to read this to you. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2093.0s)]
*  Reuters and AFP are reporting explosions over Doha. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2098.0s)]
*  So we're talking Monday evening UK time, Monday afternoon, your time in the States. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2102.0s)]
*  Iranian media saying Iran is attacking US bases in both Qatar and Iraq. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2107.0s)]
*  This follows BBC and Fox News report incredible and imminent threats of Iranian missile attacks on US run air bases. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2113.0s)]
*  So that's just breaking as you and I are talking. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2121.0s)]
*  But clearly that would be a significant escalation. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2125.0s)]
*  If Iran is targeting US air bases now in the Middle East, what do you think that means as we progress forward? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2127.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2136.0s)]
*  I've been saying to my audience, pray for peace, but prepare for war. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2138.0s)]
*  This is a war that I think is coming one way or another. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2144.0s)]
*  I mean, look at look at the state of Europe. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2147.0s)]
*  Look at the state of England. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2150.0s)]
*  Look at the state of America. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2152.0s)]
*  I mean, this is this is a war with Islamists, not Muslims, Islamists that is going to happen at some point. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2154.0s)]
*  I think we are at the beginning of a 50 year war with Islamists. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2163.0s)]
*  And it's it's disturbing to me. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2167.0s)]
*  And the reason why is we're not clear. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2169.0s)]
*  None of our countries, Donald Trump will, but none of our countries will even name what we're against. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2171.0s)]
*  They won't say it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2177.0s)]
*  You know, what I complimented you for doing on this show is actually saying what the truth is and letting all sides, our governments are silencing. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2179.0s)]
*  And I think it's because they're afraid. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2188.0s)]
*  But it is it is it's a war that is absolutely coming. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2190.0s)]
*  And the problem is, I remember I sat in the Oval Office during the Gulf War, the the Iraqi War with George Bush. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2195.0s)]
*  And he was reading me the riot act because I wasn't happy about the way things were going. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2203.0s)]
*  And he said to me, I said, you know, you got an election coming up and what do you think these guys are going to do? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2207.0s)]
*  And he said something and he tried to make me feel better. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2213.0s)]
*  And this actually made me feel horrible. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2216.0s)]
*  He said, Glenn, don't worry about it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2219.0s)]
*  No matter who wins, when they sit behind this desk, they'll be advised by the same voices and they'll realize they have no other options. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2221.0s)]
*  I left that office thinking, then why do we elect a president? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2230.0s)]
*  What is happening? We have to break this cycle. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2235.0s)]
*  Hopefully this this we're not being lulled into something or pulled into something that is long planned. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2239.0s)]
*  Hopefully we can end this quickly and and return to some normalcy in all of our countries. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2248.0s)]
*  But we have to face the truth. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2257.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I completely concur with you. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2259.0s)]
*  And like I said, I you know, I whilst I can absolutely understand why Donald Trump did what he did and why I think there's a compelling argument that Iran was fast accelerating its way to a nuclear weapon, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2262.0s)]
*  which everybody basically agrees apart from Iran and its allies would be a very bad thing for the world. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2274.0s)]
*  Once you do strike in the way that the United States struck with these bunker buster bombs, you cannot then control the way the narrative plays out. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2281.0s)]
*  You don't know how the receiving end of that is going to respond. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2292.0s)]
*  I think that that our side is hoping that they are so weakened that they they don't have much fight left in them. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2296.0s)]
*  I would I would hope that. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2306.0s)]
*  However, you're you know, if if I said on Friday or Saturday when it happened that if if somebody did that to us and just blew up one of our bases in the United States here in our continental US, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2309.0s)]
*  we would declare that that's a declaration of war. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2325.0s)]
*  Yeah. And why would we expect them not to feel that way? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2328.0s)]
*  The only hope is that they're so weakened that it it can end quickly. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2332.0s)]
*  I don't think I mean, I think this sort of this attempt to try and pretend it's not a declaration of war. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2336.0s)]
*  I don't think that flies. I mean, I posted on X. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2341.0s)]
*  This is America saying it's a war with Iran. Right. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2344.0s)]
*  I mean, you drop 30,000 pound bombs all all over the place on nuclear sites in a foreign country. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2347.0s)]
*  You are except except we've done that before. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2352.0s)]
*  Except we've done that before. Yeah. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2355.0s)]
*  In other cases, and nobody's had this reaction, but it's not Iran and Israel. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2358.0s)]
*  For some reason, that's just totally different for everybody. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2364.0s)]
*  I mean, what's strange about that whole thing is if you go back into the not too distant past of Iran and Israel, you know, before the revolution, the seventy nine, they got on pretty well. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2367.0s)]
*  You know, it's like a lot of these relationships have been contaminated in the last 40, 50 years. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2378.0s)]
*  So I'm doing a show to what Thursday appears that I'm glad you brought this up because my I was just talking to my producers about the direction I want to go in. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2385.0s)]
*  And that is look at Europe today. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2394.0s)]
*  Look at England today. Then look at Iran. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2396.0s)]
*  Nineteen seventy seven. Nineteen seventy five. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2400.0s)]
*  Look, nobody was wearing hijabs. Nothing like that. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2404.0s)]
*  And in 1979, it's over. It's lights out. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2408.0s)]
*  We can't ignore the poison of Islamists in our own society. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2411.0s)]
*  We all think that it's not going to happen. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2417.0s)]
*  It can't happen, but it can. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2420.0s)]
*  All we have to do is make the distinction between Islamist and a Muslim. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2422.0s)]
*  One is our enemy. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2427.0s)]
*  The other is a practitioner of a religion. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2429.0s)]
*  I mean, I would expand that to say it's extremism, right? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2431.0s)]
*  Extremism of any kind should be condemned by all right thinking people. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2435.0s)]
*  Because extremism is never the right way. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2440.0s)]
*  Just by the very definition. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2442.0s)]
*  When are we going to do that? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2443.0s)]
*  By the very definition of the word. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2444.0s)]
*  You are an extremist. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2446.0s)]
*  Isn't that in some ways exactly what Donald Trump did? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2448.0s)]
*  Clear took a clear line. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2452.0s)]
*  We've had president after president say we're not going to let this stand. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2454.0s)]
*  He does it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2458.0s)]
*  And now he's the extremist. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2459.0s)]
*  I don't know. I think he's standing up for what he believes is coming. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2462.0s)]
*  Glenn, what's fascinating, watching the conservative right in the last few weeks has been fascinating for the real schism that's been developing now. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2466.0s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2476.0s)]
*  There's always been disagreement, but never quite, it seems to me, on such implacable levels as we're seeing right now, where people are really one way or the other. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2478.0s)]
*  I've never seen anything. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2487.0s)]
*  I'm friends with Ted Cruz. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2489.0s)]
*  I'm friends with Tucker Carlson. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2490.0s)]
*  I like both of them. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2492.0s)]
*  I know Donald Trump. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2493.0s)]
*  I don't know Elon Musk, but I like both of them. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2494.0s)]
*  Stop making me choose. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2497.0s)]
*  I don't think this is helpful for the Republic. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2499.0s)]
*  We can disagree on things, but to have these arguments that we're having, I mean, I'm sorry. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2502.0s)]
*  I've known Candace Owens for a long time. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2508.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened to Candace. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2510.0s)]
*  She's off on a different planet now. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2512.0s)]
*  To deny Mengele and everything else is truly horrifying. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2515.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of people that I disagree with that I can still have conversations with. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2520.0s)]
*  I think this is in many ways intentional. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2526.0s)]
*  We're all being driven to these extremes, and it's either you are this or you are that, and there's nothing in between. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2530.0s)]
*  That's not real life. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2538.0s)]
*  All life has nuance. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2540.0s)]
*  There's no way to navigate. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2542.0s)]
*  There's no way to defend ourselves, our culture, if we all have to defend ourselves. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2544.0s)]
*  If we all must be 100% this or 100% that. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2549.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2554.0s)]
*  I genuinely believe it's been fueled by social media, because what social media does, it fuels tribalism, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2555.0s)]
*  where people in the end, they become so tribal and their echo chamber keeps reinforcing this one singular worldview. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2562.0s)]
*  But when facts change, they don't want to accept it if it is negative to their tribe. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2571.0s)]
*  And it reminds me, I read a book about this several years ago, where I talked about if you go back in 2000 years, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2576.0s)]
*  you would have genuine tribes in the world, and they would be on their own, and they would dress a certain way, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2583.0s)]
*  and they would cut their hair a certain way, they would eat certain food, they would drink certain drinks, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2591.0s)]
*  they would have a language which they understood, and they would stay pretty much in their own area amongst themselves. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2596.0s)]
*  So they only ever knew one way. And then slowly but surely these tribes edged out and began to travel more, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2604.0s)]
*  and they encountered other tribes. And these other tribes looked a bit different, they sounded a bit different, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2611.0s)]
*  they maybe ate different food, they laughed at different things. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2616.0s)]
*  And these tribes concluded in that experimental moment that the only solution was to kill each other. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2620.0s)]
*  And I look at what happens on social media now, and it's pretty much the same thing, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2627.0s)]
*  where the tribes are so locked in to supporting their own side against any invader, as they put it, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2632.0s)]
*  that even when there is something which self-evidently their own side should condemn, whether it's the right or left, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2640.0s)]
*  they can't bring themselves to do it, they will fall over themselves to explain, to justify, to excuse, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2646.0s)]
*  because they feel like they're betraying their tribe. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2653.0s)]
*  So I completely agree with that, but I'd like to add one more thing. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2658.0s)]
*  I'm a recovering alcoholic, and you tell yourself lies and lies and lies and lies, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2662.0s)]
*  and you get to a point to where at some point you have to reject almost everything you are to tell the truth. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2669.0s)]
*  And it becomes, you might know, I can't keep living this way, I can't keep living this way, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2678.0s)]
*  but you have to reject everything that you have built. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2683.0s)]
*  And that's the problem with these tribes is we have separated ourselves. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2687.0s)]
*  And for me to not hate you, I have to reject almost everything that I have built in my own life, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2692.0s)]
*  because I'm built on hating you now. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2699.0s)]
*  That is a really dangerous place, and we're there. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2701.0s)]
*  And we have to recognize Western civilization, you know, beyond that. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2705.0s)]
*  You know, in the Bible, when the Jews go down into Israel, the Lord says, choose life. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2710.0s)]
*  That is the choice. It is life or death. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2716.0s)]
*  There is a culture of death through many different factions, if you will. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2720.0s)]
*  Death or life. We've got to choose life. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2726.0s)]
*  And the Western civilization has always been about life. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2730.0s)]
*  If we can't find our way to each other and say, look, I reject this death cult, we're not going to survive. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2734.0s)]
*  And if we don't survive, the world becomes a very dark place. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2742.0s)]
*  And I mean, I don't mean the United States. I mean the entire Western world. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2745.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2749.0s)]
*  And I think that this is why I found what Elon Musk calls the woke mind virus so damaging, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2751.0s)]
*  because it fueled all that stuff and often on a kind of preposterous denial of even basic biology and science. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2757.0s)]
*  And when people started trying to defend the fact that biological men were in women's sport, I was like, we've lost our minds here. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2765.0s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2772.0s)]
*  Isn't it amazing? The guy who was the biggest on the left, he was a hero for what he did for the environment, electric cars and everything else. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2774.0s)]
*  The minute he disagrees with them politically, he's dead to them. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2782.0s)]
*  And they try to destroy his business. They burn his cars. They'd like to kill him. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2787.0s)]
*  I mean, that should tell you something. You're on the wrong side when that is your reaction. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2791.0s)]
*  And also, if you're behaving exactly the same way that you profess to condemn in others, that should tell you it's time to look in the mirror and work out what you're really about. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2798.0s)]
*  What is your soul actually doing if you spend all day shrieking one thing and then you behave exactly the same way yourself? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2809.0s)]
*  Piers, I have to tell you, I think about England a lot. I pray for England a lot. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2817.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'm getting on my social media what it's really like in England, but I've seen a difference when I was in London just in three years. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2824.0s)]
*  I was there three years ago. I was just there recently. And there is a difference there. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2830.0s)]
*  And if we don't find a way to wake up, stand up and bring people to their senses calmly and rationally, all of our countries are going to fall like dominoes soon. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2834.0s)]
*  Well, the big problem I have with England is there are many great qualities of England. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2847.0s)]
*  I think it's been massively overblown. And people like Tommy Robinson and these guys, they are not people that should be taken seriously in this debate, in my estimation. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2851.0s)]
*  However, notwithstanding that, the insidious attacks on free speech in England have been really, really staggering and alarming to watch. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2860.0s)]
*  When you get people, you know, grandmothers being locked up for something they posted on Facebook and then deleting because they thought I shouldn't have done that. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2870.0s)]
*  That's not what a democratic society like the UK should be doing to anybody. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2878.0s)]
*  You know, I think that obviously we all know, we all know, I think in our gut what the exceptions to free speech are. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2884.0s)]
*  If you're literally inciting people to kill people, fine, we can all agree that is wrong. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2891.0s)]
*  Right. But when you're expressing a vehement opinion because you may be emotionally overwrought about something, which is genuinely horrific, and you're just spewing off, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2897.0s)]
*  And you then calm down and delete that, whatever, and then you're put in prison for two years. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2906.0s)]
*  I just think that is basically then you're into North Korea, Russia and everything else where any criticism of the state does that. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2911.0s)]
*  Which brings me right back to where we started. Thank you for having people I strongly disagree with. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2918.0s)]
*  I disagreed with both of those guests that you just had on. Thank you for having them on. I have to see that. We all have to see that. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2925.0s)]
*  I completely agree. We have to exercise the muscle of curiosity and intelligence and calmness while listening to people we vehemently disagree with. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2933.0s)]
*  And you know, just final point, but on the guy, the Israeli minister, the reason I was so annoyed was one of the devices used to silence legitimate debate about this is you call somebody, something ending in Iq or ist. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2944.0s)]
*  So if you said the biological men and women's sport thing was a problem, you were immediately transphobic. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2958.0s)]
*  And similarly, if you've criticized Israel's recent strategy in Gaza, which most people find pretty indefensible, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2965.0s)]
*  even if you've been someone like me that stuck his neck out to defend Israel for many, many months and their right to defend themselves, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2974.0s)]
*  even if I tried to be really fair and impartial and go after both sides where I felt they're wrong, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2981.0s)]
*  that any semblance of criticizing the Israeli government strategy meant I must be anti-Semitic and a Jew hater. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2987.0s)]
*  And I was really incensed by that. And so when he came on and tried to pretend that isn't what he was saying and that it was about one or two guests or whatever, that's not what he posted. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=2994.0s)]
*  He was doing that deliberately to try and silence me. And I find that a really insidious thing too. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3004.0s)]
*  I agree with you. I've been called the same thing. I bring up George Soros and suddenly I am an anti-Semite. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3010.0s)]
*  Candice Owens brings up the Jewish cabal and nobody's going to say anything about that. I mean, it's so ridiculous. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3017.0s)]
*  It is. Glenn, great to talk to you as always. Thank you. Come back soon. I always really enjoy our conversations. Thank you. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3026.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3033.0s)]
*  Well, now joined by a host of No Spin News on YouTube and author of new book, Confronting Evil, Bill O'Reilly. Bill, great to have you back on our census. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3036.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to get a sweater like Beck. You know, I got to get rid of this tie. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3044.0s)]
*  So, and he stands, you notice that he stands. I don't know how Beck is doing. I don't know if he's working as hard as he should work. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3049.0s)]
*  Let's unfortunately talk about more serious matters. What the hell is going on, Bill? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3058.0s)]
*  Well, what do you want to know? You want to know history? You want to know Western civilization? You want to know terrorism? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3063.0s)]
*  I mean, let me start with, let me start. Well, first of all, just a direct question. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3071.0s)]
*  Do you think Donald Trump was right to attack Iran with the bunker buster bombs? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3075.0s)]
*  Well, he did the right thing. History will unfold to see if it was the right strategy, not hedging. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3081.0s)]
*  The right thing is that if you have an enemy, and certainly Iran is America's enemy, and that enemy is saying we want to kill you, you don't get them in a position where they can kill you with a nuclear weapon. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3088.0s)]
*  It's not real complicated. And throughout history, Abilico's nations that have threatened other nations have always paid a price. So Iran is paying a price. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3103.0s)]
*  Now, the problem is that Donald Trump is not widely accepted in the world. And whatever he does brings much more scrutiny than, say, a Barack Obama. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3115.0s)]
*  But history shows that the American presidents have acted pretty much in accord to what Mr. Trump did. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3128.0s)]
*  Yeah. And certainly this idea that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tried to put out, that somehow this was unconstitutional and he'd gone without congressional approval. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3136.0s)]
*  As I quickly pointed out to her, almost every decision to order airstrikes by an American president this century, certainly, has been done without pre-approval from Congress. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3147.0s)]
*  That's because you have a 60-day window, and that window is put in there because of the alacrity of some situations. You have to take care of them. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3159.0s)]
*  You don't have to squabble publicly about whether you should get B2s out of Missouri. I mean, then the enemy knows what you're doing. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3170.0s)]
*  So look, I'm not in the business to attack people personally. I know there's a lot of people on the Internet that do that, and they make a lot of money doing it. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3179.0s)]
*  I don't do it. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is simply not smart enough to hold a position of responsibility in America. She's not. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3191.0s)]
*  Bill, as we're talking, there are reports that Iran has been attacking U.S. bases in Qatar, in Doha, and others. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3202.0s)]
*  It's still a little bit murky about what's exactly been going on. Iranian media says Iran's begun its mighty and victorious response to the U.S. strike at the weekend. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3212.0s)]
*  Quote, Iran will not leave any attack on its territorial integrity, sovereignty and national security unanswered under any circumstances. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3221.0s)]
*  Qatar is saying, as we're talking, which is Monday night, no casualties from attack on U.S. air base, but it reserves the right to respond directly and in accordance with international law. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3228.0s)]
*  There certainly have been widespread reports of explosions over Doha. So something is clearly going on here in terms of retaliation. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3240.0s)]
*  How concerned are you about the potential for this to escalate into a much wider war? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3248.0s)]
*  I'm always concerned about that. Everybody should be. But what's a choice? So the mullahs have to save face. They're tottering now. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3254.0s)]
*  If the army turns against them, they'll be overthrown. Persian people don't want them there, generally speaking. The economy's a mess. They're killers. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3263.0s)]
*  Why would you want them to lead your nation? The only reason that they have power is because Iran's a police state. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3274.0s)]
*  They'll pick you up and they'll put you in a camp or they'll kill you if you dissent against the government. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3280.0s)]
*  So they have a low level capacity to fire some missiles at U.S. air bases. The Pentagon was certainly aware that probably would happen. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3286.0s)]
*  And it's up to Donald Trump to respond. I hope he uses restraint. We could take them out, we being the United States, in what, five hours? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3297.0s)]
*  All you got to do is knock out their ports and the people will starve to death. And Trump has not done that. Could have, didn't. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3308.0s)]
*  And he's restrained Netanyahu in Israel. Trump, and I know that to be true. I have unique access to the Trump administration, as you may know. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3316.0s)]
*  Trump has been a restraining voice on Netanyahu. So there are a lot of things in play. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3325.0s)]
*  You got to figure that the mullahs are about as desperate as any human being could get at this point. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3332.0s)]
*  They could go at any time and they're trying to save face with some kind of reaction that's not going to matter much. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3338.0s)]
*  In terms of how wide this could get, Donald Trump posted on Monday a response to the former Russian president, Medvedev. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3346.0s)]
*  He said, did I hear former president Medvedev from Russia casually throwing around the N-word nuclear and saying that he and other countries would support nuclear warheads to Iran? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3358.0s)]
*  Did he really say that or was it just a figment of my imagination? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3368.0s)]
*  If he did say that, and if confirmed, please let me know immediately. The N-word should not be treated so casually. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3371.0s)]
*  I guess that's why Putin's the boss. And I read what Medvedev said. It was quite interesting on two levels. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3377.0s)]
*  One, that he was suggesting that now the fact that Iran has been developing nuclear weapons should be out in the open and discussed. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3384.0s)]
*  In other words, it was some kind of secret that we now didn't have to pretend was a secret, which I thought was quite a significant omission actually by the Russians. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3392.0s)]
*  But also just this casual threat that there are plenty of countries out there that will come along and supply Iran with nuclear weapons if necessary. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3400.0s)]
*  What do you make of that? Should we take it seriously? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3408.0s)]
*  Well, you take everything the Russians say seriously because Putin's psychotic and he threatened to use nukes in Ukraine. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3412.0s)]
*  But any country that supplies nuclear weapons to Iran is going to be a pariah, have enormous sanctions slapped on them immediately, and will probably go bankrupt. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3419.0s)]
*  So this is what the Russians do. I mean, they want to create havoc in the West. They say a whole bunch of stuff. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3430.0s)]
*  I would be very surprised if any country, including Russia, supplies the mullahs with a nuclear weapon. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3437.0s)]
*  That would be pretty much saying to the world, F you. And the world is going to reply to that. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3445.0s)]
*  What do you make, Bill, of the you've been at the forefront of conservative media in America for decades. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3452.0s)]
*  What do you make of the split in the conservative right in America now where you've got a very MAGA oriented, you know, keep out of all these foreign engagements, all these foreign wars. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3458.0s)]
*  We don't want any of this America first, America first. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3471.0s)]
*  And then you have other possibly more pragmatic members of the conservative right who recognize that occasionally you do have to get involved, whether you want to or not. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3474.0s)]
*  Where do you sit? Where do you sit? And what do you feel about the rising split as seen by the Tucker Carlson, Ted Cruz interview? [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3484.0s)]
*  I'm not a conservative. I'm a registered independent. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3493.0s)]
*  And I take positions that I believe are beneficial to the country, and I don't really care where they come from. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3497.0s)]
*  So that's my profile. That's why I've been successful for 50 years in this business. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3505.0s)]
*  If a conservative does something ridiculous and foolish, I will absolutely say that. I don't root. I report. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3511.0s)]
*  So right now, the vast majority of the American people support the bombing of Iran because Iran is an enemy. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3519.0s)]
*  You briefly mentioned my upcoming book in September, Confronting Evil. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3527.0s)]
*  Well, I told a Hamedi and Putin around to cover that book along with Adolf and Mao and then there are 12 other heinous individuals inside. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3532.0s)]
*  You're not in there, Morgan. So you missed the cut. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3540.0s)]
*  Wow. Thank you, Bill. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3544.0s)]
*  But I don't really spend a lot of time on who's fighting who. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3546.0s)]
*  Yes, it's amusing. But does it matter? No, it doesn't matter. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3552.0s)]
*  America's is most of them are smart enough to make up their own minds. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3561.0s)]
*  There's about 30 percent of Americans that are avid supporters of Donald Trump. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3564.0s)]
*  Most Americans are traditional and the Democratic Party has gone far left in this country, which is why they're getting hammered. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3571.0s)]
*  It's not so much their policies as their attitude. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3580.0s)]
*  Americans don't want trans this and they just don't want it. It's never going to happen. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3583.0s)]
*  But when you get into really who is a serious player, there are only a handful of people in the American culture that matter. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3589.0s)]
*  The movie stars don't matter. OK, the sports people don't matter. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3599.0s)]
*  I mean, they matter in their industries, but they don't matter as far as swaying public opinion. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3604.0s)]
*  That's over. That's gone. The social media destroyed all of that. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3609.0s)]
*  So nobody said gets up in the morning, said, gee, what O'Reilly says, that's what I'm going to believe. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3614.0s)]
*  They don't do that. What Americans now are searching for is fact based analysis. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3620.0s)]
*  They'd like to get the truth without all the garbage, without all the ideology, without all the hidden agendas. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3627.0s)]
*  And when you look at these nitwits calling a war parasack, you know, the worst is Senator Charles Schumer. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3633.0s)]
*  What a blank and hypocrite that guy is. And I used to like him because I'm a New Yorker. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3642.0s)]
*  When Obama bombed Libya, OK, and leading to Gaddafi's death, Schumer supported it and said nothing about it. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3649.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was the cheerleader on that. Actually, no war powers act. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3660.0s)]
*  So what's that's Libya. This is Iran, Senator. What's the deal here? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3665.0s)]
*  I can't explain it. And most Americans see through that. They see through the hypocrisy on both sides. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3671.0s)]
*  And they're rejecting it. Thank God. You like me have regular contact with Donald Trump. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3679.0s)]
*  We knew him long before he ever ran for politics. We've known him through both his 10 years now. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3687.0s)]
*  This one obviously quite early days so far. How do you feel he is second time around, Bill? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3693.0s)]
*  How do you categorize President Trump, Mark, too? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3699.0s)]
*  Much better. The first two years of his first term, he was just didn't know, trusting the wrong people. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3704.0s)]
*  He was listening to too many people. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3712.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, I've known him 35 years. He has never misled me. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3715.0s)]
*  And, you know, may I ask direct questions? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3721.0s)]
*  So he he has never misled me. And because of my association with him, I wrote a book called The United States of Trump, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3725.0s)]
*  which is widely read in the Communist Politburo in Beijing. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3733.0s)]
*  And three weeks ago, I was invited to address the communists in Beijing, which I did. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3739.0s)]
*  And it was off the record. But I told him I have to brief President Trump when I get back to the states, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3745.0s)]
*  unless you guys throw me in a gulag and I can't get back. But that wouldn't be fun. You don't want to hang with me. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3750.0s)]
*  So it was an extraordinary experience because what I brought there was a deep knowledge of President Trump. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3756.0s)]
*  And I could explain to the highest levels of the Chinese government and their questions were, well, if we do this, what will President Trump do? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3763.0s)]
*  And I could I could answer that fairly accurately without guessing. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3771.0s)]
*  But to be in that position and I didn't solicit that they came to me. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3776.0s)]
*  OK. And to be in that position where I'm a journalist, but I'm also now almost a diplomat. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3782.0s)]
*  And that wasn't the first time that happened. I was involved with the hostages and Gaza and other things. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3788.0s)]
*  And I I take it very seriously, extremely seriously. And I can't report everything. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3794.0s)]
*  So a lot of when it's off the record, I honor that. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3800.0s)]
*  But my access to the president has been a very positive experience for me and my followers, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3804.0s)]
*  because I can pass on information I know is accurate. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3811.0s)]
*  Does he always do you think tell you the truth or does sometimes he want never misled me one time in 35 years now? [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3814.0s)]
*  He doesn't tell me everything. I didn't know that on Saturday night he was going to go in and wax the Iranians. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3821.0s)]
*  I did not know that. OK, because I'm not on a phone with him every day. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3829.0s)]
*  I never call him, by the way, I don't intrude. All right. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3833.0s)]
*  If he calls me and ask my opinion, I give it to him like I did with Barack Obama and Bush the younger. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3836.0s)]
*  They both solicited my opinion as well. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3841.0s)]
*  But never has Donald Trump said one thing to me that didn't happen and or was not accurate. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3845.0s)]
*  How do you think you would like to be remembered by the end of this second term as a president? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3857.0s)]
*  As one of the greatest president, he's all over me for confronting the president. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3862.0s)]
*  The book I have out now, he's all over me on that book. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3866.0s)]
*  He goes, where am I? Where am I? Where am I in the rankings of the president? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3869.0s)]
*  And I said, yeah, it's undetermined. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3874.0s)]
*  You got three and a half years. You could screw up beyond belief. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3877.0s)]
*  You could be down there with Andrew Johnson or his cousin, Lyndon Johnson, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3880.0s)]
*  both disastrous presidents. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3885.0s)]
*  Or if the tariff thing works, if you could rework the economy so that the American people wages rise [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3888.0s)]
*  and you can impose peace upon the world, then you're going to be in the top 10. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3897.0s)]
*  So that thing is. But he wants to be on Mount Rushmore. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3903.0s)]
*  There's no more room, but he'll buy his own mount. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3909.0s)]
*  But his face up there, he will be like, right. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3912.0s)]
*  Always great to have you on our sensor. Thank you very much. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42CM3zpY3Ic&t=3916.0s)]
