Video Description: After 12 days of frenzy over World War 3, the bombs and rockets over Tehran and Tel Aviv have stopped, for now. And, under relentless pressure from Donald Trump, NATO’s members have all agreed to raise their defence spending to five per cent of GDP over the next 10 years.
However Trump’s victory lap has been interrupted by a leaked US intelligence report which says the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities did not obliterate them and may only have delayed their programme by a few months - so the President won’t be getting that Nobel Peace Prize, just yet.
Joining Piers Morgan to discuss the latest is White House Correspondent for Steve Bannon’s War Room, Natalie Winters, former IDF spokesman Doron Spielman, author and journalist for Haaretz, Gideon Levy, staff writer at The Atlantic and former speechwriter for George W. Bush, David Frum and Iranian-Swedish writer Trita Parsi.

# “Start of a LONG War!” ‘Daddy’ Trump at NATO After Israel-Iran Ceasefire
**Piers Morgan - Israel Palestine:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug)
*  I believe it was total obliteration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=0.0s)]
*  None of us knows if there was an imminent danger [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2.0s)]
*  because I don't believe necessarily to the Israeli propaganda. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=6.0s)]
*  I think Netanyahu was very disappointed that he was cut short only after a couple of days. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=10.0s)]
*  Trump realized that he did not want to walk into that trap. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=15.0s)]
*  We are very possibly at the beginning of another long war. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=18.0s)]
*  This time with goons and fools and cronies in charge of counterterrorism. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=21.0s)]
*  Trump's arrangement syndrome, patient zero. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=26.0s)]
*  I'm surprised someone whose entire career has been essentially not just lying [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=28.0s)]
*  but spreading full-blown domestic propaganda to feel so comfortable being so smug. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=32.0s)]
*  What does Hamas do best? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=37.0s)]
*  Gidon, you want to bring Hamas into the West Bank. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=39.0s)]
*  What do they do best? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=41.0s)]
*  They kill innocent Israelis and they will do it again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=42.0s)]
*  If it was 1939, Gidon, you would be making peace with Hitler. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=45.0s)]
*  I was waiting when will Hitler come into the picture. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=49.0s)]
*  It took this time more than usual because Hamas is Hitler [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=53.0s)]
*  and Khamenei is Hitler. Everyone is Hitler. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=56.0s)]
*  The bombs and rockets over Tehran and Tel Aviv have stopped for now [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=61.0s)]
*  and that almost certainly has a lot to do with this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=65.0s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=68.0s)]
*  that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=73.0s)]
*  Well, after 12 days of frenzy of a World War III and claims of an Israeli tail [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=77.0s)]
*  wagging the White House dog, Trump's declaration of a ceasefire was a mic drop moment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=81.0s)]
*  The message to Netanyahu was clear. We're partners, but I'm Batman. You're Robin. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=85.0s)]
*  President Trump is in the Netherlands today for one of the most consequential [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=90.0s)]
*  NATO summits in recent history. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=93.0s)]
*  Under relentless pressure from Trump, NATO's members have now all agreed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=95.0s)]
*  to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP over the next 10 years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=99.0s)]
*  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed Trump with a text message [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=103.0s)]
*  so flattering that he had to post the whole thing online. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=107.0s)]
*  Mr President, he wrote, Dear Donald, congratulations and thank you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=110.0s)]
*  for your decisive action in Iran. That was truly extraordinary [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=114.0s)]
*  and something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=118.0s)]
*  You are flying to another big success in behavior this morning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=122.0s)]
*  It wasn't easy, but we got them all signed on to 5%. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=125.0s)]
*  Donald, you have driven us to a really, really important moment for America [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=127.0s)]
*  and Europe and the world. You will achieve something no American president [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=130.0s)]
*  in decades could get done. Europe is going to pay in a big way, as they should [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=134.0s)]
*  and it will be your win. Safe travels and see you at his Majesty's dinner. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=138.0s)]
*  Well, again, the message is very clear. Donald is the daddy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=142.0s)]
*  They've had it. They've had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=146.0s)]
*  You know they fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=150.0s)]
*  about two or three minutes, then it's easier to stop them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=153.0s)]
*  And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to do it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=156.0s)]
*  Yeah, he has strong language. Every once in a while you have to use a certain word. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=159.0s)]
*  Well, daddy's not having it all his own way, though. Today's victory lap [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=163.0s)]
*  has been interrupted by a leaked US intelligence report which says that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=166.0s)]
*  the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities may not have obliterated them [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=169.0s)]
*  and may only have delayed their programme by a few months. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=172.0s)]
*  Mr President, what's your reaction to the intelligence reports saying [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=176.0s)]
*  that the Iranian nuclear sites were only partially devastated, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=180.0s)]
*  not entirely? Yeah, well, they said it was actually the report. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=185.0s)]
*  It could have been very... They don't know. I mean, they did a report. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=189.0s)]
*  I could have Pete talk to it because his department did the report. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=193.0s)]
*  They really don't know. I believe it was total obliteration. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=197.0s)]
*  I believe they didn't have a chance to get anything out because we acted fast. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=200.0s)]
*  If it would have taken two weeks maybe, but it's very hard to remove [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=204.0s)]
*  that kind of material. Very hard and very dangerous for them to remove it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=208.0s)]
*  Well, the reality is we don't know yet, just as we don't know if a ceasefire [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=212.0s)]
*  will hold or if Iran's stage-managed response will be its last word. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=216.0s)]
*  It's too early to give Trump his Nobel Peace Prize, although Barack Obama [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=220.0s)]
*  got one in just eight months of becoming president because he was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=224.0s)]
*  saying nice things about people. But just as it was too early to declare [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=228.0s)]
*  the end of MAGA and World War III, Trump may have to wait. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=232.0s)]
*  And if Trump is feeling bullish about Netanyahu, he could do a lot worse [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=235.0s)]
*  than denouncing the current situation in Gaza. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=238.0s)]
*  The AP says Israeli forces and drones again fired on Palestinians [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=241.0s)]
*  waiting for ages, so they're killing 44 people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=245.0s)]
*  And the US is killing 47 Israeli troops because of a Hamas car bomb. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=248.0s)]
*  It's hard to see how anybody gets a Peace Prize while that atrocious war [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=252.0s)]
*  continues. Joining me to debate all this is Natalie Winters, the White [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=256.0s)]
*  House correspondent, Steve Bannon's war room, the former IDF spokesman [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=259.0s)]
*  and author of When the Stones Speak, Major Daron Spielman, and Gideon [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=262.0s)]
*  Levy, the author and journalist for Haaretz. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=266.0s)]
*  Welcome to all of you. Natalie Winters, welcome back to Uncensored. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=269.0s)]
*  It's hard not to conclude as things stand that Trump's decisive, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=273.0s)]
*  undeniably bold action in taking these B-2 bombers over Tehran and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=278.0s)]
*  attacking the nuclear sites has been on the face of it a very successful [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=285.0s)]
*  mission, which has not led to the apocalyptic predictions that some [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=289.0s)]
*  people claimed it would lead to. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=295.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=297.0s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me back. I think it's really been a master [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=298.0s)]
*  class in brinksmanship. I think we're probably just up at the edge of that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=303.0s)]
*  I think time will tell. I think a lot of the sort of MAGA pushback to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=308.0s)]
*  getting involved in another conflict kinetically is not just contained to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=311.0s)]
*  the region, right? It's about what our other adversaries, our real threats [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=315.0s)]
*  are, whether that's the southern border, the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=318.0s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see how this impacts the peace process in Ukraine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=321.0s)]
*  I think the 12-day war is over thanks to President Trump, but I think the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=325.0s)]
*  other issue, which I hope we don't see continue to metastasize, is the sort [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=329.0s)]
*  of, I think, after the fact upselling, the sprinkling in of words like the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=333.0s)]
*  R-word, regime changer, if we see certain countries, namely Israel, I think [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=338.0s)]
*  trying to push the United States to get kinetically involved in that vertical. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=342.0s)]
*  That's something that we definitely want to abstain from, but it seems like [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=346.0s)]
*  these attacks on these three sites were successful. Even the IAEA agrees I'm [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=349.0s)]
*  not going to take some random link from some staffer over at the DIA, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=353.0s)]
*  which has a history of leaking against Pete Hegseth's DOD. So I think all [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=358.0s)]
*  said and done, major crisis averted. I think maybe the only crisis left to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=362.0s)]
*  unpack is that inside of the MAGA movement to post these strikes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=366.0s)]
*  Yeah, Gideon Levy, do you share the optimism, many a feeling, that this is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=370.0s)]
*  all done now, that the 12-day war is over, that Iran clearly blinked and has [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=375.0s)]
*  decided that it doesn't want to continue this warfare because it almost [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=381.0s)]
*  certainly can't win? Or are you sceptical about what may happen next? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=385.0s)]
*  So, dear Piers, first of all, nothing will be solved in the Middle East as [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=390.0s)]
*  long as the Palestinian problem is still boiling, as long as the massacre [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=395.0s)]
*  continues in Gaza on a daily basis. By the way, under the cover of the war [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=400.0s)]
*  with Iran, things even get worse there. Dozens of innocent people on a daily [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=405.0s)]
*  basis. So where is the room for optimism? As about Iran, which is an issue by [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=410.0s)]
*  itself, there is some place for optimism, but a very, very careful one, because [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=417.0s)]
*  none of us knows what was really achieved. None of us knows if there was an [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=424.0s)]
*  imminent danger, if there was a reason for this war at all. None of us knows it [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=429.0s)]
*  because I don't believe necessarily to the Israeli propaganda. And none of us [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=436.0s)]
*  knows what was bombed and what wasn't, what remains and what doesn't remain. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=441.0s)]
*  Without knowing this, you don't know what was achieved, what was really achieved. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=446.0s)]
*  So we have to wait, but I have to stress it again, Piers. We are dealing with the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=452.0s)]
*  margins. The main core will always be the Palestinian issue, and whatever Israel [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=458.0s)]
*  will achieve, whatever hilarious victories with all kinds of James Bond [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=464.0s)]
*  operations, finally, when we get back to reality, we have five million people [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=470.0s)]
*  under a very, very brutal occupation which cannot last forever. Enough about [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=476.0s)]
*  nine to five. What about the most important bit, the five to nine? It should [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=484.0s)]

*  Spielman, you were a former IDF spokesman. I've been exchanging quite lively [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=539.0s)]
*  posts on X with various Israeli ministers and indeed other commentators [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=545.0s)]
*  specifically about what has been going on with these very large crowds of [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=551.0s)]
*  very animated Palestinians who have been lining up for the very meager amounts [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=556.0s)]
*  of food that are available to them. I just thought it would be constructive [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=561.0s)]
*  before I ask you about that. Just to go through quickly, how many incidents [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=566.0s)]
*  there have been since the end of May specific to these lines of people who [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=571.0s)]
*  are queuing up for food, where there have been people who have been shot dead [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=576.0s)]
*  and what the IDF said about them? So 28th of May, one was killed, 48 wounded. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=580.0s)]
*  This is according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry. The UN said [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=586.0s)]
*  that most of the injuries were down to Israeli forces. The IDF said it fired [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=593.0s)]
*  at the people who were shot dead. The IDF said it fired at the people who [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=597.0s)]
*  were shot dead. The IDF said it fired at the people who were shot dead. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=602.0s)]
*  The IDF said it fired at the people who were shot dead. The IDF said it [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=606.0s)]
*  fired at the people who were shot dead. The IDF said it fired at the people [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=611.0s)]
*  who were shot dead. The IDF said it fired at the people who were shot [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=616.0s)]
*  dead. The IDF said it fired at the people who were shot dead. The IDF [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=622.0s)]
*  said troops fired at suspects, quotes, deviating from designated access [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=626.0s)]
*  routes. 7th of June, six killed, several wounded. The civil defence [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=629.0s)]
*  agencies said it was six Palestinians killed by Israeli gunfire near an [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=635.0s)]
*  aid centre. Israeli military says it fired warning shots at suspects who [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=640.0s)]
*  approached them in a threatening manner. 8th of June, four killed. Again, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=644.0s)]
*  at a group it deemed to be a threat. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=649.0s)]
*  9th June, six killed, 99 injured. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=651.08s)]
*  IDF said it was looking into the reports. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=653.84s)]
*  11th June, 57 killed, 200 plus injured. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=656.48s)]
*  The IDF said it's looking into these reports. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=660.36s)]
*  14th June, 15 killed. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=663.24s)]
*  IDF said they fired warning shots at a group [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=665.24s)]
*  they believe posed a potential threat. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=668.04s)]
*  15th June, 26 killed, 117 injured. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=670.08s)]
*  IDF said it wasn't aware of gunshots at one site [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=673.48s)]
*  and is looking into events at another. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=676.28s)]
*  16th June, 30 plus killed. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=678.48s)]
*  IDF said troops fired warning shots [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=681.2s)]
*  at suspects approaching them and posing a threat. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  17th June, 51 killed. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=685.72s)]
*  The IDF said it's looking into the reports. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  18th June, 11 killed. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=690.5200000000001s)]
*  IDF said troops fired warning shots [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=692.84s)]
*  after a group approached them in a way that posed a potential threat. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=694.9200000000001s)]
*  19th June, at least 12 killed, 60 injured. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=697.8800000000001s)]
*  IDF said suspects had attempted to approach forces [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  and soldiers had fired warning shots. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=704.8800000000001s)]
*  20th June, 23 killed, 100 injured. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=707.0799999999999s)]
*  IDF said troops fired warning shots after people gathered nearby. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=710.56s)]
*  An Israeli aircraft then struck several suspects [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=714.88s)]
*  who continued walking towards troops. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=717.7199999999999s)]
*  21st June, 8 killed. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=719.8s)]
*  IDF said it's looking into the incidents. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=721.56s)]
*  24th June, at least 44 killed, dozens injured. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=723.56s)]
*  IDF says it will review details of the reports. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=727.0s)]
*  Total number of deaths listed above 352. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=730.48s)]
*  The UN says the number is actually higher at 410. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=733.76s)]
*  But you can see the pattern there. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  The reason I read them all out so specifically, Major Spielman, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=738.0400000000001s)]
*  is you can see a pattern there [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=741.6400000000001s)]
*  where an incredibly large number of civilians are getting killed [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  in these lines of people queuing up for food. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=748.36s)]
*  And in every case, the IDF either says they fired warning shots [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=751.7600000000001s)]
*  but don't take any accountability for hitting anybody [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=756.32s)]
*  or killing or wounding anybody, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=759.24s)]
*  or they say, we're looking into the reports [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=760.9200000000001s)]
*  and then strangely, we never get any further information. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=763.16s)]
*  And at the same time, as I keep going on about, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=767.28s)]
*  the IDF won't allow international journalists [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=770.24s)]
*  into Gaza at all unless it's in tightly controlled, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=772.36s)]
*  very brief periods under their very tight control. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  So you put it all together and pertaining to what [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=779.4s)]
*  Gideon Levy just said, there has been a series [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=783.8s)]
*  of appalling things happening. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=787.28s)]
*  Well, we've had our focus taken to what's going on with Iran. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=789.8s)]
*  And I'm just not buying this argument from Israeli ministers [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=793.48s)]
*  that somehow none of this has anything to do with the IDF. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=798.04s)]
*  Are you? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=801.92s)]
*  Pierce, I think once again, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=805.88s)]
*  we're going back to the situation in Gaza, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=807.8s)]
*  which we know there's one problem in Gaza [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=810.4399999999999s)]
*  and that problem would solve all of this [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=812.6s)]
*  beyond all the numbers. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=814.76s)]
*  The problem is very simply what started this entire mess, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=815.76s)]
*  which is Hamas. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=818.5999999999999s)]
*  We know that Hamas, as we've discussed numerous times, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=820.0s)]
*  is hiding behind these civilians. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=822.8399999999999s)]
*  We know because Gazans have been posting on it, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=824.68s)]
*  including the Shirin family. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=827.4799999999999s)]
*  Gazans are filling Facebook, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=829.16s)]
*  trying to get the word out to us [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=830.7199999999999s)]
*  that they have reported that five members of their family, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=832.4s)]
*  Osama Shaheen, again and again, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=835.8s)]
*  people are being killed by Hamas on their way [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  to those food distribution points for one simple reason. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=840.76s)]
*  Hamas wants to control the food in Gaza [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=844.0799999999999s)]
*  and anyone that takes that food [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=847.56s)]
*  is possibly complicit according to them [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=849.68s)]
*  in partnering with the Israeli army. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=852.92s)]
*  It's their voices we need to listen to. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=854.48s)]
*  Regarding these numbers, I've looked online. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=856.36s)]
*  The IDF has looked online. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=858.1999999999999s)]
*  AP quotes in New York Times, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=859.84s)]
*  it quotes the AP, that quotes somebody else. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  There's not a single picture, not a single video, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=863.56s)]
*  not a single ratified source. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=866.16s)]
*  The IDF is not out there just shooting randomly at people. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=867.84s)]
*  We are trying to protect the health workers [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=871.04s)]
*  that are handing out the food, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  which by the way have given out 40 million meals [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  over the last few weeks, but the problem here is essential. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=878.36s)]
*  The problem is Hamas, as long as they are in Gaza, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=881.1600000000001s)]
*  this is going to continue because they use humans as shields. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=884.0400000000001s)]
*  The moment they leave Gaza, then this is all over. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=886.48s)]
*  It's what we've been saying since the very beginning. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  Pierce. Right, but just to be clear, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=891.36s)]
*  of all of those incidents I laid out in detail, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=893.6s)]
*  is your position really that the IDF didn't kill anybody? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=897.12s)]
*  Again, I'm not at every single incident. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=901.84s)]
*  I would assume if the IDF killed somebody [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=904.44s)]
*  or targeted somebody, we try to release that information [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=907.72s)]
*  as best we can to the press. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=910.0s)]
*  There's probably never been an army [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=911.2s)]
*  in the most difficult situation. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry to jump in. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=914.5200000000001s)]
*  I've been fighting Pierce in the entire world. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=915.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, let's have to face this before. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=918.12s)]
*  With great respect, you and I both, though, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=920.9200000000001s)]
*  that's complete claptrap. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=923.12s)]
*  The IDF will do whatever it can not to admit [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=925.1600000000001s)]
*  that it's killing civilians. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=928.1600000000001s)]
*  It constantly deflects. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  It constantly blames Hamas for all the deaths. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=931.5600000000001s)]
*  I have doctors, independent British doctors, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  who have been treating the victims, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=937.5999999999999s)]
*  who all have been saying that actually most of these deaths [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  and injuries have been caused by IDF. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=943.1199999999999s)]
*  IDF admit they keep firing bullets, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=945.92s)]
*  either they're the worst shots in the world, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=948.5999999999999s)]
*  or we're supposed to believe they're firing them [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=950.8s)]
*  all straight up in the air, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=952.1199999999999s)]
*  or they are shooting at groups of people, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=953.5999999999999s)]
*  perhaps believing they include Hamas, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=956.3599999999999s)]
*  and they're killing people on a daily basis, it seems, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=958.52s)]
*  and they're killing a lot of people. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=961.52s)]
*  And I just think this idea that the IDF [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=963.32s)]
*  can just constantly obfuscate and just say, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  we're launching a review, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=969.12s)]
*  which then never comes to anything, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=970.1600000000001s)]
*  or we just shot bullets in the air, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=971.76s)]
*  and all these people fell over [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=974.12s)]
*  and had to be treated or died. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=975.48s)]
*  It's for the birds. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=977.76s)]
*  People are just not believing it anymore. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=978.6800000000001s)]
*  And the reason I don't believe it [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=980.4000000000001s)]
*  is that the very simple way to verify it [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=982.2s)]
*  is to let the journalists in from outside into Gaza, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=984.36s)]
*  and the IDF persistently refuses, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=987.48s)]
*  at Netanyahu's instruction, to let any journalists in. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=990.1999999999999s)]
*  So there's no way to independently verify this. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=994.0799999999999s)]
*  We then rely on Palestinian journalists, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  many of whom have been killed, nearly 200 now, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=999.04s)]
*  or we rely on doctors who paint a very different story [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1001.76s)]
*  to the one you've just painted. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1005.4s)]
*  But at what point are you gonna let journalists in? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1007.28s)]
*  I'm not saying you personally, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1009.8399999999999s)]
*  but what point is the Israeli government [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1011.0799999999999s)]
*  going to let journalists in [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1012.92s)]
*  so that these things can be properly verified? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1014.3199999999999s)]
*  Pierce, I'm sorry. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  The numbers, I disagree with you completely [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1018.04s)]
*  on much of what you're saying. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1020.1999999999999s)]
*  The numbers are coming, as you and I both know, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1021.8s)]
*  from the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1024.2s)]
*  They say numbers, 5,000 were killed, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1025.3999999999999s)]
*  and everybody writes down 5,000 were killed, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1027.72s)]
*  and then they reverse their own numbers [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1029.52s)]
*  like they did between March 5th and March 7th, 2024. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1031.52s)]
*  You and I both know that the numbers of children [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1034.76s)]
*  who they reported were killed on March 5th for 14,500. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1037.6s)]
*  Two days later, those numbers went down to 7,500, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1041.6799999999998s)]
*  meaning 7,000 children... [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1046.24s)]
*  Well, how many children have been killed? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1047.56s)]
*  ..that they claimed were killed came back to life this week. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1048.72s)]
*  How many children have been killed? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1051.16s)]
*  They are in Gaza, and they are reporting these deaths, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1052.52s)]
*  and they are changing their own numbers. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1055.64s)]
*  Sure, but two things. They've been saying for years... [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1058.0s)]
*  Two things, Major Spielman. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1059.68s)]
*  If I could just finish one quick thing, Pierce, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1060.92s)]
*  can I just say one quick thing? Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1063.52s)]
*  ..that we know from this year, just a couple months ago, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1064.84s)]
*  in March of this year, 2025, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1067.72s)]
*  all of a sudden Hamas erased names off their list, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  which, when you take those names into account, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1073.08s)]
*  it shows 72% of the people that have been killed in Gaza [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1075.04s)]
*  are 13- to 54-year-old Muslims [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1079.04s)]
*  that are militant age in Gaza. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1083.6399999999999s)]
*  This is a completely different picture [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1086.44s)]
*  that they've been presenting. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1088.36s)]
*  And we know, unfortunately, 13-year-olds and 14-year-olds [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1089.6s)]
*  in Gaza are given an AK-47 and sent into the battlefield. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1091.84s)]
*  OK, two things I want to say. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1095.32s)]
*  The numbers in here is completely, completely wrong. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1096.6399999999999s)]
*  All right, two things I would point out. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1098.32s)]
*  Of course, people have died. That's why we don't want war. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1099.52s)]
*  We don't want war. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1101.36s)]
*  I would point out several things, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1102.48s)]
*  because I saw Gideon there shaking his head, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1103.8s)]
*  and I will come to you, Gideon, for a response. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1105.8s)]
*  But, first of all, you did let journalists into Gaza [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1107.48s)]
*  in previous flare-ups in Gaza without any problem, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1111.16s)]
*  so it's inexplicable that you won't let them in now. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1114.88s)]
*  Secondly, the Palestinian health authority, Hamas-run, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1119.0s)]
*  has historically revealed figures which have later turned out, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1122.5600000000002s)]
*  verified by Israel, to be broadly correct. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1126.3600000000001s)]
*  So you can dismiss all their numbers as being nonsense, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1130.1200000000001s)]
*  but actually, the truth is, historically, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1134.52s)]
*  when they have said casualty numbers, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1137.0s)]
*  they have largely turned out, and I'm not talking about this war, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1139.04s)]
*  I'm talking about historically in the last two decades, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1142.04s)]
*  they've turned out largely to be accurate, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  verified by the Israeli side, too. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1147.08s)]
*  So this idea of just making them all up is not true. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1149.4399999999998s)]
*  But let me come to Gideon, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  because you wanted to jump in there, Gideon. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1154.08s)]
*  My problem with this is that the IDF can basically just say [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1156.8s)]
*  whatever they want to dismiss any suggestion [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1161.8s)]
*  they've behaved improperly, and there's no way to disprove it, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1165.68s)]
*  because the journalists aren't allowed in there. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  No, there are so many ways to disprove it, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1172.6s)]
*  because there are so many videos coming out of Gaza, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1175.04s)]
*  and very brave journalists who are still alive, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1178.48s)]
*  who were not killed by the Israeli soldiers, still report, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  and you see the picture. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1185.48s)]
*  First of all, I must remind ourselves [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1187.08s)]
*  that when the UN agencies distributed the aid, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1189.8s)]
*  there were no killed people. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1194.44s)]
*  It all started with this monster organisation [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1196.0s)]
*  of putting two, three stations in the Gaza Strip [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1200.12s)]
*  for two million people, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1204.08s)]
*  almost as an experiment in human beings, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1206.08s)]
*  in starving human beings. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1209.12s)]
*  And then comes the question really about the figures. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1211.56s)]
*  Oh, those propaganda people, they love to speak about figures. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1215.36s)]
*  Aren't they 1,000 babies less than one year killed? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1220.4399999999998s)]
*  No, they know it's only 700 babies killed. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1225.2s)]
*  Hamas is exaggerating. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  And if it is 700 babies killed, can we live with it? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1230.76s)]
*  None of them was killed in purpose? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1235.6799999999998s)]
*  All of them by chance? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1238.28s)]
*  All of them potential threat to the soldiers? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1240.0s)]
*  How dare you to spread this propaganda [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1243.36s)]
*  knowing that you are lying? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1246.96s)]
*  There is a daily massacre in Gaza now. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1248.9199999999998s)]
*  Killing in the sake of killing, nothing but this. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1252.36s)]
*  The last two weeks are horrible because you see the soldiers, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1255.8799999999999s)]
*  you hear the machine guns, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1260.8799999999999s)]
*  you see the people lying on the sand and trying to save themselves. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1262.56s)]
*  How can you dare to invent all kinds of statistics [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1266.48s)]
*  instead of saying, yes, this is our army, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1270.24s)]
*  the army got a command now to kill as many Palestinians as possible [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1273.76s)]
*  because that's our goal now. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1278.6000000000001s)]
*  We don't have any other goal in Gaza now. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1280.16s)]
*  Natalie... [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1283.28s)]
*  Piers, can I respond to him? OK. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1284.52s)]
*  Well, let me get Natalie first, then I'll come back to you. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1286.44s)]
*  Natalie, this seems to me... [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1289.4s)]
*  This is why this is such a complex story generally, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1291.48s)]
*  because I broadly agreed with Israel and its strikes on Iran. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1294.4s)]
*  I agreed completely with the Hezbollah attacks using the pages. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1299.56s)]
*  I thought it was a brilliantly sophisticated operation [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1303.6399999999999s)]
*  against a bunch of terrorists who have been attacking Israel for years. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1305.6399999999999s)]
*  There are lots of things that Israel has been doing [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1309.44s)]
*  which I have no problem with. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1312.12s)]
*  But this situation in Gaza is being conducted [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1314.2s)]
*  in a completely different manner. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1317.12s)]
*  There's nothing surgical about it, nothing precise. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1319.24s)]
*  It just seems to be an intent to demolish Gaza, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1321.8799999999999s)]
*  to drive, according to the Finance Minister Smodrich, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1325.8s)]
*  on the record, to cleanse Gaza of Palestinians. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1328.48s)]
*  In other words, get them out. That is ethnic cleansing. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1332.16s)]
*  That would be a war crime if that happens. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1334.3600000000001s)]
*  It just seems to me that Israel... [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1337.56s)]
*  This big picture of the Israel-Palestine conflict, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1339.4s)]
*  if Israel genuinely wants to forge relations with Saudi Arabia [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1343.3600000000001s)]
*  like it's done with other nations in the Middle East, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1346.0800000000002s)]
*  it's never going to happen until they sort out what is happening in Gaza. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1349.28s)]
*  And I don't understand the strategy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1353.3200000000002s)]
*  The hostages aren't being released. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1354.96s)]
*  More and more civilians are being killed, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1357.12s)]
*  making more and more people hate the Israeli government [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1358.8s)]
*  and therefore, unfortunately, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1361.36s)]
*  Israeli people get dragged into what their government's doing on their behalf. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1363.32s)]
*  It makes the world dangerous for Israelis, for Jews. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1367.6799999999998s)]
*  I just don't see what they're doing there, which is making any real sense. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1371.52s)]
*  Do you? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1375.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think through the fog of war, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1378.96s)]
*  with what you're seeing going on in Gaza, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1381.76s)]
*  I think we're already seeing the ramifications here in the United States. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1383.6399999999999s)]
*  I think people certainly remember the really radical Hamas protests [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1386.48s)]
*  that we saw across college campuses, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1389.88s)]
*  the people who were perhaps rightfully upset about what was going on in Gaza. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1392.44s)]
*  I think you've seen really the rhetoric. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1397.16s)]
*  I think the universities, they've really become the new flashpoint for that. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1399.96s)]
*  But I think what it goes back to, right, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1404.16s)]
*  when you talk about the MAGA movement, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  sort of their reorientation of global affairs, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1408.32s)]
*  I'm not saying I don't care about what's going on in Gaza. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1411.3600000000001s)]
*  That's not at all what I'm saying. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1413.64s)]
*  But I think it's about priorities. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1415.32s)]
*  And certainly there's a sect of Americans [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1417.32s)]
*  who are really, really animated about that issue. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1419.24s)]
*  But I think Americans care more about the American lives being lost, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1421.68s)]
*  whether it's because of fentanyl, the open border, frankly, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1425.44s)]
*  the Hamas proxies, the Iranian proxies that are going on here. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1428.36s)]
*  And most importantly, I think the potential for a mass refugee conflict, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1431.48s)]
*  not just into Europe, but into the United States. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1436.12s)]
*  So I obviously have empathy and compassion. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1438.52s)]
*  And I think that to some extent, those numbers probably are accurate. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1440.6399999999999s)]
*  It's also war if you invade a country. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1444.24s)]
*  Sorry, it's also sort of what's going to happen. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1446.44s)]
*  I don't think the United States should be involved at the rate at which we're at. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1448.8400000000001s)]
*  But my primary concern as an American is that I don't want to see really [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1451.92s)]
*  what will become a snowballing number of refugees end up in the West [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1456.44s)]
*  or the United States. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1460.1200000000001s)]
*  OK, let's just bring in another guest briefly [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1461.56s)]
*  and speak to the author of political commentator, Trita Parsi. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1463.8400000000001s)]
*  Mr Parsi, thank you very much indeed for joining me. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1466.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1469.0800000000002s)]
*  There are mixed reports about just how much damage [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1470.04s)]
*  has been done to Iran's nuclear programme. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1472.84s)]
*  But Iran itself has come out and countered the early reports [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1475.24s)]
*  from US intelligence and said a significant amount of damage has been done. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1480.24s)]
*  What is your belief about what has actually gone on here [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1485.6399999999999s)]
*  and how much damage has been done? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1489.8799999999999s)]
*  I do think that a degree of damage clearly has been done. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1492.56s)]
*  And I think what we have to be careful about is not to confuse [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1497.1999999999998s)]
*  practical military success with strategic success. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1500.84s)]
*  There's still no indication that the stockpile has been destroyed. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  And the stockpile of 60 percent enriched uranium is essentially [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1508.28s)]
*  the main leverage the Iranians have. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1512.0s)]
*  That's the crown jewel of their programme right now. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1513.8799999999999s)]
*  As long as that is still intact, we cannot really say that the programme [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  has been significantly been pushed back. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1521.24s)]
*  However, there's also a self-fulfilling prophecy here in the manner in which [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1524.08s)]
*  the Israelis have managed to push Trump into military action [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  because now they're coming back and telling him, well, this is not finished. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1533.32s)]
*  You have to do more. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1537.32s)]
*  And even if he does more, there is very little reason to believe [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1538.6399999999999s)]
*  that it could completely be destroyed simply through military action. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1542.12s)]
*  And that then leaves diplomacy as the only option. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1545.1999999999998s)]
*  But once you have bombed the country, that country is going to be much more [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1548.52s)]
*  inclined to actually build a nuclear deterrence, which then the argument [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1552.1999999999998s)]
*  will be you can't trust them at this point because they clearly want to [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1556.52s)]
*  get a bomb after getting bombed. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1559.0800000000002s)]
*  That's why not entering into this cycle would have been a much better [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1561.1200000000001s)]
*  approach to avoid Iran having nuclear weapons and actually having [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1566.24s)]
*  a more clear path towards a diplomatic solution. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1570.48s)]
*  And yet there is Iran. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1573.8000000000002s)]
*  It's been directly attacked by not just Israel, who had complete control [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1575.2800000000002s)]
*  for a number of days over Tehran's airspace, but then you had the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1581.72s)]
*  Americans attacking with their B-2 bombers, launching the biggest [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1584.92s)]
*  bombs in the world on these nuclear sites with impunity. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1588.4s)]
*  Lots of rhetoric coming out of the Iranian regime about revenge [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1592.8000000000002s)]
*  and retaliation and so on. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1597.3600000000001s)]
*  And here they are after 12 days opting for peace, for a ceasefire, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1598.88s)]
*  leading most people to suspect that the long-held suspicion that Iran's [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1605.4s)]
*  military could not cope with a direct attack like this may well have [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1611.8s)]
*  turned out to be proven in the sense that why would you want to ceasefire [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1615.52s)]
*  so early when you're trying to show your people that you're a massive, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1619.24s)]
*  strong, powerful nation that won't take this kind of treatment and will [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1624.0s)]
*  respond very aggressively? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1628.72s)]
*  They haven't done that at all. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1630.44s)]
*  Actually, you're missing one important part of the picture, which is [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1632.92s)]
*  actually two parts. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1636.88s)]
*  The first part is they struck back at Israel very, very hard. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1638.08s)]
*  And we saw that despite Israel having state-of-the-art air defence [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1641.8400000000001s)]
*  systems, they did not manage to take down all of the Iranian missiles, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1646.48s)]
*  and a very large number of them actually went through. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1650.3600000000001s)]
*  It wasn't a very large number. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1652.76s)]
*  It was a relatively small number of missiles got through. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1655.44s)]
*  They did lead to some loss of life, which again, any civilian life on [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1657.76s)]
*  either side is appalling. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1661.4s)]
*  But it wasn't a lot. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1663.88s)]
*  And it's now stopped. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1665.76s)]
*  Most of the missiles were stopped by the Iron Dome. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1668.44s)]
*  So it just seemed to me... [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1671.68s)]
*  Hang on, hang on, I'll just finish my sentence. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1673.4s)]
*  Then we had this sort of fast of the attacks on the base in Qatar, where [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1677.0s)]
*  everyone apparently got warnings it was going to happen and when it was [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1682.44s)]
*  going to happen, which seemed to me just complete showpony, pointless stuff. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1685.16s)]
*  So putting it all together, I'm looking at it again, well, does Iran have [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1689.68s)]
*  the capability to match the rhetoric or have we just seen evidence that it [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1694.0s)]
*  doesn't? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1698.1200000000001s)]
*  So let me complete the picture, though, because what you're pointing to [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1699.7600000000002s)]
*  is not false. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1702.6000000000001s)]
*  I agree with it, but there's more to the picture. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1703.6000000000001s)]
*  First of all, when it comes to them hitting the Israelis, what you are [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1705.8400000000001s)]
*  allowed to see is the things that the Israelis permit to be shown, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1709.2s)]
*  except for a couple of videos, and you have probably reported as well [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1713.72s)]
*  that some people have been arrested for posting those videos. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1716.5200000000002s)]
*  The military censorship in Israel does not allow any reporting on all [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1719.2s)]
*  the military sites that have been hit. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1722.8s)]
*  So as a result, the statistics are being thrown out or that the images you [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1725.6s)]
*  see does not account for that. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1728.92s)]
*  And based on what I'm hearing from the US side, it does not correspond with [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1730.48s)]
*  your picture of this not having been successful. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1734.36s)]
*  In fact, look at what Trump said earlier today about how hard the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1736.68s)]
*  Israelis were hit. So that's one part of the picture. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1739.64s)]
*  The part of the picture, which I think you are quite correct in, is that [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1742.0s)]
*  clearly when it comes to the strike on the base in Doha, the Iranians [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1745.0s)]
*  signaled it very clearly. It was choreographed. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1750.28s)]
*  It was theatrics, as well as the American strike on Fordow, in which the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1752.56s)]
*  Trump administration made clear that the Iranians knew that it was coming to [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1756.6s)]
*  avoid any casualties precisely because of a very simple fact. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1759.92s)]
*  Between these three countries, two of them do not want to see escalation. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1763.96s)]
*  One of them is the United States. The other one is Iran. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1768.52s)]
*  The Israelis is a different matter. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1771.84s)]
*  They have worked 20 years to get the United States into war with Iran. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1773.28s)]
*  They finally succeeded. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1777.56s)]
*  And I think Netanyahu is very disappointed that it was cut short [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1779.12s)]
*  only after a couple of days. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1782.1599999999999s)]
*  He would have liked this to go on for much longer to get the United States [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1784.12s)]
*  to bomb far more places in Iran, not just nuclear, but missile facilities, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1786.6799999999998s)]
*  conventional military in order to restore a balance, an artificial [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1791.4399999999998s)]
*  balance in the region that is much more beneficial to the Israelis. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1794.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump realized that he did not want to walk into that trap. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1798.08s)]
*  The Iranians do not want to have a direct confrontation with the United States. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1801.1599999999999s)]
*  They know that they cannot win that fight, despite whatever their [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1805.12s)]
*  rhetoric is. But what they did vis-à-vis Israel, I think, is a different story. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1808.56s)]
*  Just finally, this issue of regime change, I felt when Trump first [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1813.72s)]
*  mentioned that, that he was not meaning it the way it was interpreted [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1817.9199999999998s)]
*  by a lot of people. I do not think he was talking about the United States [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1821.48s)]
*  trying to affect regime change. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1824.96s)]
*  He was talking about a more organic form of regime change of the kind we [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1827.76s)]
*  saw happen very rapidly in the end in Syria, for example, in December, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1831.3999999999999s)]
*  where the Assad regime was toppled in a matter of two or three weeks. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1835.76s)]
*  Could this happen in Iran? I mean, it is not like this regime is popular. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1841.44s)]
*  A lot of young people, now a young population, seeing how the rest of the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1846.0s)]
*  world is going, seeing a number of Middle Eastern countries normalizing [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1849.84s)]
*  relations with Israel, having much more open societies now. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1853.16s)]
*  Could you see a scenario where this Iranian regime follows the path of the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1859.04s)]
*  Assad regime? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1864.68s)]
*  Let me just make one point on a minor point that you made in your question. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1867.2s)]
*  I do not think there are any countries in the region that are jealous of the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1870.8400000000001s)]
*  ones that normalize relations with Israel, particularly mindful of the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1873.72s)]
*  genocide that the Israelis are conducting right now. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1876.52s)]
*  But having said that, you are absolutely correct. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1879.68s)]
*  The regime in Iran is extremely unpopular, and the population, I am sure, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1881.96s)]
*  the overwhelming majority would like to see a different regime. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1885.8400000000001s)]
*  One thing that I think is important to understand, though, at some point, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1889.72s)]
*  this regime is going to collapse. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1892.84s)]
*  But if it collapses in the context of war, it is far more likely that the next [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1894.6s)]
*  regime will come from within this same regime. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1900.44s)]
*  It will be more hardline elements from within this regime that will take over [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1903.28s)]
*  in the context of war than it will be some peaceful NGOs and peace activists [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1907.28s)]
*  that will be able to take over. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1911.3999999999999s)]
*  That could definitely happen, hopefully will happen at one point, but it can [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1912.76s)]
*  only happen in the context of peace. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1916.72s)]
*  But in the context of war, it is going to be the forces that have access to [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1918.84s)]
*  the two weapons and who can use force that will most likely win out if the [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1923.48s)]
*  regime collapses right now. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1928.08s)]
*  And I think that's part of the reason Trump and I agree with you, he has [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1929.44s)]
*  shown no interest in having the US be involved in regime change. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1934.0s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing because every time the US has done it, it has [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1936.8s)]
*  backfired, particularly in the Middle East. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1939.6s)]
*  He would love to see it if it comes from Iran itself, but he's also worried about [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1941.56s)]
*  exactly what would come and replace it in a context like this is part of the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1945.52s)]
*  reason I think he said that it could be 2D stabilised. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1948.76s)]
*  Trinipazi, thank you very much for coming on, I appreciate it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1952.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1954.8s)]
*  Let's go back to the panel. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1956.4s)]
*  Major Spielman, you wanted to respond before we broke off there to what [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1957.76s)]
*  Gideon Levy said. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1962.24s)]
*  You were putting on a lot of faces while he was talking, so what did you [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1963.48s)]
*  want to say? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1966.32s)]
*  First of all, Gideon is simply telling lies to this entire crowd and we've [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  seen it with our own eyes. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1972.8799999999999s)]
*  We've seen the Gazan people as they were lining up to get the food that Hamas had [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1973.92s)]
*  stolen from all the international agencies, that they were killed at point [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1978.8000000000002s)]
*  blank range because Hamas stole all those goods and they were selling them on the [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1982.28s)]
*  black market at extortion of prices. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1986.72s)]
*  And if you tried taking it when you weren't in the black market, you were [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1988.6000000000001s)]
*  killed. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  Israel and the United States did not want to put on a secondary mechanism there. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1992.3600000000001s)]
*  The fact is for 20 months, the United Nations, which many of them were complicit [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=1996.0s)]
*  in October 7th, refused or could not manage to control Hamas. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2001.44s)]
*  He's simply spreading lies directly in front of everybody's face here. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2006.1200000000001s)]
*  Go online and check it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2010.04s)]
*  But I also want to respond right now to what we just heard about Iran. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2011.04s)]
*  From what I'm hearing from your previous guest, Iran is like a normalized country [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2014.2s)]
*  that has, you know, good feelings, the regime's a little bit off. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2017.92s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2021.68s)]
*  This is Iran that had been racing towards a bomb, that had been enriching uranium, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2022.68s)]
*  that since the revolution had been calling the United States the big Satan, that [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2027.16s)]
*  killed 241 Marines via Hezbollah in Lebanon, that just targeted U.S. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2031.72s)]
*  assets and that have been claiming have a countdown clock for the destruction of [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2037.4s)]
*  Israel. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2041.48s)]
*  They are the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2042.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think that we need to step back here and realize that we're looking at is [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2044.44s)]
*  probably since World War Two, there has never been a more justified or successful [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2048.48s)]
*  military mission that when Israel just carried out against the terror regime, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2054.16s)]
*  but that's my point. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2058.16s)]
*  There's one reason. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2058.92s)]
*  So look, we're not looking for an explanation, Pierce. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2059.64s)]
*  All right, but because there's a gun to our head and a time bomb ticking. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2061.72s)]
*  But you just hit on the point I made earlier, which is I agree about the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2065.04s)]
*  operation in Iran. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2069.16s)]
*  I agree about the operation against Hezbollah. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2071.16s)]
*  The thing I find completely incomprehensible is why Israel, through its [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2074.2799999999997s)]
*  government, continues to pursue a strategy in Gaza, which is making it a [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2079.16s)]
*  global pariah. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2083.36s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2084.68s)]
*  I don't see any evidence of the hostages being released. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2085.52s)]
*  But if anything, you could say their lives are more endangered by this [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2088.36s)]
*  strategy. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2091.2799999999997s)]
*  More and more of Gaza is being completely leveled. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2092.7599999999998s)]
*  You've got members of the cabinet openly talking now about ethnic [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2095.68s)]
*  cleansing, not even trying to hide it, which I found completely horrifying. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2099.8s)]
*  And I just don't understand why Israel is so keen to be so precise and so [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2104.8799999999997s)]
*  careful and so targeted in Iran and in Lebanon against its enemies, the [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2110.0s)]
*  regime in Iran, the Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, and yet so [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2116.92s)]
*  indiscriminate in the way it's going about its business in Gaza, knowing [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2121.64s)]
*  how many civilians are getting killed. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2126.56s)]
*  And this sort of constant, every day, the idea of saying, we're doing [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2128.7599999999998s)]
*  nothing wrong. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2132.48s)]
*  It's the most moral war ever. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2133.6s)]
*  And by the way, the ratio of terrorists to civilians, there's never [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2135.04s)]
*  been anything better than this in the world in the history of urban [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2139.16s)]
*  warfare. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2141.68s)]
*  But you can't actually tell me how many civilians have been killed or [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2142.36s)]
*  how many children have been killed. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2145.56s)]
*  So how you can work out a ratio when you don't know those numbers is [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2146.96s)]
*  completely baffling to me. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2150.88s)]
*  But you add it all up and I just don't get it. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2152.48s)]
*  And for criticizing the government and for pointing this out, which a [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2154.52s)]
*  lot of people are thinking, you know, I get called an anti-Semite, a [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2159.68s)]
*  Jew hater, all these stupid things. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2163.16s)]
*  You're not an anti-Semite. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2165.0s)]
*  You're wrong about Israel in many accounts. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2165.96s)]
*  You're not an anti-Semite. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2167.56s)]
*  That was a ridiculous statement to be made. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2169.0s)]
*  But a lot of people. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2170.6s)]
*  But you're wrong about many things. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2171.6s)]
*  Right, yeah. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2173.48s)]
*  But you worked. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2174.48s)]
*  Originally, you condemned October 7th. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2175.48s)]
*  You used to condemn it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2177.24s)]
*  I still condemn it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2178.48s)]
*  And you would call everyone on the show. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2179.48s)]
*  I respected it. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2180.48s)]
*  I know you do, but you would ask everyone on the show, do you condemn [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2181.48s)]
*  it? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2183.24s)]
*  My question is, what does it mean to condemn it? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2184.24s)]
*  What are you condemning? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2185.36s)]
*  What are your guests condemning? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2186.36s)]
*  They're condemning that Israelis were killed. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2188.0s)]
*  Well, they didn't die by natural causes. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2189.52s)]
*  I know what I'm condemning. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2191.4s)]
*  Well, let me be clear. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2192.4s)]
*  Which is a terror regime. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2193.4s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2194.4s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2195.4s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2196.4s)]
*  Because I haven't changed my narrative about Hamas one iota. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2197.4s)]
*  They are a despicable terrorist group who perpetrated one of the worst [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2201.0s)]
*  terror attacks of modern times on the people of Israel. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2205.96s)]
*  They murdered over 1,200 people. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2209.6800000000003s)]
*  They kidnapped over 250 more Holocaust survivors, babies. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2212.44s)]
*  They burned people alive. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2218.04s)]
*  They chopped them into pieces. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2219.96s)]
*  They beheaded people. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2221.36s)]
*  They went to music festivals and gunned down young people in the first [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2222.84s)]
*  flush of their youth at a music festival and so on. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2226.8s)]
*  I've made no no pretence about my horror about everything to do with [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2230.04s)]
*  Hamas and the fact that they, of course, they should never have anything [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2236.04s)]
*  to do with any government in Gaza going forward. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2239.28s)]
*  I've never deviated one iota. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2243.2400000000002s)]
*  Where I've deviated is in how the Israeli government is prosecuting [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2244.84s)]
*  this war, because it's not working. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2249.2400000000002s)]
*  You're just not achieving the aims, which is an absolute... [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2251.44s)]
*  All you're doing is making Israel more and more hated. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2254.2400000000002s)]
*  We're not watching a movie here, Pierce. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2257.2400000000002s)]
*  This is not a video game. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2259.2400000000002s)]
*  What we are looking at here, the same Hamas terrorists that charged over [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2261.2400000000002s)]
*  our borders that have no regard for human life, as you and I both know, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2264.2400000000002s)]
*  they're not sitting in the open courageously battling Israeli soldiers [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2267.2400000000002s)]
*  on the open battlefield. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm sorry to repeat it again, hiding in civilian areas because that is [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2273.16s)]
*  the only thing that can protect them. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2276.16s)]
*  And therefore, the alternative, Pierce, is that we just leave them in Gaza, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2278.16s)]
*  which is exactly going to bring the next October 7th, which you are [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2282.16s)]
*  condemning and I'm condemning. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2285.16s)]
*  So if we are condemning October 7th, it means making the very difficult [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2287.16s)]
*  decision that Israel's making to fight this war to the end until Hamas is [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2290.16s)]
*  destroyed, to move their civilian population, 1.5 million people, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2295.16s)]
*  8 million people out of the way and try to eliminate a terror organisation [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2300.08s)]
*  that are holding babies in front of them while the entire world, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2304.08s)]
*  including you in many cases, say you're not going about it correctly. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2307.08s)]
*  If you have another idea of how we can destroy Hamas without killing a [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2310.08s)]
*  single civilian, please sit down. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2314.08s)]
*  I do have another idea. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2316.08s)]
*  I do have another idea. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2318.08s)]
*  I'll make a meeting between you and Prime Minister Netanyahu and it will [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2320.08s)]
*  become the Pierce plan to get everyone out of Gaza. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2323.08s)]
*  But if it doesn't work, I can't go to sleep if they're still in Gaza. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2326.08s)]
*  You do what you did the last time you got the hostages out. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2330.0s)]
*  In fact, all the hostages that have been released were released [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2333.0s)]
*  through diplomatic means. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2336.0s)]
*  They were done through diplomatic channels. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2338.0s)]
*  That's how these things get resolved. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2340.0s)]
*  Let me bring in Gideon Levy. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2342.0s)]
*  That's not how it was done. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2344.0s)]
*  Pierce, wait, there are two elements to this. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2346.0s)]
*  One is the diplomatic channel that only exists because we know that [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2348.0s)]
*  Hamas are not diplomats, they are terrorists. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2352.0s)]
*  The only reason they resort to diplomacy is because they feel like [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2354.0s)]
*  they are about to be eliminated. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2357.92s)]
*  Without the military side, the only diplomacy Hamas knows is to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2359.92s)]
*  commit terrorism and call for the destruction of the state of Israel. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2362.92s)]
*  It's not diplomacy. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2365.92s)]
*  It's diplomacy under military pressure. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2367.92s)]
*  Let me bring Gideon in. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2369.92s)]
*  Gideon, the argument from Major Spielman, former IDS spokesman, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2371.92s)]
*  is there is simply no other way to prosecute this war in Gaza than [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2374.92s)]
*  the way they are currently doing, which, as I say, is killing more [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2377.92s)]
*  and more civilians and is making Israel more and more of a global [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2380.92s)]
*  pariah. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2383.92s)]
*  To me, that is a catastrophic error of judgment by the Israeli [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2386.84s)]
*  government right up there with Netanyahu years ago deciding it was [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2389.84s)]
*  a good idea to give Hamas billions of dollars and to try and set up a [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2394.84s)]
*  divide and rule between them and the Palestinian authorities. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2398.84s)]
*  Netanyahu has made a lot of very bad errors here and will be held [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2401.84s)]
*  accountable for it at the end of this. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2405.84s)]
*  But in answer to that specific question, how else should Hamas be [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2407.84s)]
*  removed? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2412.84s)]
*  Hamas cannot be removed. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2415.76s)]
*  Israel is trying now for 20 months to remove Hamas, and still the [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2418.76s)]
*  Major is speaking about the terrorists who are hiding. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2423.76s)]
*  Where is the IDF if after 20 months you didn't succeed to eliminate [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2426.76s)]
*  all of them? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2431.76s)]
*  It's a small piece of land. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2432.76s)]
*  Look what you have done in Lebanon so successfully, because that's not [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2434.76s)]
*  the aim. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2438.76s)]
*  The aim is much farther than this. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2439.76s)]
*  But let me just make a few remarks about what he has just said. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2442.6800000000003s)]
*  The Hamas is hiding in civil concentrations. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2446.6800000000003s)]
*  I live in a very peaceful neighborhood in Tel Aviv surrounded [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2451.6800000000003s)]
*  by three military positions or three military offices and [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2455.6800000000003s)]
*  headquarters. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2464.6800000000003s)]
*  So what? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2465.6800000000003s)]
*  The biggest hospital in Tel Aviv is 200 meters from the headquarter of [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2467.6800000000003s)]
*  the Israeli army. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2472.6s)]
*  So who is hiding? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2473.6s)]
*  Really those cliches of the Israeli propaganda are already tiring. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2475.6s)]
*  That's the point. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2480.6s)]
*  Now above all, I would like to replace you for a moment, Piers, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2482.6s)]
*  and ask the Major, is there anything that Israel did wrong in Gaza? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2488.6s)]
*  Israel killed anyone in purpose by mistake who is innocent? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2496.52s)]
*  Weren't there hundreds of babies, newborn babies killed? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2503.52s)]
*  Is it inevitable? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2508.52s)]
*  Do you really... [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2510.52s)]
*  I mean it's an insult to speak about the Israeli army is more... [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2512.52s)]
*  I'll answer your question. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2516.52s)]
*  Of course, Gideon, I'll answer your question. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2518.52s)]
*  Just let me finish. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2520.52s)]
*  There's a war that is being fought in an insanely close quartered [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2522.44s)]
*  urban combat against a terror army with multiple troops. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2527.44s)]
*  Of course there have been mistakes made. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2530.44s)]
*  And if you look, the IDF admits mistakes. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2532.44s)]
*  We admitted mistakes that happened with the medics and it was [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2534.44s)]
*  extremely painful and it came out and we admitted it and we've [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2536.44s)]
*  admitted other mistakes and you've had commanders that have been [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2539.44s)]
*  demoted. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2542.44s)]
*  However, Gideon, I want to say something to you. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2543.44s)]
*  The fact that there have been individuals, of course there have [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2545.44s)]
*  been individuals that have made mistakes. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2548.44s)]
*  There are individuals that have made mistakes. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2551.36s)]
*  Israel as an army calls for the elimination of Hamas and I want to [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2553.36s)]
*  ask you a question. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2556.36s)]
*  You say that Hamas cannot be defeated. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2557.36s)]
*  So what I understand, Gideon, is that you want to raise a white [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2560.36s)]
*  flag, Hamas can't be defeated. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2563.36s)]
*  Since it can't be done perfectly, we should go back into Israel, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2565.36s)]
*  go back to sleep so that Hamas can regroup and do what they do [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2568.36s)]
*  best. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2571.36s)]
*  What do they do best, Gideon? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2572.36s)]
*  What does Hamas do best? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2574.36s)]
*  No. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2576.36s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2577.36s)]
*  What does Hamas do best? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2578.36s)]
*  You want to bring Hamas into the West Bank. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2581.28s)]
*  What do they do best? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2583.28s)]
*  They kill innocent Israelis and they will do it again. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2584.28s)]
*  If it was 1939, Gideon, you would be making peace with [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2587.28s)]
*  Hitler. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2590.28s)]
*  You would be giving in to Hitler's terms. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2591.28s)]
*  You don't have the courage to stand up and fight our enemies. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2593.28s)]
*  You don't have the courage to stand up and protect the [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2596.28s)]
*  Israeli people. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2598.28s)]
*  You should be ashamed to call yourself Israeli. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2599.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2601.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2602.28s)]
*  I was waiting. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2603.28s)]
*  When will Hitler come into the picture? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2604.28s)]
*  It took this time more than usual because usually the Israeli [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2606.28s)]
*  propaganda uses Hitler just in the beginning. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2610.2000000000003s)]
*  This time it's 50 minutes now until Hitler got in the picture [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2612.2000000000003s)]
*  because Hamas is Hitler and Khamenei is Hitler. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2616.2000000000003s)]
*  Everyone is Hitler. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2619.2000000000003s)]
*  And therefore we have the right to do whatever we want. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2621.2000000000003s)]
*  Khamenei is Hitler. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2623.2000000000003s)]
*  Of course that you want the way. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2624.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you not think that Hamas is similar to Hitler? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2626.2000000000003s)]
*  I would love to understand this. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2628.2000000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2630.2000000000003s)]
*  This is really denying the Holocaust. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2631.2000000000003s)]
*  To call Hamas Hitler is denying the Holocaust. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2633.2000000000003s)]
*  Shame on you. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2636.2000000000003s)]
*  No, I accept the Holocaust and I accept that Hitler [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2639.12s)]
*  has children. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2641.12s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar is the child of Hitler. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2643.12s)]
*  And Khamenei is the child of Hitler. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2645.12s)]
*  They all want to eliminate the Jewish people. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2648.12s)]
*  And you come from a Holocaust family. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2650.12s)]
*  And the fact that you cannot see this in the modern day [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2652.12s)]
*  and you support our enemies, your own relatives are turning [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2655.12s)]
*  in their graves. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2659.12s)]
*  You are a useful idiot for Hamas. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2660.12s)]
*  And it is painful for me to say that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2662.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2665.12s)]
*  You finished all the talking points of the Israeli [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2668.04s)]
*  propaganda, so let me tell you. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2670.04s)]
*  Hamas is not my cup of tea. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2672.04s)]
*  As a matter of fact, Hamas victims are first of all the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2674.04s)]
*  people of Gaza who hates them, most of them. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2677.04s)]
*  But Hamas cannot be replaced by force. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2680.04s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2684.04s)]
*  Hamas cannot be replaced by force because Hamas is [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2686.04s)]
*  governing there for over almost 20 years. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2689.04s)]
*  And we know that Israel has no clue who can replace Hamas. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2694.96s)]
*  No clue except of transferring all the people of Gaza. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2697.96s)]
*  We have no clue who is going to replace Hamas. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2701.96s)]
*  The Jewish Federation of New York. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2704.96s)]
*  Who exactly will replace Hamas? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2706.96s)]
*  The paralyzed, corrupted PA. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2708.96s)]
*  Who is going to replace Hamas? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2711.96s)]
*  And by the way, even the PA is not good enough for our [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2713.96s)]
*  government. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2716.96s)]
*  They want real Zionists to govern Gaza. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2717.96s)]
*  Hamas is not Zionist enough. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2720.96s)]
*  I would add to that, Gideon, again I come back to what [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2723.88s)]
*  Smodrich said. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2726.88s)]
*  The game plan for a lot of the members of that government is [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2728.88s)]
*  clear. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2731.88s)]
*  It is ethnic cleansing. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2732.88s)]
*  It is get all the Palestinians out of Gaza and for the Israelis [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2734.88s)]
*  to take over. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2737.88s)]
*  That is ethnic cleansing. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2739.88s)]
*  I will take a short break again. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2741.88s)]
*  I will come back to the panel for response to this interview with [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2743.88s)]
*  David Frum, writer at The Atlantic and former speech [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2746.88s)]
*  writer for George W Bush. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2748.88s)]
*  David, I think you will debut on Uncensored. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2751.8s)]
*  I think so. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2753.8s)]
*  Welcome to you. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2755.8s)]
*  I think I interviewed you many times at CNN many years ago. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2757.8s)]
*  Yes, that is right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2759.8s)]
*  I will start with a contentious statement. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2761.8s)]
*  As I sit here, Donald Trump has managed to end this war, it [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2763.8s)]
*  appears, in 12 days with Iran and Israel. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2766.8s)]
*  He has also got the NATO countries to pledge to 5% of their GDP [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2769.8s)]
*  spending on defence, which is a massive win for the United States [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2773.8s)]
*  . [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2777.7200000000003s)]
*  By contrast to Barack Obama who got the Nobel Peace Prize after [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2779.7200000000003s)]
*  less than eight months because he said some nice things about the [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  Muslim world and the West coming together, why should Donald Trump [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2785.7200000000003s)]
*  not now get the Nobel Peace Prize? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2788.7200000000003s)]
*  There are two truths we have to keep in mind. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2791.7200000000003s)]
*  They are kind of opposite. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2794.7200000000003s)]
*  The test of our acuity or maybe even our democratic survival is [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2796.7200000000003s)]
*  holding both of these two things together. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2799.7200000000003s)]
*  The first is that the action the president took to strike the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2803.64s)]
*  Iranian nuclear programme at a moment when thanks to Israeli [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2806.64s)]
*  ingenuity and daring it could be done, which has not been the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2809.64s)]
*  case before, that was a necessary and correct act and I [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2812.64s)]
*  salute him for it. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2815.64s)]
*  At the same time, while we hope that this war is over, it may not [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2817.64s)]
*  be, while we hope the programme is over, it may not be, and Donald [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2820.64s)]
*  Trump now becomes a more dangerous threat to American [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2823.64s)]
*  democracy because he still does not respect the due process rights [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2826.64s)]
*  of citizens of the United States. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2829.64s)]
*  He does not respect the due process rights of citizens, the [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2832.56s)]
*  free speech rights, democratic elections and basic rules about [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2835.56s)]
*  honest government and conflict of interest and not taking massive [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2838.56s)]
*  handouts from persons all over the world undisclosed to the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2841.56s)]
*  United States people. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2844.56s)]
*  You made a lot of claims there. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2846.56s)]
*  If he was sitting here listening to this, he would counter quite [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2848.56s)]
*  hard on that. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2852.56s)]
*  He would say that he pushes the envelope hard on things like, for [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2854.56s)]
*  example, the deportation programme, but that he does abide [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2857.56s)]
*  by what courts say. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2861.48s)]
*  If eventually all appeals against the courts are against him, he [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2863.48s)]
*  has said he will abide by what they say. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2868.48s)]
*  He has also said in relation to the stolen election, which I said [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2871.48s)]
*  to his face wasn't stolen and so on, the reality is he did leave [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2874.48s)]
*  the White House and he wasn't there for four years. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2877.48s)]
*  In other words, Trump will say a lot of quite inflammatory things [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2880.48s)]
*  but the reality is that the system in American democracy has [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2883.48s)]
*  actually worked pretty well. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2887.48s)]
*  Why are you so scared about him and the potential threat to [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2890.4s)]
*  democracy? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2893.4s)]
*  His attempted coup failed in 2021, that's true, because he made a [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2895.4s)]
*  mistake. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2898.4s)]
*  He thought you could overthrow an election with a disorganised [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2900.4s)]
*  mob. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2902.4s)]
*  That turned out not to be true. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2904.4s)]
*  As you say, the American state is powerful. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2906.4s)]
*  This time around, he has learned his lesson and he is federalising [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2908.4s)]
*  the military. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2911.4s)]
*  He has a military presence in the state of California without the [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2913.4s)]
*  request of the state government. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2916.4s)]
*  He is saying that he is not sure if he should respect the due process [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2919.32s)]
*  rights of American citizens. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2922.32s)]
*  He is saying that he should respect the civil rights laws in the [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2924.32s)]
*  1960s. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2927.32s)]
*  Yes, when the courts say you cannot withhold due process rights [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2929.32s)]
*  after litigating and litigating something that no previous [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2932.32s)]
*  president would ever think to try to litigate, he says yes. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2935.32s)]
*  But people around him are saying we are not sure we have to respect [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2938.32s)]
*  the due process rights. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2941.32s)]
*  He is abiding by it and we are seeing some of these decisions [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2943.32s)]
*  being made. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2947.2400000000002s)]
*  If you have a court order to bring them back, it is happening. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2949.2400000000002s)]
*  This is to borrow a phrase from the George W Bush administration, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2952.2400000000002s)]
*  which I serve, the soft bigotry of low expectations. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2955.2400000000002s)]
*  Congratulations, Mr President, that when your attempt to do [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2958.2400000000002s)]
*  something illegal, immoral, unethical, unconstitutional is [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2961.2400000000002s)]
*  struck down by three levels of appeal, you don't at that point do [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2964.2400000000002s)]
*  what you are doing in the state of California and call out the [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2967.2400000000002s)]
*  troops. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2970.2400000000002s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2972.2400000000002s)]
*  It is not something you litigate. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2975.16s)]
*  That is not true, David. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2977.16s)]
*  It is perfectly normal for American presidents to challenge the law. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=2979.16s)]

*  counterterrorism wing of the FBI and left those jobs either vacant or [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3223.24s)]

*  many of the jobs in the counterterrorism part of FBI and Homeland [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3260.16s)]

*  really do. But if it's not, you've got a president who has abused power in [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3282.3599999999997s)]
*  the past, is ready to abuse it again. His powers get bigger in wartime than [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3286.24s)]
*  they do in peacetime. And he's got a domestic security apparatus that is [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3289.48s)]
*  not equivalent to that of the job. He's got Pete Hegseth, for goodness [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3292.88s)]
*  sakes, running the Department of Defence. He doesn't seem to be doing [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3296.16s)]
*  a bad job so far, Pete Hegseth? Has he made some catastrophic mistake that [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3299.68s)]
*  I'm not aware of? Well, he posted the war plans of the United States on [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3307.48s)]
*  the slisher. They had an issue with using signal. But other than that... [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3310.96s)]
*  Has he made...? They had an issue with showing off and bragging and [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3315.8799999999997s)]
*  ignoring security laws. And by the way, it shouldn't have happened and they [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3318.64s)]
*  learned a lesson. But that was... That was obviously a dumb mistake. But [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3321.96s)]
*  in terms of an action he's taken in his job... You know what kind of person [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3328.3599999999997s)]
*  makes dumb mistakes? A dumb person. And that person... Pete Hegseth's not a [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3332.7599999999998s)]
*  dumb person. I know him well. OK. He's not? We have views. He's a smart [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3336.08s)]
*  guy. That person is in charge of this operation. That person is... And you [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3342.3599999999997s)]
*  look at the other people... Didn't he go to Harvard and Princeton from [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3347.2799999999997s)]
*  memory? I think he went to at least two of them. He served 20 years in [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3349.92s)]
*  the military. It's very funny how snobbish the MAGA people become on [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3354.0s)]
*  defence when they use anti-snobbishness as a weapon on office. I'm not MAGA. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3359.56s)]
*  Pete Hegseth's academic credentials are good for him. You called him dumb. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3365.44s)]
*  I'm just saying he went to two of the finest universities in the country. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3369.16s)]
*  He ignored security rules that everyone in his position would ignore. He [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3372.28s)]
*  made a mistake on Signal. Repeatedly. He didn't learn. And now he's in [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3375.7200000000003s)]
*  charge. And now Christie Noem is in the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3381.44s)]
*  Now Kashpal and Don Bongino are in charge of keeping Americans safe at [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3383.56s)]
*  home. And now they have left the counter-terrorism jobs vacant because [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3386.32s)]
*  they won't swear loyalty to us. Again, I really do hope... I think the [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3389.44s)]
*  president did the right thing striking for the Iranian nuclear sites. And [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3394.28s)]
*  I hope this war is brief and successful. And if the present appearances [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3398.4799999999996s)]
*  are optimistic, and I'm glad of that, but we are in a very dangerous [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3402.4799999999996s)]
*  position and this president has abused power in the past, will abuse it [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3405.6s)]
*  more. His powers get greater if there is a conflict situation. And those [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3408.9199999999996s)]
*  are the two truths we have to keep in mind. The action is right and the [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3413.8799999999997s)]
*  president is dangerous. And look, I don't really believe that in your [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3417.7999999999997s)]

*  charming. It's nothing to do with him being charming or anything. I've [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3425.8399999999997s)]

*  terrorism. So I just think that for all the hysteria about Trump, I [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3471.6400000000003s)]
*  judge a guy on what he actually does. I am quite reassured that Trump [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3475.76s)]
*  instinctively wants peace, not war, and he absolutely does not believe [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3479.72s)]

*  threats to NATO. He hasn't abandoned them yet. Hundreds of Ukrainians are [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3491.52s)]

*  information to them during a Russian operation. He has made it very [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3499.8799999999997s)]
*  clear that he is no friend to Ukraine. Ukrainian supplies are in danger. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3503.4399999999996s)]

*  do it with democratic consent. I want him to work with members of House [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3597.8799999999997s)]
*  and Senate. I agree with you. I want him to speak to the American people. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3600.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't want him to wage a war in the Middle East, as he is now doing, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3603.48s)]

*  swift and cheap result. Swift and cheap success so I don't need the [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3615.56s)]
*  country with me. As you know, David, pretty much every president who has [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3619.96s)]
*  ordered airstrikes in the last 25 years has done so without any [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3625.48s)]
*  pre-approval from Congress. No, they go to the protocol of talking to the [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3629.24s)]
*  leading members of the House of Senate. He blitzed Libya without asking [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3636.12s)]
*  anyone. If it is cheap and easy and successful, you can do a lot. But [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3640.2s)]
*  if this mission is cheap and easy and successful, and I hope it will be, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3646.28s)]
*  then none of the things I have talked about will matter. But if it is not, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3649.96s)]
*  if he has to go back to Congress for supplemental appropriation, if the [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3653.0s)]
*  Iranians find some way to strike back, if this war becomes protracted, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3655.8s)]
*  the things he didn't do and the person he isn't capable of being, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3659.32s)]
*  those are going to become expensive. So those are the two truths. What has [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3662.44s)]
*  happened so far, I salute it, I hope for the best. But if it goes wrong, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3665.72s)]
*  this is not a person who can lead the country through anything difficult [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3670.68s)]
*  because he doesn't care about consent and he can't mobilise the country. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3673.72s)]
*  OK. I don't really agree with that. But obviously, as always, the proof [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3677.3199999999997s)]
*  will be in the pudding, as we say over here. And we will see. I think we [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3681.8799999999997s)]
*  both hope for the best, as always, prepared for it not to happen. But I [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3685.16s)]
*  think I actually am encouraged by the way Trump goes about his foreign [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3689.48s)]
*  policy. Lots of issues I had. There are also things that you said which I [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3693.24s)]
*  kind of agree with. I believe passionately in due process. Some of [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3696.7599999999998s)]
*  the specific cases on the deportations, I would be very vocal about this [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3700.52s)]
*  shouldn't have happened without proper due process. I agree with you [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3704.04s)]
*  about that. But I look at the trouble with Trump is he does something like [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3706.52s)]
*  the southern border, which has been a spectacular success, reduce the [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3711.4s)]
*  number of people coming over. I heard today something like 12,000 last [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3714.7599999999998s)]
*  month came over, which was the same number that we're going over every [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3719.24s)]
*  day under Biden for four years. And you're like, at some point, even if [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3722.44s)]
*  you hate Trump, you just have to go, this has been an amazing success, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3725.88s)]
*  and applaud. You can't look at a series of dots and say, I like this [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3729.64s)]
*  group of dots over here, and I don't like these over here, but I refuse to [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3734.6s)]
*  see these dots connect into a single picture. The dots add up to something. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3738.52s)]
*  And of course, President has a lot, I like many of the things Donald Trump [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3742.6s)]
*  has done, even in the first term. Many of the things. That doesn't matter [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3745.48s)]
*  because there are points in a larger picture. So I can't say, yes, these [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3748.68s)]
*  are good points, these are bad ones, and not see the pattern that is [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3752.92s)]
*  formed of disregard for law, disregard for ethics, disregard for [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3756.52s)]
*  due process, disregard for free speech, self-enrichment on a post-Soviet [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3760.04s)]
*  or post-colonial African scale without, again, regard to law. This is [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3764.28s)]
*  a very dangerous presidency. And it does a lot of things, some of them [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3767.8s)]
*  good, and we hope for the best in Iran. We sincerely, sincerely do. But [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3771.72s)]
*  this is a dangerous situation, and it may be about to become a lot more [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3775.56s)]
*  dangerous yet. David Frum, great to have you on Uncensored. Thank you [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3778.28s)]
*  very much. Thank you. Bye-bye. Let's go back to the panel. Natalie, a lot [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3781.08s)]
*  to unpack there from David Frum. In a way, I kind of agree with him [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3786.04s)]
*  about stuff like due process and stuff, but I also got the feeling of [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3790.6s)]
*  somebody who just instinctively hates Trump, and so is very reluctant to [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3793.72s)]
*  give him much credit for anything and just constantly wants to downplay [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3798.12s)]
*  any good stuff by saying, it's all going to go to hell on a handcart [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3802.04s)]
*  anyway. I'm not convinced that that is the case. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3805.08s)]
*  Yeah, Trump Derangement Syndrome, patient zero. I'm surprised someone [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3809.96s)]
*  whose entire career has been essentially not just lying, but spreading [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3813.56s)]
*  full-blown domestic propaganda to the American people to pave the way so [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3817.64s)]
*  young Americans can die in foreign battlefields would feel so comfortable [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3821.56s)]
*  being so smug, frankly even showing his face on TV platforms, especially [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3825.7999999999997s)]
*  at this time right now. I think it was him right back in what was the [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3830.44s)]
*  early 2000s writing the National Review condemning, I guess it would be [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3834.7599999999998s)]
*  the equivalent of people like myself, like Steve Bannon, like Tucker, and [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3838.6s)]
*  more of the MAGA right for opposing the Iraq war, saying that we are [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3841.8s)]
*  unpatriotic conservatives. I think that that is projection at its finest. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3845.5600000000004s)]
*  I just love how the man who was so instrumental in lying about WMDs, he [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3850.44s)]
*  thinks there's such a wide aperture for the lies that you can frankly, I [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3854.6000000000004s)]
*  would say, you want to talk about due process, that's probably something [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3858.04s)]
*  that David Fromm and his colleagues should have had when it came to lying [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3860.6000000000004s)]
*  about Iraq and everything that happened there, but that there's such, I think, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3863.7200000000003s)]
*  a wide frame for people like him to lie about and engage in lawfare and the [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3867.4s)]
*  rhetoric and the propaganda when it comes to getting the United States [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3872.52s)]
*  involved in foreign conflicts, but any time we want to try to actually secure [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3875.2400000000002s)]
*  the homeland in a meaningful way, whether it's the southern border, not [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3878.92s)]
*  importing tens of millions of foreigners, all of a sudden his foremost [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3882.04s)]
*  priority is protecting the Geneva Convention-derived rights of gang [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3885.8s)]
*  banging criminals like Kilmar Garcia. It's absolutely absurd, and it's [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3890.12s)]
*  people like him, when I watch him do interviews, I'm so glad that he is no [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3895.48s)]
*  longer a part of the Republican Party, that we're going in a MAGA direction, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3899.56s)]
*  and I think that that interview, that TDS that you saw on full display, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3902.84s)]
*  should be a warning to President Trump and people in the MAGA movement who [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3906.44s)]
*  want to play footsie and try to cater to people like Mark Levin and David [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3910.04s)]
*  Fromm, who maybe are a little pro the Iran strikes. They will never give [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3913.32s)]
*  President Trump the support, or frankly, I think that he deserves the MAGA [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3917.16s)]
*  movement because they think they're better than us, when in reality his [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3921.8s)]
*  entire track record is getting everything wrong. Major Spielman, would [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3924.76s)]
*  you think that Donald Trump is heading towards the Nobel Peace Prize if the [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3928.84s)]
*  normal rules apply? First of all, I think he should, and I think if I'm listening [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3932.84s)]
*  to Mark Levin, he's been spot on this entire time, I just have to say. Mark [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3939.32s)]
*  Levin understood the moral courage of the United States and the clarity of [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3943.5600000000004s)]
*  the United States, especially President Trump, who doesn't want to get involved [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3948.2000000000003s)]
*  in foreign wars, but understood that if we do not, if he does not play a role in [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3951.56s)]
*  exerting American strength and helping take out those reactors, we will be [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3956.92s)]
*  facing a bigger war. Let's not forget that Israel fought this war for 11 days [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3960.2s)]
*  pierced by ourselves. The fact that President Trump supplied the weapons we [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3964.92s)]
*  needed, gave us the moral support, and came in at the end not because of Israel, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3969.24s)]
*  he came in at the end because he understood America has skin in the game, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3974.84s)]
*  Israel cannot do all the dirty work. The fact that he showed American strength [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3978.44s)]
*  and then brought this to a close quickly is true peace by strength. That is it. It [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3982.52s)]
*  was the ultimate, ultimate example of peace by strength. The alternative is only [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3989.2400000000002s)]
*  one thing, tyranny by weakness, and I think he showed that, and that's something [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3994.2000000000003s)]
*  we haven't seen for, again, decades and decades, and if there's a Nobel Prize [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=3997.7200000000003s)]
*  that's to be brought about, the Nobel Peace Prize needs to be understood in [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4002.28s)]
*  today's world at the very least without strength, you're not going to get peace. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4006.28s)]
*  That's just the way the cookie crumbles. He absolutely deserves it. I would pin [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4009.8s)]
*  it right on his neck. Gideon Levy, your thoughts on Trump and the Nobel Peace [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4012.84s)]
*  Prize? First of all, he deserves it more than Barack Obama. He did until now more [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4016.76s)]
*  to save lives than Barack Obama did in eight years because this strike in Iran [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4024.84s)]
*  saved lives. It brought the end to this war. This war could have developed into a war of attrition [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4031.72s)]
*  of months and maybe, God forbid, years, and here he came and put an end to it, at least for the [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4038.7599999999998s)]
*  time being. So this by itself, I don't know if Nobel Prize, but for sure some kind of [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4045.96s)]
*  appreciation, and believe me, it's not easy for me. I say, by the way, the same things about [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4051.96s)]
*  Netanyahu. I say it clearly. I wrote a piece for tomorrow. The fact that Netanyahu put an end to [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4056.44s)]
*  this war so quickly, this is enough of a reason to send my appreciation even though there are so [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4062.2000000000003s)]
*  many other things in which Netanyahu does such horrible things. But when they do something right, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4071.32s)]
*  they deserve appreciation. And both of them, Netanyahu and Trump, did the right thing. They [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4077.32s)]
*  put an end to the war just on time. It's another argument if this war was necessary, time will show [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4085.56s)]
*  if it was effective. Time will show, but at least they put an end to it. Now let's see them do the [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4092.92s)]
*  same in Gaza for God's sake. Donald Trump can do it with one phone call, with one phone call, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4098.04s)]
*  and the Gaza war is over. But somehow he cares much less about Gaza than he cares about Iran. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4103.24s)]
*  I think you will see some action with Gaza and Trump. I think he... Hopefully. I think he [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4109.08s)]
*  understands how badly this is now all playing out for Israel. And honestly, I feel for Israelis and [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4114.12s)]
*  for Jewish people around the world, more and more of them have reached out to me and said, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4121.64s)]
*  I'm glad you're criticizing the government for what is happening in our name in Gaza. And it [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4126.2s)]
*  doesn't mean I'm anti-Israel. I'm not. I'm certainly not anti-Jewish. A lot of my friends are Jewish. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4131.24s)]
*  It's not that at all. Having supported Israel's right to defend itself, what is happening now has [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4136.68s)]
*  gone way beyond a country's right to defend itself and way beyond anything that Israel's [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4143.24s)]
*  ever done before to defend itself. And I just don't think they've got a plan for the end of it [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4148.84s)]
*  other than I take Smodrich at his word. They want to get rid of the Palestinians and take over the [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4152.5199999999995s)]
*  Gaza Strip. I don't think that should happen. I believe passionately in a two-state solution. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4158.84s)]
*  Anyway, a very interesting panel discussion. Thank you very much. Can I say something to that or no? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4163.5599999999995s)]

*  everybody's shouting at each other. It's a blessed relief after the last few weeks. So [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4176.92s)]
*  thank you very much. I appreciate it. We even agreed now. We even agreed now. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRKRKhRSug&t=4180.92s)]
