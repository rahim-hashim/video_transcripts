# NASA's UFOs Panel Meets Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs)
*  The full House is expected to vote today on legislation to raise the nation's debt ceiling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=0.0s)]
*  And the trial is underway for the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=4.64s)]
*  in 2018. Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=9.84s)]
*  Later today, the full House is going to vote on legislation to increase the federal government's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=16.4s)]
*  borrowing authority. The bill comes from a deal President Biden struck with Republican Speaker of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=20.88s)]
*  the House Kevin McCarthy. Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren says once the current [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=26.24s)]
*  crisis is over, Congress needs to get rid of the debt ceiling for good. The minute, and I mean the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  minute, we get the votes, we need to eliminate the debt ceiling, and we need to start talking [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=37.92s)]
*  about that now. The federal government will breach its debt ceiling by Monday unless Congress acts [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=42.64s)]
*  to increase it before then. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has scored the debt [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=47.92s)]
*  ceiling legislation. It finds it would cut federal deficits by about one and a half trillion dollars [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=53.44s)]
*  over the next decade. But savings that are trimmed out of the IRS will be lost because there will be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=59.44s)]
*  a drop in tighter enforcement of tax collections. The trial of the man accused of killing 11 people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  and wounding six others at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018 continues today. For Member Station WESA, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=71.68s)]
*  Julia Zenkovich has more. Prosecutors called three witnesses on the trial's first day, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=79.28s)]
*  including Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. Myers is the rabbi in Cantor for one of the three congregations [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=84.08s)]
*  attacked. He survived by hiding in a second-floor bathroom. Testimony so far has included a history [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=89.68s)]
*  of the Jewish faith and the founding of the Tree of Life congregation. Prosecutors have also played [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  911 calls made by some of the victims. Lead defense attorney Judy Clark told the judge that the defense [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=100.4s)]
*  won't dispute the facts of the case. Lawyers for the defense said they do not plan to cross-examine [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=106.4s)]
*  most witnesses. The trial is expected to last two months. For NPR News, I'm Julia Zenkovich in Pittsburgh. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=111.2s)]
*  A NASA panel charged with studying unidentified anomalous phenomena is meeting today in Washington. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  As NPR's Jeff Brumfield reports, they hope to bring some science to the debate over strange things [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=125.2s)]
*  in the sky. From flying saucers to little green men, the government has dealt with claims of what [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=131.12s)]
*  used to be called UFOs for decades. But a lot of the old reports are pretty low quality. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=136.16s)]
*  Astrophysicist David Spergel heads the NASA panel. Fuzzy pictures that people took in the 1950s are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=141.28s)]
*  not terribly valuable. The 21st century has brought some better data, but its collection and study is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=147.68s)]
*  still ad hoc. Spergel says NASA's panel will try to lay out a more scientific approach to looking at [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=153.44s)]
*  UAPs, as they're now known. At today's meeting, they'll also respond to public comments and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=159.2s)]
*  concerns. A final report is expected later this year. Jeff Brumfield, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=164.72s)]
*  NASA says four astronauts have safely returned from the International Space Station. The travelers [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=170.56s)]
*  are with the private commercial company Axiom Space. The crew spent nine days aboard the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  International Space Station. Two of the crew are from Saudi Arabia. The team includes the first [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=180.88s)]
*  Saudi woman to travel into space. North Korea has quickly admitted that it tried to launch a satellite [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=186.56s)]
*  into space today and failed. Pyongyang is promising to try again very quickly to launch a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=193.12s)]
*  satellite to spy on U.S. and South Korean military activity. South Korea says it has salvaged part of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=198.72s)]
*  the failed satellite from the ocean. Officials in South Korea and Japan ordered some residents to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=205.12s)]
*  take shelter after today's launch, but soon rescinded the order when the device fell into the sea. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=210.4s)]
*  A wildfire in Canada has forced about 16,000 people to evacuate their homes. The fire has [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  been burning for several days northwest of Halifax. As Dan Karpanchuk reports, it's one of more than a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=222.32s)]
*  dozen wildfires burning in the eastern Canadian region. Premier Tim Houston says the damage from [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=228.0s)]
*  the fires is extensive and heartbreaking. More than 32,000 acres have been burned, damaging more than [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  200 homes and buildings. Now he's banned all activity in the province's forests including [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=239.2s)]
*  hiking, camping, fishing, hunting and more. He's also pleading with people to obey the burn ban. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=244.24s)]
*  Officials say there are now more than a dozen active wildfires, eight of which started on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=249.92s)]
*  Monday. The problem is hot, dry weather. The deputy fire chief says crews will work patrolling [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=254.16s)]
*  communities and putting out flare-ups and spot fires. And there are now concerns about poor [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=259.44s)]
*  air quality because of the smoke. For NPR News, I'm Dan Karpanchuk in Toronto. You're listening to NPR News. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc0FzfUH8qs&t=264.24s)]
