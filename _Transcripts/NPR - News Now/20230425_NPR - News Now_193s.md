# Biden Running For Reelection, Trump On Trial | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw)
*  President Biden has launched his campaign for re-election to the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=0.0s)]
*  And former President Donald Trump faces accusations of sexual battery and defamation in a New York courtroom today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=4.16s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=10.56s)]
*  President Biden has officially declared he's running for re-election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=15.36s)]
*  He released a video this morning saying he's focused on preserving Americans' personal freedoms. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=19.2s)]
*  The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  More rights or fewer? I know what I want the answer to be and I think you do too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=29.68s)]
*  This is not a time to be complacent. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=35.12s)]
*  That's why I'm running for re-election. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=41.68s)]
*  Because I know America. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Biden specifically cited protecting reproductive rights and preserving the right of Americans to vote. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump goes on trial in New York City today. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=53.84s)]
*  This time NPR's Andrea Bernstein reports he's accused in a civil case of sexual battery and defamation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=57.36s)]
*  Magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll is suing the former president for allegedly raping her in a New York department store dressing room in the 1990s. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=64.4s)]
*  Carroll kept quiet for years but in 2019 wrote a book that includes a detailed account of the alleged assault. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=73.44s)]
*  Trump denied it had happened, denied knowing Carroll and added she was quote, not his type. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=80.16s)]
*  So she sued him for defamation and then in November of 2022 filed a new claim that was under New York's new law allowing adult survivors of alleged sexual battery to sue no matter how many years had passed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=86.0s)]
*  Trump has called the case a hoax and a con job designed to help Carroll sell books. Andrea Bernstein, NPR News, New York. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=98.64s)]
*  In Montana police and riot gear forcibly removed and arrested protesters in the state house of representatives yesterday. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=106.0s)]
*  Montana Public Radio's Shaili Rager reports this comes after a transgender legislator was blocked from speaking on a bill. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=113.68s)]
*  Last week representative Zoe Zephyr, a Democrat from Missoula, was blocked from speaking on the house floor after opposing a bill to ban gender affirming care for transgender minors. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=121.92s)]
*  Republican leadership said she wouldn't be recognized during debate unless she apologized for those comments. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=133.52s)]
*  Yesterday roughly 100 protesters filled the gallery of the state house in response to the silencing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=139.92s)]
*  When Zephyr was blocked again from speaking they erupted in anger. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  The chanting continued and Republican speaker of the house Matt Rager ordered law enforcement to clear the room. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=151.44s)]
*  Protesters were forcibly removed and police in riot gear arrested at least seven people. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=157.44s)]
*  Zephyr says she stands by her original comments. For NPR News, I'm Shaili Rager in Helena. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0HH00GhIlw&t=163.20000000000002s)]
