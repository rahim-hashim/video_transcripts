# 4 Killed In Georgia School Shooting | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk)
*  Vice President Harris heads to Pittsburgh today where she will prepare for next week's presidential debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=0.0s)]
*  And former President Donald Trump sat for an hour-long interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=5.3s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=11.0s)]
*  People in the city of Wynder, Georgia are mourning after yesterday's deadly high school shooting. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=15.5s)]
*  Two students and two teachers were killed and nine people were wounded. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=21.0s)]
*  A 14-year-old student has been arrested in the shooting. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=25.0s)]
*  For Member Station WABE, Royal Valley reports, law enforcement had been previously warned about the suspect. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=28.0s)]
*  The Atlanta office of the FBI says in May of last year, the FBI's National Threat Center received several anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting at an unidentified location and time. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=35.0s)]
*  The agency says it was able to quickly trace the online post to Georgia and relay the information to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=48.0s)]
*  The Sheriff's Office interviewed a boy and his father but found no probable cause to take any additional action. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=57.0s)]
*  That boy is the same one that is now in custody. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=64.0s)]
*  The Georgia Bureau of Investigation says the 14-year-old will be charged with murder and treated legally as an adult. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=68.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Raul Bali in Atlanta. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=75.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris is headed to Pittsburgh today. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=78.0s)]
*  That's where she'll prepare for next week's presidential debate. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=81.0s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaram reports she'll meet former President Donald Trump in Philadelphia for the event. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=84.0s)]
*  Harris has five days of debate boot camp before she heads to Philadelphia. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=90.0s)]
*  It will be one of few highly watched moments that Harris has in her truncated run for the White House and it comes less than two months before voting ends. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=94.0s)]
*  Harris is an experienced debater known for her ability to make decisions and to be a leader in the public. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=103.0s)]
*  Harris is a very experienced debater known for her quick wit on stage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=110.0s)]
*  But the last time she took part in a debate was four years ago against then Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=113.0s)]
*  The debate next Tuesday hosted by ABC News will be the first time Harris and Trump have ever met. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=119.0s)]
*  The rules will be similar to Trump's last debate with President Biden in that the microphones for each candidate will be muted when it's not their turn to speak. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=126.0s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=135.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump met with supporters last night in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=137.0s)]
*  The conversation was hosted by Fox's Sean Hannity. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=142.0s)]
*  Trump criticized Vice President Harris over fracking, a key topic in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=145.0s)]
*  During Harris's first presidential run in 2020, she said she would ban the practice. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=151.0s)]
*  But in last week's interview on CNN, she reversed her position on fracking. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=157.0s)]
*  At a town hall on the Fox News channel, Trump said Pennsylvania voters should not accept Harris's change of mind. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=162.0s)]
*  You can't take the chance. You have no choice. You've got to vote for me. You've got to vote for me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=168.0s)]
*  Even if you don't like me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=174.0s)]
*  Trump speaks today to the Economic Club of New York. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=179.0s)]
*  His campaign says he will deliver a major speech on the economy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=185.0s)]
*  The National Football League regular season kicks off tonight defending Super Bowl champions. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=189.0s)]
*  The Kansas City Chiefs will host the Baltimore Ravens in season opener. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=194.0s)]
*  NPR's Becky Sullivan reports. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=198.0s)]
*  In nearly six decades of Super Bowl history, never has a team won three times in a row. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=201.0s)]
*  Not even dynasties like the Steelers of the 1970s nor the Tom Brady Patriots. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=206.0s)]
*  None of them could do what Patrick Mahomes and the rest of the Chiefs hoped to achieve this year. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=211.0s)]
*  But they will have plenty of challengers, including the ascendant Houston Texans who have loaded up around their second year quarterback CJ Stroud. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=215.0s)]
*  Or maybe the long-suffering Detroit Lions who fell just short of their first ever Super Bowl appearance last season. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=223.0s)]
*  On Sunday, a handful of intriguing rookie quarterbacks will also make their debuts, including Caleb Williams, the electric Heisman winner from USC who was drafted first overall by the Chicago Bears. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=229.0s)]
*  Becky Sullivan, NPR News. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=240.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RYK4dlwgYk&t=243.0s)]
