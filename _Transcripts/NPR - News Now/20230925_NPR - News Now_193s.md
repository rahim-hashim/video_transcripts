# Union: Shutdown Risks ‘Mass Exodus’ Of Federal Wildland Firefighters | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4)
*  Hollywood's writers and major studios have reached a tentative deal that could end a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=0.0s)]
*  nearly five-month-long strike, and thousands of federal wildland firefighters are bracing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  for pay cuts later this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=9.88s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=13.0s)]
*  There's a tentative agreement between striking writers and Hollywood studios. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  If approved by striking writers, it could end a five-month-long walkout. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=21.32s)]
*  Details of the proposed agreement have not yet been disclosed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=25.72s)]
*  Writers Guild member and strike captain Bill Wolkoff says he is eager to see the terms. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=29.24s)]
*  I know they would not have told us a tentative deal was reached and told us that picketing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=34.64s)]
*  is suspended if it wasn't exemplary. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=41.44s)]
*  CEOs from four Hollywood studios join negotiators at the table. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  They're facing thorny issues from higher residual payments when shows go into reruns and protections [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=48.8s)]
*  against artificial intelligence. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Thousands of federal wildland firefighters are bracing for major pay cuts in less than [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=57.36s)]
*  a week unless Congress intervenes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=62.36s)]
*  NPR's Kirk Siegler reports an expected government shutdown before then is stoking fears of mass [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=64.64s)]
*  resignations within the force. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=71.0s)]
*  About 19,000 federal wildland firefighters could see their paycheck slash starting this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=73.68s)]
*  coming Sunday unless Congress passes pending legislation that would give them a permanent [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=77.98s)]
*  increase. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=82.56s)]
*  Prior to the fall of 2021, some rookie firefighters on the front lines of major wildfires had [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=83.56s)]
*  been making $15 an hour. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=88.56s)]
*  That year, U.S. Forest Service and other federal agency firefighters got temporary pay raises [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=91.08s)]
*  of up to $20,000 from the infrastructure law, but now those are set to expire. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=95.76s)]
*  In the meantime, efforts to give wildland firefighters a permanent pay raise have stalled [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=100.76s)]
*  and divided Congress. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=104.88s)]

*  24-hour period. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  The surge has also overwhelmed migrant resource centers such as the one in San Antonio, which [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=165.48s)]
*  has been averaging around 750 migrants a day seeking assistance. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=170.04s)]

*  increase in crossings. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdNUF2uGK4&t=179.83999999999997s)]
