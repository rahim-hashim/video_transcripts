*  accommodate passengers with disabilities. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nagswPxDwgo&t=147.96s)]
*  Travelers who use wheelchairs have long complained that airlines often damage or lose them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nagswPxDwgo&t=151.32s)]
*  Now the Biden administration is trying to change that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nagswPxDwgo&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says the proposed rule would make it easier to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nagswPxDwgo&t=159.24s)]
*  hold airlines accountable when they damage or delay the return of a wheelchair. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nagswPxDwgo&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  This is about making sure that all Americans can travel safely and with dignity. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nagswPxDwgo&t=166.68s)]
