# House Ethics Committee Releases Report On Matt Gaetz | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk)
*  The House Ethics Committee has released a report on its investigation into former Congressman Matt Gaetz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=0.0s)]
*  And the suspect in the death of UnitedHealthcare's CEO is pleaded not guilty to murder charges in New York State. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good afternoon. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=12.6s)]
*  The House Ethics Committee has released the report of its investigation into former Congressman Matt Gaetz. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  This is on allegations of sexual misconduct. The report has been secret until today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=22.6s)]
*  In the introduction to the report, the Ethics Committee concluded there was substantial evidence that Gaetz violated House rules and the law regarding prostitution and drug use, among other allegations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Gaetz has consistently denied the allegations. Earlier today, he filed a lawsuit seeking to block the release of the report. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=40.2s)]
*  The man accused of shooting and killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside a New York City hotel has pleaded not guilty to state murder charges. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=48.0s)]
*  From member station WNYC, Samantha Max reports that includes first degree murder in furtherance of terrorism. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=57.0s)]
*  Prosecutors say Luigi Mangione targeted the health insurance executive while he was in New York City for an investor conference. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  They say he waited for about an hour outside Thompson's hotel and then shot him from behind with an untraceable ghost gun. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=72.2s)]
*  Mangione has become an antihero for people who are frustrated with the health insurance industry. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=79.4s)]
*  But police, prosecutors and the New York City mayor have criticized Mangione. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=85.2s)]
*  Mangione's defense attorney said in court that he's innocent until proven guilty. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=90.8s)]
*  She also said official statements about the case could hurt his chance of getting a fair trial. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=95.4s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Samantha Max in New York. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=101.0s)]
*  The White House says President Biden has given clemency to nearly every prisoner on federal death row. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=104.4s)]
*  The sentences of 37 men have been changed to life in prison without parole. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=110.0s)]
*  But Biden did not lift death sentences for three people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=114.6s)]
*  They include Robert Bowers, convicted of the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=118.0s)]
*  Dylann Roof, convicted of the mass shooting at a black church near Charleston, South Carolina, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=122.6s)]
*  and Jokhar Tsarnaev, who bombed the Boston Marathon. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=127.8s)]
*  President-elect Trump wants the U.S. to take back control of the Panama Canal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=131.2s)]
*  The U.S. relinquished that control in 1999 in accordance with a treaty. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=135.4s)]
*  But speaking to a conservative conference in Phoenix yesterday, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump says the canal fees are too expensive and Panama is not respecting U.S. generosity. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=149.0s)]
*  then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America in full, quickly and without question. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=156.4s)]
*  Panama's president quickly released a statement disputing that one reason Panama Canal fees have increased [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=167.0s)]
*  is because drought in Central America has made water more scarce. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=172.8s)]
*  Trump also wrote online the U.S. needs to own and control Greenland. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=177.2s)]
*  That is a district of Denmark that partially governs itself. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=181.2s)]
*  During his first term in the White House, Trump said he wanted to buy Greenland, but Denmark told him no. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=185.4s)]
*  Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced that they plan to merge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=191.6s)]
*  This would create the world's third largest carmaker behind Toyota and Volkswagen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=196.6s)]
*  NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=201.4s)]
*  The plan is for Honda and Nissan to have a formal merger agreement by June [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=204.2s)]
*  and establish a new holding company by summer of 2026. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=208.6s)]
*  Mitsubishi Motors, which is partially owned by Nissan, may also join the deal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=212.4s)]
*  Nissan has been struggling financially, and if Honda doesn't bail it out, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  analysts see it as a choice target for a foreign takeover. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=220.6s)]
*  Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said at a press conference that they need to pool resources [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=224.2s)]
*  to stay competitive in the world's largest car market, China, where local firms are squeezing out foreign carmakers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=228.8s)]
*  Mibe said the merger could still fall through, or as he put it, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=235.6s)]
*  Anthony Kuhn in PR News, Seoul. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=242.6s)]
*  Workers at Amazon facilities remain on strike in several cities. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=245.0s)]
*  The Teamsters Union says the online retailer has failed to come to the bargaining table to hammer out labor contracts. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=249.0s)]
*  Amazon says that the union does not represent all its workers, many of whom are third-party contractors. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=255.8s)]
*  The Teamsters claim that nearly 10,000 Amazon workers have mobilized for the action. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=262.2s)]
*  Discount supplier Party City is bankrupt, and the company says it is starting to close down all of its operations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=268.2s)]
*  All of its locations are being sold for good, and party supplies are being sold at deep discounts. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=275.8s)]
*  Party City was founded almost 40 years ago. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=281.6s)]
*  New leaders in Syria have made several high-level appointments to the interim government. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=284.6s)]
*  They're seeking to rebuild the country and its relations with the world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=289.6s)]
*  Some of the appointees have ties to neighboring Turkey, and Piers Fatma Tanis reports from Istanbul. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=293.6s)]
*  Turkey has long backed the opposition to Bashar al-Assad's regime and is hosting the largest number of Syrian refugees in the world. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=300.0s)]
*  Now, the country is set to play an influential role in the new Syria. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=307.0s)]
*  Syria's new foreign minister, Assad al-Shebani, lived in Turkey and was pursuing graduate studies in international relations at a university in Istanbul. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=311.0s)]
*  The new governor of Aleppo, Azam al-Gharib, was part of a Turkish proxy rebel group and completed his master's at a university in Turkey. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=320.0s)]
*  And the first woman to have a role in the new administration, Ayse El-Dibs, will head the Women's Affairs Office. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=329.0s)]
*  She led an NGO in Turkey and worked with Syrian refugees. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=336.0s)]
*  She's a dual citizen of Turkey and Syria. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=339.0s)]
*  Fatma Tanis, NPR News, Istanbul. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmzFmuMsLk&t=342.0s)]
