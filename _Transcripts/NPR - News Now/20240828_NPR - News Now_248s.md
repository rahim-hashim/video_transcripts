**NPR - News Now:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE)
*  Republican Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance is slamming a superseding indictment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=0.0s)]
*  against former President Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=4.72s)]
*  And even without her endorsement, Taylor Swift's fans are organizing for Vice President Harris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=6.72s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=12.52s)]
*  I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=13.52s)]
*  And here are today's tough stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=15.08s)]
*  President Biden says his administration will defend a program that's aimed at helping nearly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  a half million unauthorized migrants who are married to U.S. citizens. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=22.46s)]
*  The Keeping Families Together initiative was temporarily halted by a federal judge in Texas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=27.58s)]
*  MP Osorio Martinez Beltran has more. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=32.62s)]
*  In a statement, Biden calls Monday's ruling wrong and says that America, quote, is not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=35.1s)]
*  a country that tears families apart. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=39.82s)]
*  His Keeping Families Together program allows migrants who are in the U.S. illegally but [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=42.22s)]
*  have lived in the country for at least 10 years and who are married to a U.S. citizen [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=46.18s)]
*  to apply for legal status without having to leave the U.S. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  Those who qualify will be shielded from deportation, could get a work permit and eventually apply [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  for citizenship. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  But 16 Republican-led states challenged the program last week, claiming it was unlawful. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=59.98s)]
*  Monday's ruling means the Biden administration can continue accepting applications, but for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=65.5s)]
*  the next 14 days can take no further action. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=69.74s)]

*  Trump, this after the Supreme Court granted former presidents substantial immunity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=87.46s)]
*  It looks like Jack Smith doing more of what he does, which is filing these absurd lawsuits [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=92.88s)]
*  in an effort to influence the election. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE&t=96.88s)]
