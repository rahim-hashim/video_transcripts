# Former Proud Boys Leader Enrique Tarrio To Be Sentenced Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, September 5th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=0.0s)]
*  The former leader of the far-right group, the Proud Boys, will be sentenced today in federal court in Washington. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=6.4s)]
*  Enrique Tarrio is facing decades in prison for his role in the January 6th attack at the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Jaclyn Diaz says Tarrio is among five members of his group convicted of seditious conspiracy or other crimes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=18.6s)]
*  Prosecutors say Tarrio and his lieutenants saw themselves as foot soldiers of the right. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=26.4s)]
*  He was convicted along with four other members of the Proud Boys back in May. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  On January 6, 2021, Tarrio wasn't at the Capitol. Rather, he was at a hotel room outside of Washington, D.C. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=36.1s)]
*  Prosecutors say from this position, Tarrio urged his members to take control of the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=43.8s)]
*  Prosecutors are seeking 33 years for Tarrio. But the judge is likely to give him less. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=49.5s)]
*  Some of Tarrio's co-defendants have received lengthy prison sentences, but shorter than what the government had requested. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=55.5s)]
*  Jaclyn Diaz, NPR News. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=62.1s)]
*  The Texas State Senate will open an impeachment trial today against Attorney General Ken Paxton. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=64.2s)]
*  He is accused of several counts of corruption. Paxton says he is innocent and derides the case as a politically motivated sham. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=70.4s)]
*  Leaders of the United Auto Workers say they are pressuring the big three automakers to agree to huge changes in their contracts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=79.0s)]
*  UAW workers are seeking a 46 percent pay raise, a 32-hour work week with full pay, and the return of traditional pensions. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=86.2s)]
*  UAW President Sean Fain says the union is determined. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=94.8s)]
*  If we don't get our share of social and economic justice, I can guarantee you one thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=98.7s)]
*  Come September 14th, we're going to take action to get it by any means necessary. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=105.1s)]
*  Officials with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis say the union's demands are unreasonable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  They cite international competition as the industry changes to electric vehicles. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=116.89999999999999s)]
*  China's top leader, Xi Jinping, will not be among the world leaders who are attending the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi, India, this coming weekend. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=122.8s)]
*  Instead, China is sending its premier. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=131.7s)]
*  Beijing has not given an explanation for this snub, but NPR's Emily Fang reports why Xi will be absent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=134.4s)]
*  China's foreign ministry said Premier Li Qiang, widely seen as a Xi ally, will attend the summit. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  Xi Jinping has not said why he won't attend the meeting, which will be hosted by India's Narendra Modi. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  Xi does have more than enough to do at home, however. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=153.1s)]
*  Critical sectors of the Chinese economy have been tanking, namely real estate and construction. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=156.1s)]
*  And that's dragged down economic growth and worsened business sentiment in the country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=161.0s)]
*  And China-India relations have gone from bad to worse. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=165.1s)]
*  Soldiers from the two countries had a fatal brawl near a contested border in 2020. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=168.7s)]
*  And since then, China and India have expelled all of each other's journalists. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=173.1s)]
*  Emily Fang, NPR News, Taipei. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=177.5s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNT9jOvDGfw&t=179.5s)]
