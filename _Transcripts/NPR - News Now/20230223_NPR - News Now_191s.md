# Winter Storms Pummeling Much Of The U.S. | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4)
*  Two major winter storms are pummeling much of the country this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=0.0s)]
*  And investors are learning more about how the Federal Reserve plans to fight inflation in the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=3.84s)]
*  near future. Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=8.48s)]
*  The National Weather Service says two major winter storms are pelting much of the country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=14.32s)]
*  There's a weather system in Southern California that will turn into blizzard conditions in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=18.88s)]
*  mountainous areas by tomorrow. That could affect travel just outside Los Angeles. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=23.28s)]
*  A second storm is bringing more blizzard conditions to northern states. That includes [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  South Dakota. Dustin Hanson is with the Public Works Department in the city of Sioux Falls and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=33.28s)]
*  he says crews have been plowing streets. So we'll run 24-hour shifts until we get this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  this event cleaned up. Likely be working through Sunday and potentially in the next week on these [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=44.56s)]
*  12-hour shifts. Farther east, ice and snow have cut power to more than three quarters of a million [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  customers in Michigan and Illinois alone. That's according to the tracking site PowerOutage.us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=55.36s)]
*  Minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting offer new insights into how the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=61.92s)]
*  central bank is approaching inflation. NPR's Scott Horsley tells us the Fed has raised interest rates [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  aggressively as it tries to bring prices under control. The Fed has raised interest rates eight [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=72.64s)]
*  times since March, including its most recent rate hike of a quarter percentage point earlier this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=77.44s)]
*  month. The vote for that rate increase was unanimous, but newly released minutes show a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=82.08s)]
*  few members of the rate setting committee were willing to go even faster and boost borrowing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=86.88s)]
*  costs by a half percentage point instead. The Fed has telegraphed that additional rate hikes are [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=90.8s)]
*  likely. Investors now expect that interest rates will stay higher for longer than they were [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=96.48s)]
*  anticipating just a few weeks ago. Some Fed officials think that as consumers become more [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=100.88s)]
*  price sensitive, businesses will be forced to cut their profit margins. That could also help to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=105.36s)]
*  bring down inflation. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. The Canadian Defense Department says [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=110.08s)]
*  it is aware of Chinese efforts to conduct surveillance operations in Canadian air, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=115.2s)]
*  space and waters. As Dan Karpanchuk tells us, an earlier report said Chinese surveillance [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=120.0s)]
*  bullies had been detected in Arctic waters. Defense Department spokesman Daniel LeBoutillier [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  would not provide further information saying it's to ensure the integrity of military operations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=130.24s)]
*  Toronto's Globe and Mail had reported that the Canadian military had detected Chinese [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=135.28s)]
*  monitoring buoys in the Arctic. An expert on Arctic marine security says buoys were likely [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=139.36s)]
*  dropped by Chinese icebreakers and could be used to chart the sea floor in Canadian territory [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  and perhaps even track American submarines. Earlier, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  Melanie Jolie referred to China as an increasingly disruptive power, adding that Ottawa will work [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=154.8s)]
*  with NORAD to protect North American airspace and take a strong position on Canada's Arctic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  sovereignty. For NPR News, I'm Dan Karpanchuk in Toronto. The United Nations General Assembly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=164.88s)]
*  is expected to vote today on a resolution. It calls for peace in Ukraine. The first [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is tomorrow. The draft resolution at the UN [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=176.48s)]
*  calls for an immediate ceasefire. It also demands that Russia leave Ukraine. You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weSGpAh9Fz4&t=182.0s)]
