# Johnson Pushes Foreign Aid Bills Despite Threat To Speakership | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ)
*  President Biden is endorsing House Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to pass a series of foreign aid bills. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And Hawaii has released the first findings from an investigation into last year's wildfires on the island of Maui. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=5.36s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=11.92s)]
*  President Biden says he strongly supports House Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to split a foreign aid package into parts. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=16.16s)]
*  Johnson's main focus is to decouple foreign aid for Israel from aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Some Republicans oppose USAID to Ukraine, but would back a standalone aid bill for Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  Johnson's step, however, has angered a few Republican lawmakers who want to force him out of the speaker's job. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=33.12s)]
*  Johnson dismissed that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=39.36s)]
*  My philosophy is you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=40.96s)]
*  I don't, if I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=44.64s)]
*  It's not clear if the effort to force the speaker out of his job will succeed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=50.72s)]
*  Western countries are urging Israel not to escalate the current fighting in the Middle East, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=55.2s)]
*  where Israel is engaged in conflicts on three separate fronts. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=59.84s)]
*  As NPR's Greg Meyry reports, Israel's war cabinet is debating how to respond [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=63.92s)]
*  after Iran's direct attack last weekend but is not tipping its hand. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=68.72s)]
*  The U.S., Britain and Germany are all counseling Israel to show restraint following the recent airstrikes by Iran. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  Israel's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, says he appreciates the advice but adds, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=80.48s)]
*  quote, we will make our own decisions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  The direct confrontation with Iran adds a layer of complexity to the region's turmoil. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  Rocket fire by the Lebanese group Hezbollah wounded more than a dozen Israeli soldiers [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=93.04s)]
*  stationed near the country's northern border. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  And Israeli airstrikes are still pounding Gaza in the ongoing war against Hamas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel's conflicts with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran all date back decades [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=106.16s)]
*  but have never been this active on all three fronts at the same time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=111.28s)]
*  Greg Meyry, NPR News. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=115.92s)]
*  The criminal trial against former President Donald Trump resumes today in New York. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=117.92s)]
*  Prosecutors in the defense need to pick 11 more jurors and alternates. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=122.4s)]
*  Seven jurors are already seated. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal an affair before the 2016 election. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=129.12s)]
*  He denies the charges. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=135.04s)]
*  Hawaii's Attorney General has released the first findings of an investigation [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=136.88s)]
*  of last year's wildfires in Maui. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=141.2s)]
*  NPR's Greg Allen tells us the report presents a detailed timeline of the fire that killed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=143.84s)]
*  more than 100 people, destroyed some 3,000 properties and left thousands homeless. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=149.68s)]
*  The 375-page report is the first phase of an investigation being conducted by the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Fire Safety Research Institute. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=159.28s)]
*  The report confirms information that the fire appears to have started around 6.30 in the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=161.2s)]
*  morning. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=165.28s)]
*  Fire crews responded immediately and a little after 2 p.m. reported it was extinguished. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=166.0s)]
*  But within an hour the blaze flared up again and spread to the town of Lahaina, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  driven by high winds from a passing hurricane. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=174.0s)]
*  The timeline raises questions about the actions of Maui's Emergency Management Agency [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=176.72s)]
*  and Mayor Richard Bissen, who declined the state's offer of assistance [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=180.64s)]
*  and didn't issue an emergency declaration until after Lahaina had been destroyed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=184.0s)]
*  Greg Allen, NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=188.56s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuNwEvM7kQ&t=190.4s)]
