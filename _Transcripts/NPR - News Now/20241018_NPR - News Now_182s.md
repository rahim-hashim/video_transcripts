# Hamas Confirms Its Leader, Yahya Sinwar, Is Dead | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, October 18th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=0.0s)]
*  The militant group Hamas has confirmed its leader Yahya Sinwar was killed by Israeli forces. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  The Israeli military announced yesterday it had killed Sinwar in a blast in Rafa in southern Gaza. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=11.58s)]
*  But as NPR's Hadil Al-Shalchi reports, Hamas remains defiant. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=16.52s)]
*  Hamas says it will not back down and that Israel's killing of its leaders will not end their movement or eliminate it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=20.66s)]
*  In a statement released Friday, the Hamas political bureau said that it was, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=26.88s)]
*  painful and distressing to lose its leader, Yahya Sinwar, but that he has now become, quote, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  an icon for the Palestinian people. Sinwar is the latest high profile killing of a Hamas leader. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  In July, Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's leader at the time, was killed in Tehran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=41.04s)]
*  And in August, the Israeli military said it killed Mohammed Dif, who was in charge of Hamas's military wing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=45.12s)]
*  Hamas did not confirm that killing. Sinwar's killing brings up the question of who will now take over Hamas [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  and whether Israel and the militant group can move closer to a ceasefire and a deal to release the hostages still in Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shalchi, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=62.84s)]
*  President Biden, traveling in Germany, spoke about the killing of Sinwar. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=65.36s)]
*  The death of the leader of Hamas represents a moment of justice. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  He had the blood of Americans and Israelis, Palestinians and Germans and so many others on his hands. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  Biden says he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=79.0s)]
*  and that he urged the Israeli leader to use this moment as an opportunity to seek peace. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=83.44s)]
*  But in a statement, Netanyahu said that the war is not over. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=88.92s)]
*  Separately, Iran, a supporter of Hamas, has commemorated Sinwar in a statement. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=93.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Hezbollah militants in Lebanon say they are entering a new phase in their fight against Israeli troops who are in Lebanon. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=98.88s)]
*  Hezbollah claims it is now using new weapons against Israel, including explosive drones and missiles. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=106.4s)]
*  Earlier this week, an explosive drone struck an Israeli army hall in northern Israel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Four Israeli soldiers were killed and dozens of others were injured. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=118.2s)]
*  Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will campaign in the swing state of Michigan today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=122.76s)]
*  From member station WDET, Quinn Klinefelter reports their visits come as in-person voting is set to begin in Detroit this weekend. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=129.36s)]
*  Harris joined a national radio show broadcast from Detroit earlier this week. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  Today, she stumps in Grand Rapids and the state capital of Lansing before finishing with an event in Metro Detroit's Oakland County. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=142.72s)]
*  She's expected in the city itself tomorrow for the start of early in-person voting. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=150.0s)]
*  Harris needs a strong turnout from the typically Democratic stronghold where Trump has tried to make inroads. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=155.2s)]
*  He'll be in Oakland County as well for a roundtable discussion before heading to a rally at Detroit's Huntington Place, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=161.2s)]
*  a convention center Trump falsely claimed was the site of massive voter fraud in 2020. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=168.24s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Quinn Klinefelter in Detroit. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=174.24s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RyEYth6A5I&t=178.64s)]
