# DOJ Asks Supreme Court To Take Up Abortion Pill Question | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU)
*  The Justice Department is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to maintain Americans' access to the abortion pill Mifipristom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=0.0s)]
*  And China says it won't sell weapons to the parties involved in the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=12.0s)]
*  The suspect in the leaking of sensitive Pentagon documents online will be arraigned today in Boston. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=17.0s)]
*  Jack Tashara will be charged under a provision of the Espionage Act. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=22.0s)]
*  The Justice Department has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop any changes limiting access to an abortion medication while a federal lawsuit plays out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=27.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reports doctors who provide abortions are trying to navigate legal uncertainty. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=36.0s)]
*  There are currently competing court decisions in different parts of the country that concern access to Mifipristom. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=43.0s)]
*  That's one medication used to stop a pregnancy either for abortion or in treatment of a miscarriage. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=49.0s)]
*  It's used in combination with another drug. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=55.0s)]
*  Doctors who provide abortion, like Dr. Kristin Brandi, are calling each other, trying to figure out whether they can keep prescribing medicine that has been standard practice for decades. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=57.0s)]
*  Offices are getting calls from patients asking if they can still get their medication abortion that they have scheduled. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=66.0s)]
*  So it's just been mayhem. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=72.0s)]
*  Any changes to access will only affect this one drug used for abortions and likely only in some places, but the legal situation for physicians is still very unclear. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=76.0s)]
*  Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR News. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=86.0s)]
*  A wildfire continues to burn in northern New Jersey. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=88.0s)]
*  It's about a third contained. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=91.0s)]
*  The fire is about 700 acres, but it's threatening several homes. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=93.0s)]
*  New Jersey Forest Fire Service Chief Greg McLaughlin says that's because the surrounding area is filled with flammable items. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=97.0s)]
*  These are pieces of bark and pine needles, if you will, leaves and other debris that catch fire and then travel sometimes long distances to start new spot fires. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=105.0s)]
*  Meanwhile in Wisconsin, Governor Tony Evers has declared a state of emergency because of heightened wildfire conditions there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=119.0s)]
*  China says it won't sell weapons to the parties involved in the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=127.0s)]
*  It's a response to concerns from the U.S. and others that China was considering providing military assistance to Russia. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=132.0s)]
*  NPR's Awen Zhao reports from Beijing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=139.0s)]
*  Speaking at a news conference with his visiting German counterpart in Beijing, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=142.0s)]
*  Chinese Foreign Minister Ching-Kong reiterated China's willingness to help facilitate negotiations to find a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine conflict. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=146.0s)]
*  He said that all parties should remain, quote, objective and calm. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=155.0s)]
*  When speaking about the concerns over the tensions in the Taiwan Strait, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=160.0s)]
*  Ching said that Taiwan was, quote, China's internal affair and bore no outside interference, and, quote, Taiwan independence and peace cannot coexist. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=164.0s)]
*  Beijing recently held large-scale military drills around Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate the island it claims as its own territory after its President Tsai Ing-wen's U.S. visit. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=175.0s)]
*  Awen Zhao, NPR News, Beijing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=187.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxLaX9J3ctU&t=190.0s)]
