# Rescuers Race To Find Submersible Missing Since Sunday | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI)
*  The search for a submersible that went missing in the North Atlantic Ocean has entered another day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=0.0s)]
*  And the House of Representatives has voted to censure Democratic Representative Adam Schiff. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=5.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=10.32s)]
*  Fire officials in northern Texas say four people have been killed after a tornado [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  burst into the town of Matador last evening. It's north of Lubbock. Another 10 have been injured. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=19.44s)]
*  And substantial damage is reported. Another tornado in the region late last week [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=24.88s)]
*  killed three people and injured about 100 others. This is the fifth day of searching [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=29.6s)]
*  for a missing submersible in the North Atlantic Ocean. Five people are aboard. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=35.36s)]
*  From member station WBUR, Walter Wuthman has more. Rescue crews continue their search through the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=40.08s)]
*  night but still haven't found the missing submersible. They're using remote-operated [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  vehicles to try to locate the origin of underwater banging sounds that were picked up earlier in the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=50.0s)]
*  week. Coast Guard officials say they haven't determined the source of those noises and that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  they're not necessarily proof of life. Meanwhile, the submersible's estimated oxygen reserves are [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=58.96s)]
*  running out. On board the vessel are a British adventurer, a French Titanic expert, two Pakistani [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=64.64s)]
*  family members, and the American pilot. For NPR News, I'm Walter Wuthman in Boston. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=70.48s)]
*  The House of Representatives has voted on party lines to censure California Democratic [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=76.08s)]
*  Congressman Adam Schiff. He's the former head of the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=81.04s)]
*  want to punish him over his investigations into then-President Donald Trump. Schiff says with the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=86.56s)]
*  censure vote, Republican House members have told him that he has been effective in the defense of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=92.64s)]
*  American democracy. To my Republican colleagues who introduced this resolution, I thank you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=97.92s)]
*  You honor me with your enmity. You flatter me with this falsehood. The resolution claims Schiff [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=103.84s)]
*  misled Americans about the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Other probes have not [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=110.32s)]
*  found conclusive evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=116.8s)]
*  election. A Massachusetts Air National Guardsman has pleaded not guilty to six federal charges [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  of sharing top secret Pentagon documents online. Jack Tashara remains jailed in Massachusetts. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=129.76s)]
*  No trial date has yet been set. The National Transportation Safety Board opened investigative [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=136.24s)]
*  hearings with a community meeting last night in East Palestine, Ohio. Officials are investigating [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=142.0s)]
*  the toxic train derailment last February. From Ideastream Public Media, Abigail Botar has this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  report. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homidy took questions from residents while explaining how the board is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  investigating the train derailment and controlled burn of toxic chemicals. The NTSB's goal is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=160.0s)]
*  to prevent a tragedy from reoccurring and we issue those safety recommendations that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=166.16s)]
*  we believe would do that and then we fight vigorously to get those implemented. The NTSB [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=171.84s)]
*  is holding public investigative hearings Thursday and Friday in East Palestine. Topics include [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=178.96s)]
*  emergency responder preparedness, hazard communications and rail tank car safety. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=183.76s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Abigail Botar. It's NPR. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2NN91wYPEI&t=188.32s)]
