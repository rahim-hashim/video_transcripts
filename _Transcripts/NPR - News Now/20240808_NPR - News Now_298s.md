# Trump Praises Walz In 2020 Audio Recording | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ)
*  Tropical Storm Debbie continues to creep north, inundating South Carolina with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=0.0s)]
*  more than 20 inches of rain. And one year after the devastating wildfires in Maui, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=5.0s)]
*  residents there are starting to rebuild. Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  News and here are today's top stories. Tropical Storm Debbie is creeping over [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=14.88s)]
*  South Carolina. It's still got top winds of 50 miles per hour, but the greatest [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=19.56s)]
*  danger remains flooding. Some areas of South Carolina will get 20 inches of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=23.68s)]
*  rain or more. Debbie also inundated Georgia. Sandra Martin lives about 50 [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=27.84s)]
*  miles west of Savannah where the local river overflowed its banks and water [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=32.92s)]
*  surged into her home. Everything in the house is underwater, appliances, beds, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=36.96s)]
*  everything. We just didn't have time to get it out. It came in too quick. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=42.72s)]
*  Tropical Storm Debbie is slowly moving up the East Coast. There are tornado [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=47.16s)]
*  watches in North Carolina and southern Virginia. A tornado overnight hit the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=51.16s)]
*  downtown of Wilson, North Carolina and damaged several buildings. An audio [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=56.08s)]
*  recording from 2020 shows then President Donald Trump praising Minnesota Governor [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Tim Walz's response to unrest in Minneapolis during Black Lives Matter [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=65.36s)]
*  protests. As NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Laban reports, the tape complicates one of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=70.2s)]
*  Trump's main lines of attack on the Democratic vice presidential nominee. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=75.32s)]
*  The audio first reported by ABC News was also posted by the Harris Campaign's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  account on X. I know Governor Walz is on the phone and we spoke and I fully [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=84.56s)]
*  agreed with the way he handled it the last couple of days. I asked him to do [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=92.04s)]
*  that. Republicans have been attacking Walz for his response to a wave of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=95.56s)]
*  sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis. Those protests were a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=99.08s)]
*  response to the police killing of George Floyd. In 2020, Walz faced [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=102.72s)]
*  criticism for not calling in the National Guard sooner. In the audio, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=107.04s)]
*  Trump takes credit for having told walls to call in those troops. Danielle [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=111.0s)]
*  Kurtz-Laban, NPR News. Former President Donald Trump has announced he'll hold a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=115.32s)]
*  press conference this afternoon at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. This comes a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=119.2s)]
*  day after his running mate, J.D. Vance, claimed Democratic presidential nominee [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=123.72s)]
*  Kamala Harris isn't talking to the media. The head of the National Transportation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=128.08s)]
*  Safety Board says the in-flight loss of a door plug on a Boeing jet in January [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=133.0s)]
*  was completely avoidable. As David Schaper reports, the NTSB grilled [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=137.68s)]
*  executives from Boeing and officials with the FAA yesterday on the second day [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=142.6s)]
*  of an investigative hearing. After more than 20 hours of testimony in a seven [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=147.52s)]
*  month investigation, it's still not clear how the Boeing 737 MAX jetliner was [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=152.16s)]
*  able to leave the factory without four critical bolts needed to hold the door [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=157.16s)]
*  plug in place. No one was seriously hurt when the panel blew out, but it could [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=162.16s)]
*  have been much worse, says NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy. She told reporters that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=166.68s)]
*  there's a history of safety lapses and lax oversight at the Boeing factory. We [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=171.36s)]
*  have a situation where an accident should have never occurred because it [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  should have been caught years before. The two-day hearing also examined Boeing's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  safety culture and the FAA's oversight. The NTSB's investigation continues. For [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=183.44s)]
*  NPR News, I'm David Schaper. Maui residents are starting to rebuild their [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  homes one year after the devastating wildfires in Hawaii. With some of those [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=193.96s)]
*  homes right on the ocean, officials are weighing how they should prepare for [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=199.0s)]
*  rising sea levels. NPR's Lauren Summer has more. The waterfront in Lahaina was a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=203.36s)]
*  destination full of historic buildings and shops. After the fire that destroyed [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=208.56s)]
*  more than 2,000 buildings, many of those landowners are eager to rebuild what [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=213.28s)]
*  they lost. But for properties on the ocean, Maui officials recently passed new [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=217.44s)]
*  building rules. Sea levels are expected to rise three feet by the end of the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=222.0s)]
*  century as the climate gets hotter. The rules now prohibit building in places [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=226.28s)]
*  that could be flooded. In Lahaina, officials say they'll be working with [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=230.56s)]
*  landowners one-on-one to determine what can be built so the town will be better [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=234.08s)]
*  at withstanding future disasters. Lauren Summer, NPR News. A strong earthquake [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=238.44s)]
*  struck off southwestern Japan today, triggering tsunami warnings. The [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=244.08s)]
*  magnitude of the quake was 7.1 and Beers Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul that so [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=248.04s)]
*  far there have been no reports of casualties. The quake struck near Japan's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=253.28s)]
*  Kyushu Island at a depth of more than 18 miles below the earth's surface. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=257.28s)]
*  National broadcaster NHK reported that waves up to about 20 inches high had [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=261.12s)]
*  already been sighted. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed officials to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  keep the public informed, evacuate residents if necessary, and prioritize [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=270.52s)]
*  saving lives. Japan's meteorological agency warned of more possible quakes in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=274.92s)]
*  the coming days. On the first day of this year, a 7.6 magnitude quake struck off [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=280.04s)]
*  the west coast of Japan's Noto Peninsula, killing more than 280 people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=285.68s)]
*  Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Seoul. You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrg0GED_ACQ&t=290.52000000000004s)]
