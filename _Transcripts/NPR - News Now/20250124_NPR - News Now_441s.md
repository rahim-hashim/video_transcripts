*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=12.86s)]

*  President Trump's press secretary says the administration has arrested hundreds of people [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  who she says are criminals illegally in the U.S. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=22.04s)]
*  Caroline Levin also says the administration has deported hundreds more by military aircraft. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=25.4s)]
*  Mexico is preparing to receive back its citizens who are deported from the United States. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=32.08s)]
*  For Member Station KJZZ, Nina Kravinsky reports the Mexican government has created a program [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=37.08s)]
*  called Mexico Embraces You. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=42.56s)]
*  Mexico is setting up nine centers along the border with the U.S. to provide medical attention, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  food and shelter to Mexican citizens who are deported. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=49.72s)]
*  There will be at least one shelter in each of Mexico's six border states. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=53.52s)]
*  That includes one in Tijuana, south of California, one in Ciudad Juarez, south of Texas, and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  one in Nogales, south of Arizona. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=62.2s)]
*  Buses will be available to transport people from the border to those centers and from [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=64.8s)]
*  the centers to their home states. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=68.84s)]
*  President Claudia Sheinbaum says the country will welcome Mexicans required to leave the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=71.36s)]
*  U.S. with open arms. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=75.08s)]
*  According to the Pew Research Center, about four million of the 11 million immigrants [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  in the U.S. illegally in 2022 were from Mexico. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=81.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Nina Kravinsky in Hermosillo, Mexico. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=85.2s)]
*  A federal judge in Washington state has temporarily blocked Trump's executive order on birthright [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=89.08s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=94.52s)]
*  The president is seeking to eliminate that right for some Americans. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=95.6s)]
*  The federal judge says that is blatantly unconstitutional. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=99.28s)]
*  Trump says that ruling will be challenged. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=102.72s)]
*  Obviously we'll appeal it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=104.72s)]
*  They put it before a certain judge in Seattle, I guess, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=106.44s)]
*  And there's no surprises with that judge. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=111.16s)]
*  Many states and cities are suing President Trump, saying the president does not have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=114.52s)]
*  the right to overturn the U.S. Constitution. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=118.8s)]
*  President Trump's nominee to be defense secretary has passed a procedural vote in the Senate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=122.28s)]
*  Pete Hegseth appears on track to win Senate confirmation, possibly today. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=126.8s)]
*  Separately, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs has won approval from [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=131.36s)]
*  a Senate committee. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=135.64s)]
*  NPR's Quill Lawrence reports this came as many members of the VA's staff have been [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=136.64s)]
*  exempted from a new federal hiring freeze. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=141.48s)]
*  Doug Collins, an Air Force Reserve colonel and former Georgia congressman, was endorsed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  by the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee 18-to-1, almost guaranteeing he'll be the next secretary [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  of Veterans Affairs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=153.57999999999998s)]
*  During his confirmation hearing this week, he was pressed on whether President Trump's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=155.32s)]
*  federal hiring freeze would apply to VA. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=159.0s)]
*  He said he needed to study it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  In the meantime, doctors and nurses nationwide who thought they had VA job offers got the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=162.92s)]
*  news their offers were rescinded. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=167.88s)]
*  After two days of mixed messages, the administration has now exempted the majority of health care [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=170.04s)]
*  positions at VA from the hiring freeze. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=174.92s)]
*  Senate Democrats have urged Trump to protect all VA staff positions from the freeze. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Quill Lawrence, NPR News. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=182.44s)]
*  The Trump administration has revoked security protection for former Secretary of State Mike [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=183.64s)]
*  Pompeo and former Iran envoy Brian Hook. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=188.56s)]
*  As NPR's Ryan Lucas reports, this comes after President Trump decided to pull the security [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=192.6s)]
*  detail for his one-time national security adviser, John Bolton. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=197.72s)]
*  A person familiar with the situation told NPR the administration pulled the security [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=202.2s)]
*  protection for Pompeo and Hook on Wednesday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, Brian Hook and John Bolton had received security details from the U.S. government [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=209.32s)]
*  because of threats from Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=214.28s)]
*  Iranian officials have publicly stated they want to avenge the death of Qasem Soleimani, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=216.56s)]
*  an Iranian general who was killed in a U.S. drone strike during Trump's first term in office. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=221.12s)]
*  The Justice Department charged an Iranian national in 2022 with plotting to kill Bolton. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=226.64s)]
*  Iran also has plotted against Trump and the Biden administration beefed up Trump's security [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  this past summer in light of those threats. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=236.98s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  Crime rates continue to fall in many parts of the U.S. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=242.64s)]
*  New data from a sample of 40 cities offer early insight into possible national trends. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=246.0s)]
*  NPR's Meg Anderson has more. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=251.88s)]
*  Researchers looked at more than a dozen offenses, including homicide, sexual assault, robbery, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=254.28s)]
*  motor vehicle theft and burglaries. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=259.04s)]
*  Shoplifting was the only one that increased in 2024 compared to the year before by around [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=262.24s)]
*  14 percent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=267.76s)]
*  Ernesto Lopez, a senior research specialist at the Council on Criminal Justice, says shoplifting [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=269.72s)]
*  likely has increased, but preventing it has also become an intense focus of both police [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=275.76s)]
*  and retailers. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=282.28s)]
*  So that really suggests that it's possible there's an increase in reporting and an increase [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=283.96s)]
*  in detection. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  The study found violent crime, on the other hand, fell dramatically. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=291.08s)]
*  Most of those crime rates are now at or below their pre-pandemic levels. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=295.12s)]
*  Meg Anderson, NPR News. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=299.76s)]
*  A new study shows that adults who are diagnosed with ADHD live shorter lives than people without [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  a diagnosis, and Piers Maria Godoy has more. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  The study looked at more than 30,000 adults diagnosed with ADHD in the U.K. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  The researchers used national data on mortality rates to estimate their life expectancy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=316.42s)]
*  They found that men diagnosed with ADHD were dying seven years younger on average compared [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=321.92s)]
*  to their counterparts without a diagnosis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=326.8s)]
*  Women with ADHD lived an average of nine years less. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=329.44s)]
*  Prior research has found that factors including smoking, sleep, exercise, nutrition, and risky [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  driving are key factors behind the shorter lifespans in adults with ADHD. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=337.4s)]
*  Researchers say these factors are linked to impulsivity, which can be treated. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=342.84s)]
*  The findings are in line with other research that finds untreated ADHD raises the risk [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=347.58s)]
*  of serious health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=352.02s)]
*  Maria Godoy, NPR News. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=356.32s)]
*  A pause on pandas that has been unbearable for some is finally over. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=358.72s)]
*  Two giant pandas are now available for public viewing in the nation's capital. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=364.04s)]
*  NPR's Amy Held reports they are on a 10-year loan from China. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=368.6s)]
*  Bao Li and Qing Bao are out of quarantine and in the spotlight. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  After a three-month wait and an 8,000-mile trip from China, they now stand or clumsily [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=377.72s)]
*  climb or roll around ready to make their public debut at the Smithsonian National Zoo. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=382.56s)]
*  Their return after China recalled earlier furry ambassadors marks a reboot of panda [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=388.4s)]
*  diplomacy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=393.28s)]
*  For those who can't make it to DC, the panoply of panda antics is on digital display via [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=394.32s)]
*  the giant panda cam. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  People are bamboozled by the roly-poly big-eyed cuteness. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=401.08s)]
*  Such clips have drawn in millions of viewers. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=404.84s)]
*  China's also loaned two other giant pandas to the US, both at the San Diego Zoo, as a [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  gesture of goodwill. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  Seems panda appeal is pretty black and white. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VikArGNkk8&t=414.15999999999997s)]
