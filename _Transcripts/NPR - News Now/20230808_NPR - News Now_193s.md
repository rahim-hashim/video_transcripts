# Zoom Backtracks On Using Customer Data To Train AI Tools After Outcry | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY)
*  A federal judge has dismissed former President Donald Trump's defamation countersuit against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=0.0s)]
*  writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=5.82s)]
*  And Zoom is scrapping plans to use customer data to train its AI tools. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=7.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  I'm Nora Rahm with NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  President Biden is on a three-state swing through the Western U.S. NPR's Windsor Johnston [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=18.94s)]
*  reports the president is starting his trip today in Arizona. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=24.18s)]
*  Biden is expected to announce plans for a new national monument to preserve 1 million [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=28.26s)]
*  acres during a stop today at the Grand Canyon. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=33.42s)]
*  From Arizona, Biden will then head to Albuquerque, New Mexico to make another pitch for his [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=37.06s)]
*  economic agenda. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=42.72s)]
*  On Thursday, Biden will travel to Salt Lake City, Utah to mark one year since Congress [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=44.58s)]
*  passed the Bipartisan Pax Act, which provides benefits to U.S. service members who were [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=49.86s)]
*  exposed to toxic substances. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=55.5s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=58.24s)]
*  A federal judge has dismissed former President Donald Trump's defamation countersuit against [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=65.68s)]
*  NPR's Jacqueline Diaz has more. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=67.68s)]
*  Trump and his attorneys had claimed that the author and former magazine writer defamed [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=70.16s)]
*  Trump when she said he raped her on CNN. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=74.64s)]
*  When she said this, Carroll was being interviewed after she won one of her lawsuits against [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=78.8s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=82.84s)]
*  The jury in that case found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=83.84s)]
*  In dismissing Trump's countersuit, federal judge Lewis Kaplan said Carroll's statements [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=89.64s)]
*  repeating the claim that Trump had raped her were substantially true. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=94.66s)]
*  This latest development means that an upcoming January 15th trial and a previous lawsuit [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=99.2s)]
*  filed by Carroll against Trump will continue. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=104.36s)]
*  Jacqueline Diaz and PR News. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=108.16s)]
*  Experts at Zoom say the company does not use customer data to train its artificial [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=111.08s)]
*  intelligence tools. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=116.14s)]
*  As NPR's Bobby Allen reports, the announcement comes after reports that Zoom uses what people [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  say on video calls to advance its AI. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=123.94s)]
*  Tech bloggers recently discovered that Zoom quietly updated its terms of service to say [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  that Zoom reserves the right to train its AI on customers' video, audio, and chat transcripts [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=131.0s)]
*  without explicit permission. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=135.84s)]
*  After a backlash from customers, Zoom went on the defensive, saying in a statement that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=137.96s)]
*  it would not use customer data to improve its AI without consent. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=142.28s)]
*  But critics point out that Zoom has a poor track record on data privacy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=146.32s)]
*  Zoom was criticized in 2020 after providing end-to-end encryption only to customers who [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=149.68s)]
*  paid for the service. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=154.34s)]
*  A year later, the company agreed to a $85 million settlement over sharing customer data [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=155.52s)]
*  with Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn without consent. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=160.16s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  The polls are open in Ohio in a special election. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=165.32s)]
*  Voters are deciding whether to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution and to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=168.68s)]
*  impose more stringent standards to get an amendment on the ballot in the first place. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=173.84s)]
*  Abortion rights activists oppose the changes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=178.92s)]
*  In November, voters in Ohio are to consider a proposed constitutional amendment to protect [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=181.68s)]
*  access to abortion in the state. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=187.12s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LIPePQNQVY&t=189.76s)]
