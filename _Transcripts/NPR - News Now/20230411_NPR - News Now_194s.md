# Expelled Tennessee Lawmaker Reinstated | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8)
*  Five people have now died from a shooting at a Louisville bank yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=0.0s)]
*  And the National Metro Council has voted to reinstate one of the Tennessee [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=3.88s)]
*  lawmakers expelled from the statehouse last week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=7.84s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Cora Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=11.36s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=14.02s)]
*  Five people have now died from a shooting at a bank yesterday in Louisville, Kentucky. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=16.36s)]
*  Eight people remain hospitalized, including one Louisville [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=20.66s)]
*  police officer who was critically injured. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=23.86s)]
*  Daylon Riggs was able to escape the building during the shooting. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=26.58s)]
*  I just walked right past the conference room where everyone was. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=30.04s)]
*  And then I came down and I had to grab something. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=35.08s)]
*  And then on my way back up to the elevator, I just hear this loud. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=37.12s)]
*  I thought there was like something that dropping because they were doing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=41.46s)]
*  some construction or some renovations in there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=43.66s)]
*  And I got up there and the guy was like, run, there's a shooter. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=46.06s)]
*  Louisville police killed the gunman who was a bank employee. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=49.1s)]
*  He was 25 years old. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=53.06s)]
*  Four days after the Tennessee Democrat [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=55.04s)]
*  Justin Jones was expelled from the statehouse, the Nashville Metro Council [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=57.08s)]
*  has voted to reinstate him from member station WPLN. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=61.54s)]
*  Cynthia Abrams reports Jones and another black democratic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=65.22s)]
*  lawmaker were expelled after participating in a gun control [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=68.88s)]
*  protest on the statehouse floor. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=72.36s)]
*  In addition to a unanimous vote reinstating Justin Jones, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  council members elected to suspend a month long waiting period to fill the seat. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=78.42s)]
*  Nashville Metro Council member Sandra Sepulveda [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=82.92s)]
*  thanked her constituents for speaking up. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=85.52s)]
*  I know that a lot of the community members called and emailed us. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=87.92s)]
*  And I think they did a great job because we didn't have a single objection [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=91.36s)]
*  to suspension of the rules today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=96.24s)]
*  Justin Jones will now serve in the statehouse on an interim basis, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=97.84s)]
*  pending a special election. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=101.3s)]
*  The Shelby County Board of Commissioners will consider receding Justin Pearson, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=103.3s)]
*  the other expelled lawmaker on Wednesday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Cynthia Abrams in Nashville. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=110.44s)]
*  Some states are stockpiling the abortion medication Mifepristone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=113.28s)]
*  This comes after a federal judge in Texas ruled the drug was wrongly approved by the FDA. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  The Justice Department has appealed that decision. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=122.48s)]
*  The agency points to another federal judge's ruling in Washington state [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=125.18s)]
*  that says the FDA needs to keep the drug on the shelves. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=129.58s)]
*  The Justice Department says the two rulings appear to be in conflict. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=132.66s)]
*  A new report finds the last U.S. census may have undercounted Asian Americans [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=136.96s)]
*  in certain states and some rural counties. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=141.72s)]
*  As NPR's Hansi Lo Wong reports, those undercounts would have long term effects [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=144.22s)]
*  on political representation and federal funding. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=149.06s)]
*  The Census Bureau announced last year that its headcount in 2020 [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=152.3s)]
*  had a national overcount of Asian Americans driven by counting residents [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=155.3s)]
*  more than once at different addresses. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=159.44s)]
*  But a new report by the advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, AAJC, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=161.54s)]
*  finds potential undercounts of the Asian populations in seven states, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=166.62s)]
*  including Alaska, Iowa, and New Hampshire, as well as rural counties [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=170.62s)]
*  in the Midwest, Mountain West, and the South. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=174.56s)]
*  When any group is under or overcounted in the census, the communities where they live [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=176.92s)]
*  face the risk of not getting their fair share of representation in government [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=181.16s)]
*  and of federal money for health care, transportation, and other public services. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=184.94s)]
*  Hansi Lo Wong, NPR News. This is NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTDKZXOUYG8&t=189.0s)]
