# Oregon Under A State Of Emergency As Recovery Continues | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs)
*  Good morning. Today is Thursday, January 18th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=2.84s)]
*  Most of Gaza has been without cell phone or internet service for almost a week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  As NPR's Jeff Brumfield reports, the United Nations says the prolonged blackout puts more lives at risk. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=10.88s)]
*  The problem began when a fiber optic cable linking Gaza to Israel and the West Bank was cut. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=17.16s)]
*  Paltel, the local service provider, blamed quote, ongoing aggression for the outage. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Late last week, two of its workers were killed trying to make repairs in an area where Israeli forces are battling with Hamas militants. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=26.8s)]
*  Juliet Tuma is with the UN. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=33.96s)]
*  She says the lack of communications is hindering the distribution of food and other supplies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=36.28s)]
*  For aid operations and to coordinate the delivery of assistance, it's extremely difficult not to have a phone line. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=41.52s)]
*  The head of a Palestinian cell phone company tells NPR that efforts to repair the line continue, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=48.64s)]
*  but must be carefully coordinated with the Israeli military to avoid further loss of life. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=53.92s)]
*  Jeff Brumfield, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=60.0s)]
*  Winter storm advisories stretch across a swath of the U.S. from Washington state to the Carolinas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  At least 36 people have been killed in several states by the weather. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=68.04s)]
*  Oregon is recovering from an ice storm. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=71.92s)]
*  From member station KLCC in Eugene, Nathan Wilk reports, Oregon Governor Tina Kotec declared a state of emergency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=74.44s)]
*  Starting Saturday, freezing rain and ice toppled power lines in Lane County. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=82.48s)]
*  Although temperatures have risen, local utility providers say it may be a week or more until power is fully restored. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=87.96s)]
*  One customer, Julie Morris, is living in a motel while she waits, but she says she can't afford to stay there much longer. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Being a single mom, it's scary. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=103.64s)]
*  All of our food went to waste at home in the fridge. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=105.6s)]
*  You know, I can't even get my car out of the driveway. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=108.08s)]
*  So I just I honestly I don't know what to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=110.0s)]
*  Kotec has now ordered state agencies to assist the recovery effort and seek federal aid. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=113.08s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Nathan Wilk in Eugene, Oregon. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=119.48s)]
*  Republican candidates are stumping in New Hampshire ahead of next week's primary election. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu is strongly backing former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=128.0s)]
*  She's going to do well. We always wanted to have a strong second. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=133.88s)]
*  That's the only expectation we ever laid out there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=136.48s)]
*  Some polling suggests Haley is gaining support in New Hampshire, but still trails former President Donald Trump. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump says Haley is a poor choice if Republicans want to win back control of Congress. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=145.16s)]
*  A vote for Nikki Haley this Tuesday is a vote for Joe Biden and a Democrat Congress this November, because that's what's going to happen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump and Haley's rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, has turned to South Carolina for more votes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=157.56s)]
*  He hopes to win the state away from Trump and Haley, the former governor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=164.67999999999998s)]
*  The South Carolina Republican primary is set for February 24th. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=168.76s)]
*  However, the Democratic primary is set for February 3rd. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=173.16s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAtfGRLBjs&t=178.27999999999997s)]
