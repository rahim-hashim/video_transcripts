*  night's Grammy Awards. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=10.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=12.02s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=13.02s)]
*  Here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=14.6s)]
*  A small bipartisan group of senators has unveiled a proposed measure to deal with immigration [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=16.28s)]
*  at the southern U.S. border. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=20.6s)]
*  Among other features, it also provides aid to Israel and Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=22.240000000000002s)]

*  While Speaker Mike Johnson says it won't even come up for debate in his chamber, Connecticut [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=27.8s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy was the lead Democratic negotiator on the bill. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=32.18s)]
*  He told MSNBC Republicans want to fan chaos at the border. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=36.32s)]
*  Speaker Johnson would sort of love to let this issue lie. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=40.8s)]
*  He would love for there to continue to be chaos at the border so that Donald Trump has [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=44.64s)]
*  a political advantage. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLnPzLqXUyE&t=47.84s)]
