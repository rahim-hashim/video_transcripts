*  uncommon near Reagan National Airport. And Piers Robert-Manacasa reports the FAA says [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=29.44s)]
*  it's recorded dozens of near misses and many involve military helicopters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  An NPR analysis of the Federal Aviation Administration's data on rare near mid-air [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=40.16s)]

*  enforcement. And Piers, Kerry Johnson has more. He says he wants to focus on fighting terrorism [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=84.32s)]
*  and violent crime, preventing the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs, and to give the good cops [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=89.11999999999999s)]

*  ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas has released the names of three Israeli hostages. It says it will release [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=139.76s)]
*  Saturday. One is 65 year old dual American Israeli Keith Siegel. His wife Aviva, a former hostage, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  told NPR last year how she'd react when he'd be freed. I think I'll scream and just jump on him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=151.44s)]
*  I can't wait. Two other men on the list to be freed Saturday include a 35 year old father. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=160.16000000000003s)]

*  under 21. And Piers Martin Costey reports. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=187.76s)]
*  which covers Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, has ruled that a 1968 federal age restriction [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=192.0s)]
*  is unconstitutional. The law barred people under 21 years of age from buying handguns from federally [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  licensed dealers. But the constitutionality of that kind of gun control became less certain [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=203.84s)]
*  after a 2022 Supreme Court decision known as a Bruin, which says such laws must be consistent [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  with American history and tradition. That's the basis of this ruling in the Fifth Circuit, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=215.2s)]
*  which cites the 1792 Militia Act, which requires 18 year olds to bear arms. It's not clear yet how [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=220.16s)]
*  this decision will affect gun sales nationally, and gun control groups say they hope it will be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=227.6s)]
*  overturned. Martin Costey, NPR News. I'm Janene Herbst, NPR News in Washington. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxSmOfXV_ZQ&t=232.48s)]
