# Rep. Lauren Boebert Wins Colorado GOP Primary | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, June 26th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=3.0s)]
*  The founder of the online whistleblowing site WikiLeaks has returned to his native Australia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=7.0s)]
*  Julian Assange was released from detention in London after he reached a plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=12.0s)]
*  He is pleaded guilty to a single count of espionage for publishing classified U.S. material. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=18.0s)]
*  Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had worked for his release. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=24.0s)]
*  One of the things that my government does is at times as well we don't shout, we're not in a contest of machismo. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=28.0s)]
*  What we do is we get things done. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=37.0s)]
*  And my government advocated strategically, patiently, in a calibrated way, and we achieved this outcome. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=40.0s)]
*  Assange had been jailed for five years in Britain. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=47.0s)]
*  He'd spent seven years before that hiding in the Embassy of Ecuador in London. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=50.0s)]
*  Biden has issued a blanket pardon to troops expelled from the U.S. military for their sexuality. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=55.0s)]
*  NPR's Quill Lawrence reports the action will affect thousands of veterans. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=61.0s)]
*  In a statement, Biden said he was writing a historic wrong by granting clemency to all troops in the past 60 years who were court-martialed, quote, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=65.0s)]
*  simply for being themselves. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=73.0s)]
*  The exact number expelled for their sexuality or gender identity isn't known. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=75.0s)]
*  Commanders often used other infractions to push gay troops out or offered a less than honorable discharge in lieu of court-martial. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=79.0s)]
*  This pardon will remove a huge obstacle for thousands of veterans to get their military discharge upgraded, but that is still a long and difficult process. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=86.0s)]
*  The Department of Veterans Affairs, by contrast, has a quicker path to grant VA benefits if veterans can show they were kicked out for their sexuality. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=94.0s)]
*  Quill Lawrence, NPR News. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=102.0s)]
*  Two-term Congressman Jamal Bowman was defeated in yesterday's Democratic primary in New York. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=104.0s)]
*  Westchester County Executive George Latimer beat Bowman in a race highlighting party divisions over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=109.0s)]
*  Bowman has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=117.0s)]
*  Latimer was backed by Jewish leaders and pro-Israeli groups. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=122.0s)]
*  In Colorado, incumbent Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert won the GOP primary in a district that is separate from her current one. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=126.0s)]
*  From Colorado Public Radio, Andrew Kenney has more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=134.0s)]
*  Well, she has a history. She's definitely a bulldog in terms of trying to get things done. She's pro-Trump. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=157.0s)]
*  You know, she's doing the right things to help our country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=165.0s)]
*  The fourth is heavily conservative, so Boebert is expected to have a clear path to reelection from here. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=168.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Andrew Kenney in Windsor, Colorado. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=174.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUBkNFcQwNI&t=177.0s)]
