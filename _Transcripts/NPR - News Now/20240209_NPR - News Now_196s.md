# Biden Responds To Questions About His Age, Memory | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8)
*  President Biden won't face charges for his mishandling of some classified documents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=0.0s)]
*  And Firefox news host Tucker Carlson conducted a two-hour interview with Russian President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Vladimir Putin last night. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=12.16s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=13.16s)]
*  President Biden won't face charges for mishandling some classified documents. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=17.76s)]
*  But the U.S. special counsel investigating him criticized Biden's mental acuity in his [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=22.36s)]
*  final report. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=27.28s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid reports that Biden held a press conference last night to try to contradict [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=28.76s)]
*  that impression. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=34.08s)]
*  The report describes Biden as a, quote, sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=35.32s)]
*  The president responded. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=41.36s)]
*  I'm well-meaning and I'm an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=42.36s)]
*  I've been president and I put this country back on its feet. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=46.2s)]
*  Biden was defensive as reporters asked him blunt questions like, is your memory getting [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=49.0s)]
*  worse? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=54.08s)]
*  He's 81 and he often mixes up people and names. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=55.08s)]
*  It even happened last night when he was responding to a question about Israel in Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=57.72s)]
*  Polls have repeatedly shown many voters are concerned about the president's age. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=61.88s)]
*  Biden's likely opponent in the presidential election is Donald Trump, who at 77 also faces [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=66.36s)]
*  questions about his mental sharpness. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=72.0s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=74.88s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday about whether former President Donald [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=76.88s)]
*  Trump should be excluded from Colorado's primary ballot. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=81.84s)]
*  The Colorado state Supreme Court says he should be disqualified because his actions around [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=86.0s)]
*  January 6th amount to insurrection. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=91.24s)]
*  Several U.S. justices, both liberal and conservative, questioned whether that should happen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Gary Johnson says some of the justices are worried about the repercussions of Colorado's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  potential action. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=105.83999999999999s)]
*  The chief justice brought up the idea of other states engaging in some tit for tat, maybe [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  blocking the Democratic front runner from the ballot by arguing he engaged in an insurrection. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=112.36s)]
*  But the lawyer for Colorado voters said that shouldn't be a worry. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  This part of the Constitution, he said, has been dormant for 150 years because nothing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=121.36s)]
*  like January 6th has happened. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=125.8s)]
*  NPR's Carrie Johnson reporting. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=127.8s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow is open to negotiations that could see the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=130.28s)]
*  release of jailed Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=135.24s)]
*  Putin's comments came in a lengthy interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=140.08s)]
*  NPR's Charles Mains reports from Moscow. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=144.8s)]
*  Tucker Carlson's two-hour interview with Putin saw the Russian leader make familiar false [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  justifications for his invasion of Ukraine, yet it also provided Putin's most extensive [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=152.36s)]
*  comments to date on the arrest of Wall Street Journal correspondent, Evan Gershkovich. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=157.28s)]
*  When asked by Carlson if he would free Gershkovich as a gesture of his decency, Putin demurred, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=161.8s)]
*  noting negotiations with the U.S. were ongoing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=167.0s)]
*  He then suggested Moscow could be open to a trade that included a suspected Russian [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=169.86s)]
*  government assassin currently serving a life sentence for murder in Germany. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  Putin also insisted Gershkovich had been caught red-handed gathering intelligence for the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=178.06s)]
*  U.S. Secret Services. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=182.34s)]
*  Gershkovich, the journal, and the U.S. government all vehemently reject that charge. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=183.9s)]
*  Charles Mains, NPR News, Moscow. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaejjHBtLX8&t=188.18s)]
