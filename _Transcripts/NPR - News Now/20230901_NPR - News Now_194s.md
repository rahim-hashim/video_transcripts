# Florida Communities Prepare For Delayed Flooding | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA)
*  Some Florida residents are preparing for the possibility of delayed flooding from Hurricane [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=0.0s)]
*  Adalia. And Georgia's governor is dismissing requests by former President Donald Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=4.8s)]
*  to start impeachment proceedings against the Fulton County District Attorney. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=10.16s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Kristen Wright with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=14.08s)]
*  The water is still rising in parts of the southeastern U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=18.72s)]
*  two days after Hurricane Adalia made landfall. In west central Florida, many Pasco County residents [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=22.32s)]
*  are ready to begin recovery efforts. The storm flooded thousands of homes along the coastline. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  But as Gabriella Paul from member station WUSF reports, emergency officials are warning [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  communities are not in the clear yet. Pasco's assistant director of emergency [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=39.36s)]
*  management Laura Wilcoxon says people should expect delayed flooding events through Saturday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=43.68s)]
*  She says the county's topography is shaped like a bowl, making it easy for water to overflow into [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  the river system below. Even 24 to 72 hours post a hurricane passing our area will start to accumulate [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=54.0s)]
*  the rainfall and other flooding from the communities that are north of us. She says that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=60.96s)]
*  the Ann Clote and the Pithlitch-Oscote rivers always are prone to delayed flooding after major [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=65.2s)]
*  storms. National Weather Service forecasts say the Ann Clote could swell another four feet, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=69.68s)]
*  but that would still be several feet under the designated 20-foot flood stage. For NPR News, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm Gabriella Paul. Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=79.2s)]
*  charges he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. The plea came as Governor [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=83.36s)]
*  Brian Kemp rejected calls to start impeachment proceedings against Fulton County District Attorney [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=88.96s)]
*  Fonny Willis, who brought the case against Trump and 18 others. Kemp says he sees no evidence [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=94.48s)]
*  Willis violated her oath of office. In Georgia, we will not be engaging in political fear [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=100.16s)]
*  that only inflames the emotions of the moment. We will do what is right. We will uphold our [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=106.4s)]
*  as public servants and it's my belief that our state will be better off for it. A judge has yet [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=113.84s)]
*  to set a trial date for Trump. Just in time for Labor Day, the Labor Department is set to report [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=120.16s)]
*  on the nation's job market. NPR's Scott Horsley reports forecasters think employers added about [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=126.0s)]
*  170,000 jobs last month. Forecasters think the pace of hiring has slowed compared to the beginning [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=133.28s)]
*  of the year, but employers are still adding a respectable number of jobs each month and the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  unemployment rates expect to remain historically low, around three and a half percent. Other [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=142.64s)]
*  indicators do point to a cooling job market. Job openings have declined, though there are still [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  three vacancies for every two unemployed workers, and the number of workers quitting jobs has come [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=153.04s)]
*  down, so employers aren't having to deal with quite so much turnover. Today's report is also [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=158.48s)]
*  expected to show that wage growth slowed in August, but in a turnaround, wages are now climbing faster [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=163.27999999999997s)]
*  than prices, so workers have seen real improvement in their buying power. Scott Horsley, NPR News, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=169.36s)]
*  Washington. Ahead of the Labor Day weekend, gas prices are holding fairly steady, falling only a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  penny since last week to a national average of 382 a gallon for regular. AAA points out that impact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  assessments are still being made from Hurricane Edalia. You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkfDm2tCOsA&t=188.0s)]
