# 100 Days In, Trump Targets His Opponents, Perceived Enemies | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ)
*  Today marks President Trump's 100th day in office, and a fire has damaged the historic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Clayborn Temple, a civil rights landmark in Memphis, Tennessee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=5.22s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Kori Vo Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=9.78s)]
*  A new NPR-PBS News Marist poll is taking the measure of President Trump's first 100 days [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=14.18s)]
*  in office. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=19.3s)]
*  NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports many Americans say they're not pleased with what they're [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=20.3s)]
*  seeing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=24.84s)]
*  1,400 people were reached by telephone, online, or by text, and they were asked to grade Trump's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=25.84s)]
*  first 100 days in office. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=30.8s)]
*  The top answer was an F. 45% of respondents gave Trump the failing mark. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=32.72s)]
*  About half that, 23%, gave him an A. 80% of Democrats and 49% of independents gave Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=37.96s)]
*  an F. 54% of Republicans, meanwhile, gave him an A. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=43.82s)]
*  Trump has just a 42% approval rating in the poll overall, the second worst score for a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=47.96s)]
*  president's first 100 days in 80 years of polling, the lowest, Trump, in 2017, when [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=52.84s)]
*  he was just a point lower. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  Domenico Montanaro, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  A new NPR analysis has found that President Trump has targeted more than 100 opponents [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=66.12s)]
*  and perceived enemies in his first 100 days in office. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Tom Dreisbach has more. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=75.28s)]
*  The Trump administration has used government power against a wide range of targets, including [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=77.44s)]
*  law firms, universities, media organizations and student protesters. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=81.72s)]
*  Trump has also personally ordered criminal investigations into former officials he considers [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=87.16s)]
*  disloyal. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=92.08s)]
*  Sean Brennan is a former federal prosecutor who was fired for prosecuting people who attacked [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=93.64s)]
*  the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=98.6s)]
*  I was retaliated against for taking actions that were well within the law, but that were [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=101.0s)]
*  politically unfavorable to the people in charge. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=107.4s)]
*  The White House maintains that Trump is ending the weaponization of government while also [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=110.28s)]
*  getting accountability. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=114.68s)]
*  Tom Dreisbach, NPR News. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration will ease the effects of its tariffs on American automakers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=118.24s)]
*  The move, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as Trump prepares for a rally [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=122.52s)]
*  tonight outside of Detroit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=126.7s)]
*  And Piers Danielle Kurtz-Levin has more. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=128.72s)]
*  The new policy is designed to keep American automakers from paying multiple of Trump's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=130.86s)]
*  new tariffs simultaneously. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  For example, carmakers wouldn't have to pay the 25% steel and aluminum tariff on top of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=137.44s)]
*  a 25% auto parts tariff taking effect later this week. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=142.52s)]
*  An administration official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the policy to NPR, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=146.76s)]
*  though the administration has not yet released detailed information. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=151.8s)]
*  In a statement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said a goal is, quote, providing runway [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=155.46s)]
*  to domestic manufacturers, giving them time to invest in more domestic plants. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=160.44s)]
*  Danielle Kurtz-Levin, NPR News. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=165.16s)]
*  NPR has learned two employees of the government cost-cutting entity DOGE have been given accounts [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=167.4s)]
*  on classified networks used to send nuclear secrets. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brumfield has more. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=176.48s)]
*  Two sources told NPR that the DOGE employees had appeared in a user directory for the classified [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  networks. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=183.8s)]
*  Their names are Adam Ramada and Luke Ferritor. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=184.8s)]
*  Ramada is a Miami-based venture capitalist. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=187.68s)]
*  Ferritor is a 23-year-old former intern at SpaceX. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=190.4s)]
*  Neither seems to have much experience with either nuclear weapons or classified information. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=194.68s)]
*  The networks are used at the Department of Energy to transfer restricted data about nuclear [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=199.8s)]
*  weapons designs and materials. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  It's unclear why Ramada and Ferritor would need the access, though DOGE has been reviewing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=207.32s)]
*  budgets and contracts across government. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  An Energy Department spokesperson acknowledged the accounts were created but said they were [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  never used to access the networks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  Jeff Brumfield, NPR News. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=220.24s)]
*  Canadian voters have chosen Mark Carney as the country's prime minister. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=223.0s)]
*  They cast ballots yesterday in what is seen as the most consequential election in Canada [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=226.6s)]
*  in decades. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=231.76s)]
*  As NPR's Jackie Northam reports, Carney beat an opponent whose policies were seen as similar [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=233.0s)]
*  to President Trump's. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  Carney entered the political race at a time when Canadians were angry over Trump placing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=240.04s)]
*  stiff tariffs on the country and threatening to make Canada the 51st state. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=244.32s)]
*  The 60-year-old Carney has a Wall Street background and was head of the Bank of England and the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=249.28s)]
*  Bank of Canada, and so was seen as having the chops to take on Trump. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=254.08s)]
*  His main opponent, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poliev, was seen as too closely aligned [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=258.72s)]
*  with Trump's policies on immigration, shrinking government and ending wokeism. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=263.76s)]
*  Still, it wasn't a landslide for Carney and his Liberal Party. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=268.32s)]
*  He'll likely have to create a coalition government. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=272.44s)]
*  Jackie Northam, NPR News. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=275.24s)]
*  A fire has damaged a civil rights landmark in Memphis, Tennessee. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  The historic Claiborne Temple was the staging ground for striking sanitation workers during [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=282.36s)]
*  their iconic I Am a Man campaign. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=287.48s)]
*  NPR's Debbie Elliott reports that campaign drew the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=290.64s)]
*  to Memphis, where he was later assassinated. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=296.04s)]
*  Claiborne Temple has been a stately fixture in downtown Memphis for more than 130 years. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=299.0s)]
*  It's heartbreaking to see one of the nation's greatest treasures lost to this fire. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=305.16s)]
*  Memphis Mayor Paul Young. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=314.0s)]
*  History was made in this building. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=315.8s)]
*  It has been the epicenter of the civil rights movement. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=319.24s)]
*  Claiborne Temple AME was where labor activists and civil rights leaders, including the Reverend [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=322.04s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr. met to strategize in 1968 when Memphis sanitation workers went [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=327.32s)]
*  on strike over deadly working conditions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  The cause of the fire is under investigation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  Debbie Elliott, NPR News. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=340.04s)]
*  Illinois State Police say yesterday's deadly car crash near Springfield does not appear [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=342.44s)]
*  to be an intentional act. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=346.92s)]
*  A motorist drove a car into a building that was hosting an after-school program for students. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=349.12s)]
*  Three children and a young adult were killed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  Erica Joe was a witness. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=356.8s)]
*  She says the vehicle smashed all the way through the building. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=358.68s)]
*  There's a perfect entry hole and a perfect exit hole, almost like a bullet wound would be. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=362.8s)]
*  Authorities say the driver has not been identified and was taken to a hospital for evaluation. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=369.6s)]
*  The U.S. Navy says an incident at sea that resulted in the loss of a fighter jet is being [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  investigated and NPR's Giles Snyder reports the jet slipped off the hangar deck of an aircraft carrier. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=380.24s)]
*  The Navy says the incident happened in the Red Sea aboard the USS Harry Truman, which [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=386.8s)]
*  has been involved in launching airstrikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=391.8s)]
*  In a statement, the Navy says sailors were towing an F-A-18E Super Hornet into place [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=396.44s)]
*  when they lost control and the jet fell overboard, along with a small towing tractor. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=401.76s)]
*  One sailor sustained a minor injury. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=406.64s)]
*  The Houthi rebels claim to have launched an attack on the carrier group and there are [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=408.94s)]
*  reports the Truman made a hard turn to evade Houthi fire. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=412.64s)]
*  But it's unclear if that contributed to what happened, and the Navy says the Truman strike [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=416.76s)]
*  group remains fully mission capable. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=420.72s)]
*  Super Hornets cost at least $60 million each. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  Giles Snyder, NPR News. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=426.12s)]
*  The Trump administration is threatening to again close the border to cattle crossing [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=428.16s)]
*  from Mexico. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=431.92s)]
*  This happened for months last year. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=433.16s)]
*  That was after authorities detected a flesh-eating parasite called the New World Screw Worm [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=434.82s)]
*  and a cow in southern Mexico. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=440.48s)]
*  From member station KJZZ, Nina Kravinsky has more. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=442.72s)]
*  Last November, Mexican and U.S. officials worked together to put in place new protocols [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  for cattle imports into the United States, leading to a lengthy border closure for the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=450.76s)]
*  livestock. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=455.0s)]
*  Now, President Trump's Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, has sent a letter urging Mexico [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=456.0s)]
*  to lift restrictions on USDA-contracted aircraft fleets that she says are equipped to fight [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=460.92s)]
*  the parasite, or her department will close the border again. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=466.6s)]
*  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum implied that this latest measure was politically motivated. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  What we're saying is that they can't use Mexico as a piñata, Sheinbaum says. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swkfcuo2GSQ&t=477.24s)]
