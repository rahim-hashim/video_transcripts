# U.S., Ukraine Sign Long-Stalled Deal Over Rare Earth Minerals | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0)
*  The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a deal to share profits from Ukraine's critical minerals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal judge has ruled that Apple has violated an order in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=4.8s)]
*  Fortnite's antitrust case against the big tech company. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=8.48s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=12.08s)]
*  The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a deal to share profits from Ukraine's critical minerals. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  The arrangement gives the Trump administration an incentive to keep [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=20.48s)]
*  investing in Ukraine's defense against Russia and in its reconstruction. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=23.6s)]
*  President Trump has been demanding the deal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=27.68s)]
*  And we made a deal where our money is secure, where we can start digging and doing what we have to do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=30.08s)]
*  It's also good for them because you'll have an American presence at the Cyprus, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=38.24s)]
*  and the American presence will, I think, keep a lot of bad actors out of the country or certainly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=42.64s)]
*  out of the area where we're doing the digging. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=48.8s)]
*  But the agreement does not provide explicit U.S. security guarantees that Ukraine has been demanding. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=50.64s)]
*  Money from the investment fund can be used to pay for new military aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=56.48s)]
*  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has ended a mortgage rescue program for veterans. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  NPR's Quill Lawrence reports housing industry experts fear that thousands of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=67.44s)]
*  vets and their families will face foreclosure. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=72.24s)]
*  The Department of Veterans Affairs set up the VA Service Purchase Program, or VASP, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=75.12s)]
*  to correct an error with the home loan program during the Biden administration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  that left tens of thousands of veterans facing foreclosure through no fault of their own. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=83.6s)]
*  In the less than six months it was up and running, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  VA says VASP saved at least 17,000 veterans from losing their homes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=90.96s)]
*  But Republicans in Congress oppose VASP because it has VA buy up the troubled loans. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  There is a bill in the House to replace it with a different program, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  but there's no saying when that might make it into law. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=104.24s)]
*  The VA has now ended VASP despite groups like the Mortgage Bankers Association [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=106.96s)]
*  warning it would lead to thousands of foreclosures. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=111.92s)]
*  Quill Lawrence, NPR News. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=114.8s)]
*  A federal judge has ruled that big tech company Apple has violated a court injunction in an [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  antitrust case. The lawsuit was filed by the parent company of the game Fortnite. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=122.0s)]
*  The federal judge had ordered Apple to lower barriers for its once exclusive [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=127.36s)]
*  in-app digital transactions and Apple was supposed to let developers show links to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=132.56s)]
*  alternatives to those in-app transactions. The federal judge told Apple to stop blocking her [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=137.84s)]
*  order. Senate Democrats have failed to pass a resolution to effectively block President [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=143.6s)]
*  Trump's global terrorists and Piers Elena Moore reports three Republican senators joined Democrats [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=148.96s)]
*  in supporting the measure. The failed Senate resolution marked a rare moment of some bipartisan [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=155.12s)]
*  opposition towards Trump, but not enough. Republican Susan Collins was one of the senators who supported [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=160.56s)]
*  it. Before the vote, she told reporters she wanted to send a message. We really need to be far more [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=166.72s)]
*  discriminatory in imposing these tariffs and not treat allies like Canada the way we treat adversaries [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=172.72s)]
*  like China. Collins joined a small group of four Republicans in pushing back against Trump's tariffs [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=182.0s)]
*  on Canadian imports. Despite passing in the Senate, that resolution stalled in the House. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=187.68s)]
*  Elena Moore, NPR News, The Capitol. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=193.28s)]
*  The Trump administration is moving to terminate one billion dollars for school mental health grants. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=195.44s)]
*  The education department says the grants conflict with the Trump administration's priorities. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=201.2s)]
*  These grants were part of a gun violence bill passed in Congress. It allows schools across [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=206.24s)]
*  the country to hire more psychologists, counselors, and social workers. Harvard University says it has [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=211.28s)]
*  provided information on international students to the Department of Homeland Security. From [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=218.0s)]
*  Member Station GBH in Boston, Kirk Karapeska reports administrators are not saying what [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=223.6s)]
*  information was turned over. Here's what we do know. The Trump administration had demanded that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  Harvard turn over detailed records for all foreign students' illegal and violent activities or lose [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  the right to enroll any international students. In a message sent to the campus community, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=241.68s)]
*  Harvard executive VP Meredith Wienich says the school responded to the request from DHS [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=247.04s)]
*  without saying what exactly was shared. Wienich reiterates Harvard's, quote, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=252.72s)]
*  steadfast commitment to international scholars, urging them to stay focused on their academics. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=257.28s)]
*  Last week, Harvard announced it was suing the administration over this and other demands. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=263.6s)]
*  But now some faculty and students question the school's commitment to push back. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=268.64s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Kirk Karapeska in Boston. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=273.68s)]
*  The Trump administration is tapping more federal agencies to help carry out its immigration [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=276.32s)]
*  enforcement policies. According to the Washington Post, that includes using law enforcement [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=281.36s)]
*  officers with the U.S. Postal Service. The Postal Service has not replied to NPR's request for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=286.8s)]
*  comment. A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security says the Trump administration [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=292.72s)]
*  will use all available resources to secure the border. Former Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=298.0s)]
*  delivered a major speech last night in San Francisco. From Member Station KQED, Scott Schaefer [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=304.32s)]
*  reports she blasted President Trump's actions during his first 100 days in office. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=309.76s)]
*  This was Harris's first major speech since she and Joe Biden left office in January. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=315.44s)]
*  Speaking to Emerge America, a political group that helps elect Democratic women, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=320.32s)]
*  Harris said the Trump administration is counting on fear to divide the country [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=324.48s)]
*  while implementing a far-right agenda. Instead of an administration working to advance [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=336.0s)]
*  The California Democrat is reportedly considering a run for governor next year, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=345.92s)]
*  a campaign that would surely take her out of the next presidential election. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=349.92s)]
*  She made no mention of either in her remarks. For NPR News, I'm Scott Schaefer in San Francisco. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=353.84s)]
*  The use of nicotine pouches nearly doubled among American teens between the years 2023 and 24. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=359.6s)]
*  NPR's Maria Godoy reports on a new survey of more than 10,000 high schoolers across the country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=366.24s)]
*  The researchers asked teens about their use of electronic cigarettes, vapes, and nicotine [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  pouches, small, easily concealed sachets of nicotine that are placed between the lip and gum. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=377.44s)]
*  They found that in 2024, more teens reported using nicotine pouches as well as using both [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=383.84s)]
*  pouches and e-cigarettes compared to 2023. Meanwhile, the share of teens vaping decreased [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=390.23999999999995s)]
*  over the same time period. The long-term health effects of nicotine pouches aren't known, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  but they do carry the risk of nicotine addiction. Prior studies suggest exposure to nicotine during [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  adolescence may harm brain development. The research appears in the journal JAMA Network Open. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve3yQftvbj0&t=407.92s)]
