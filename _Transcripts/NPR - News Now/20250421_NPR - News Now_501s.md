**NPR - News Now:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU)
*  Pope Francis died today at the age of 88. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=0.0s)]
*  And four congressional Democrats landed in El Salvador this morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=3.7s)]
*  They're demanding the return of a man illegally deported by the Trump administration last [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=7.2s)]
*  month. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  There's word from the Vatican this morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=16.7s)]
*  Pope Francis has died at his residence at the age of 88. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=18.34s)]
*  The pope's death comes one day after Christians celebrated Easter Sunday around the world. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=21.78s)]
*  NPR's Silvia Puggioli reports Francis was the first non-European pope in about a thousand [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=31.480000000000004s)]
*  Jorge Maria Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Italian immigrants. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  He was the first Jesuit to become pope, the first to take the name of Saint Francis of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=37.18s)]
*  Assisi, and the first pope from the global south. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=41.300000000000004s)]
*  Francis was beloved for his common touch and his vision of a merciful and inclusive church. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  He described it as a field hospital after battle, healing the wounds of the faithful [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=50.02s)]
*  and going out to find those who have been hurt, excluded or fallen away. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=54.6s)]
*  A firm believer in the need to save the planet, Francis was not afraid to criticize Western [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=59.2s)]
*  societies for what he called their unfettered pursuit of money. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=64.12s)]
*  He also made many enemies within the church for his efforts to reform and clean up the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=68.16s)]
*  Vatican bureaucracy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=73.24s)]
*  Silvia Puggioli, NPR News, Rome. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=75.24s)]
*  When a pope dies, there are official procedures that are followed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=78.3s)]
*  It ranges from announcing his death to electing a new head of the Roman Catholic Church. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=82.04s)]
*  And Piers Jason DeRose explains the process. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=87.08s)]
*  After a pope dies, a series of Vatican officials gets word before the death is announced to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=90.22s)]
*  the public. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=94.24s)]
*  The pope's funeral is usually scheduled within the next four to six days, allowing cardinals [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=95.3s)]
*  time to travel to Rome. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=99.36s)]
*  Then, between 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, all cardinals under the age of 80 enter [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  a conclave held in the Sistine Chapel behind sealed doors. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=105.9s)]
*  They participate in four rounds of balloting every day until someone receives two-thirds [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=109.76s)]
*  of the vote. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=113.76s)]
*  The ballots of the final vote are burned with a special chemical to produce white smoke, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=114.76s)]
*  announcing to the world the conclave has chosen the new head of the Roman Catholic Church. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  Jason DeRose, NPR News. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=124.48s)]
*  Four members of Congress landed in El Salvador this morning demanding the release of Quilmar [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=126.72s)]
*  Obrego-Garcia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  He is the immigrant illegally deported from Maryland to El Salvador last month. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  Lawmakers' trip comes just days after U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen unsuccessfully tried [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=137.52s)]
*  to bring Obrego-Garcia back to the United States. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  And Piers Luke Garrett has more. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=146.12s)]
*  Representatives Robert Garcia of California, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Yasamin Ansari of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon all flew to El Salvador Monday. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=152.44s)]
*  The group of Democrats said they hoped to return Obrego-Garcia to the U.S. by pressuring [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=156.38s)]
*  the White House to quote abide by a Supreme Court order. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=160.46s)]
*  The Trump administration continues to fight the Supreme Court order to facilitate the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=164.1s)]
*  man's return. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=167.5s)]
*  Earlier, the White House admitted it deported Obrego-Garcia due to a quote administrative [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=168.5s)]
*  error. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=172.66s)]
*  Representative Dexter of Oregon called the man's case a quote constitutional crisis. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=173.66s)]
*  Last week, Representatives Garcia and Frost asked for congressional funding for trip security [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=178.4s)]
*  and travel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=182.94s)]
*  The Kentucky Republican Representative James Comer rejected the request. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  Luke Garrett, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=187.85999999999999s)]

*  Obrego-Garcia's illegal deportation to El Salvador. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=195.46s)]
*  Louisiana U.S. Senator John Kennedy says he will watch President Trump's response to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=199.46s)]
*  court orders. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=204.10000000000002s)]
*  And Piers Luke Garrett reports. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  Senator Kennedy told NBC News Obrego-Garcia never should have been sent to El Salvador. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=207.5s)]
*  Look, this was a screw up in my opinion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  The administration won't admit it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  Kennedy also said Obrego-Garcia should have received a hearing before his wrongful deportation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=216.34s)]
*  to El Salvador in prison. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=220.62s)]
*  But when asked whether he believes Trump is in defiance of a court order to facilitate [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=222.26s)]
*  the man's return, Kennedy said, I don't believe that President Trump will defy a federal judge's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=225.86s)]
*  order. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=231.78s)]
*  If he does, I'll call him out on it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=232.78s)]
*  And Kennedy called Trump's proposal of sending Americans to El Salvador not quote appropriate [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=235.22s)]
*  or moral. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=239.86s)]
*  Luke Garrett, NPR News, Washington. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=240.86s)]
*  As the Trump administration negotiates trade deals with other countries, China has issued [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=243.78s)]
*  a warning. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  NPR's John Rewich reports the warning is against any agreements that harm Chinese interests. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=249.78s)]
*  China's Commerce Ministry says it respects the efforts of others to try to resolve trade [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=255.5s)]
*  disputes with the U.S. through consultation, but it warns that it will take corresponding [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=259.06s)]
*  countermeasures if any deals are struck at the expense of China's interests. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=263.58s)]
*  It did not give details. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=267.84s)]
*  The comments come after reports that President Trump is hoping to use tariff negotiations [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=269.46s)]
*  with other countries to isolate China. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=273.36s)]
*  At the same time, Trump has said he wants to do a deal with Beijing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=275.7s)]
*  This month, he raised the base tariff on Chinese imports to a dizzying 145 percent. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=278.94s)]
*  China responded in kind with high tariffs on U.S. goods. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=284.74s)]
*  The Chinese Commerce Ministry says seeking tariff exemptions by harming the interests [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=288.48s)]
*  of others will only lead to failure on both sides and ultimately hurt everyone. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=291.98s)]
*  John Rewich, NPR News, Shanghai. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=296.9s)]
*  The White House is denying a New York Times report that says Defense Secretary Pete Hegsel [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=299.44s)]
*  shared sensitive information in a second chat on the messaging app Signal. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=304.36s)]
*  The White House says the information was not classified. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  NPR has not confirmed the information in the Times report. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=311.48s)]
*  It said Hegsel shared information about a military strike in Yemen with family members [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  and his lawyer. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=320.16s)]
*  This comes after a different chat on the same topic included a journalist by mistake. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=321.56s)]
*  Thousands of protesters turned out at hundreds of events over the weekend in the U.S. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=326.76s)]
*  They gathered to protest President Trump's policies. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  Others demonstrated at Tesla showrooms in the U.S. to oppose Tesla CEO Elon Musk. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=334.34s)]
*  He's been overseeing Trump's government cost-cutting entity Doge. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  NPR's Juliana Kim reports there are more protesters turning out. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=343.38s)]
*  A hallmark of this protest movement is that demonstrators are joining together with a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=347.62s)]
*  long and varying list of grievances. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=351.94s)]
*  You know, it's immigration, it's federal funding cuts, foreign policy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=354.64s)]
*  It's too soon to tell how long the momentum will last, but researchers at Harvard's crowd [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=358.26s)]
*  counting consortium said in a Guardian op-ed that between January 22nd and the end of March, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=363.06s)]
*  street protests have more than doubled compared to the same time frame eight years ago. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=369.14000000000004s)]
*  NPR's Juliana Kim reporting. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  Russia's Defense Ministry says it has resumed military operations in Ukraine following an [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=376.18s)]
*  Easter Day ceasefire. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=381.22s)]
*  The decision comes after the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had not ordered an [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=383.18s)]
*  extension of the unilateral truce, which struggled to hold. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=387.48s)]
*  NPR's Charles Maines has more from Moscow. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=391.58s)]
*  In a statement, Russia's Defense Ministry acknowledged a lessening of intensity of Ukrainian [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  military activity across the front line Easter Sunday, but still accused Kiev of carrying [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  out thousands of attacks on Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=403.44s)]
*  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy countered that Russia had created the impression of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=407.86s)]
*  a ceasefire but continued artillery and assaults on the front lines. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=411.41999999999996s)]
*  Yet with the formal end of the ceasefire window, Russia immediately resumed airstrikes on its [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=415.44s)]
*  neighbor. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  The renewal of attacks came despite appeals from the Trump administration to extend the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=420.54s)]
*  truce as the White House has expressed growing frustration over lack of progress in U.S.-backed [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=424.18s)]

*  Palestinian medics last month in Gaza. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=437.74s)]
*  The report says it found professional failures. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=440.5s)]
*  Israel had claimed that the medics' vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=443.74s)]
*  opened fire. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqyPO7KIRJU&t=448.3s)]
