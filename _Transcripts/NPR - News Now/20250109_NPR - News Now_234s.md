# Winds Continue To Fan California Fires Through Friday | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno)
*  Good morning. Today is Thursday, January 9th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=0.0s)]
*  Firefighters in Los Angeles continue to battle several major wildfires, the most destructive in the region's history. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=7.04s)]
*  At least five people have died. More than 2,000 homes and other structures have burned. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=12.84s)]
*  NPR's Adrienne Florido reports the winds fanning those flames are forecast to continue into tomorrow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=18.12s)]
*  Those winds have made it extremely difficult for firefighters to gain control of the two biggest blazes, the Palisades Fire on the west side of LA, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=23.96s)]
*  and the Eaton Fire on the east side. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=32.12s)]
*  They've each reduced whole neighborhoods to ash and forced tens of thousands of people to flee. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=34.36s)]
*  Overnight, a new fire in the Hollywood Hills grew quickly, forcing chaotic evacuations there and threatening iconic Hollywood landmarks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=40.4s)]
*  LA Mayor Karen Bass said fire crews are being brought in from other counties and states. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=48.72s)]
*  The fierce winds that fanned the flames earlier this week have subsided, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=53.84s)]
*  but are expected to pick up again, meaning the risk of fires spreading and new ones popping up remains high. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=58.1s)]
*  Adrienne Florido, NPR News, Los Angeles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=63.96000000000001s)]
*  The memorial service for former President Jimmy Carter begins later this morning at the Washington National Cathedral. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=66.44s)]
*  Since Tuesday, his body has lain in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=72.64s)]
*  Amelia Carnell came to pay her respects. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  She says she is honoring Carter not only for his work in the White House, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=79.84s)]
*  but for his global humanitarian work afterwards with the Carter Center. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=83.12s)]
*  I think his legacy is really his time after his presidency that he shows that like he obviously reached the highest office in the land, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=87.4s)]
*  but then went on to still fight for causes he believed in. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=97.68s)]
*  This is a national day of mourning for Carter. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=101.68s)]
*  U.S. government offices are closed and there won't be any delivery of regular mail. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=104.4s)]
*  A federal appeals court is considering whether to halt a plea agreement that would let the mastermind of the September 11th terror attacks, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=109.84s)]
*  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, avoid the death penalty. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=116.64s)]
*  This follows efforts by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to block the plea deal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=119.56s)]
*  Austin's effort was overruled by two U.S. military courts. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=124.44s)]
*  NPR's Sasha Pfeiffer has more. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  This complicated legal situation began when Secretary Lloyd Austin reversed plea deals [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=130.28s)]
*  reached with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and three co-defendants last summer. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=135.92s)]
*  But a Guantanamo judge ruled Austin cannot do that retroactively, so the plea deals should go forward. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  Austin appealed and lost. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=147.32s)]
*  He now wants a federal court to block the pleas. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=149.32s)]
*  Former military commission attorney Ian Moss says by not accepting deals, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=152.44s)]
*  the government is squandering a chance to end a case considered hopelessly gridlocked. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=157.4s)]
*  This is essentially snatching victory from the jaws of self-defeat. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=162.0s)]
*  After so long with no to minimal progress, there's finally an opportunity to have closure. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=165.96s)]
*  If guilty pleas are halted, the 9-11 case could continue for years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  Sasha Pfeiffer, NPR News. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=176.36s)]
*  Girl Scouts USA says it is retiring two cookie flavors. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  But NPR's Neda Ulubi reports the Girl Scouts beloved top selling cookies are still available. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Do not worry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Your thin mints and your peanut butter patties are safe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=190.52s)]
*  The two flavors being discontinued are ones you may not even have heard of. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=193.72s)]
*  Toast Yeas have a French toast flavor and Scout S'mores are based on the classic campfire treat. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  They were introduced in 2021 and 2017 respectively. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  They will disappear from the Girl Scout lineup after the season. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=208.12s)]
*  Oh my God, this tastes like childhood. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=211.44s)]
*  Alexis Gibson loved the Toast Yeas cookies when she reviewed them on TikTok in 2023. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=213.84s)]
*  Dozens of Girl Scout cookie varieties have been introduced and retired since the Scouts [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=219.6s)]
*  first started selling them nationally in the 1920s. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=224.28s)]
*  Neda Ulubi, NPR News. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=227.96s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7BCpPXxno&t=231.24s)]
