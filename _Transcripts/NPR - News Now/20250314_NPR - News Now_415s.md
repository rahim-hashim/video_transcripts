# S&P 500 Enters 'Correction Territory' Amid Angst Over Tariffs | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI)
*  House Democrats are livid as Senate Democrats appear poised to help Republicans to pass a spending bill and avert a partial federal government shutdown. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=0.0s)]
*  And Dr. Mehmet Az's Senate confirmation hearing is today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=8.6s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=12.6s)]
*  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has done a 180 and now says he will vote for the Republican-backed government spending bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=17.1s)]
*  Earlier, he'd said he'd opposed it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  If Congress fails to pass the spending bill, the government will probably partially shut down late tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=25.4s)]
*  Schumer says that would give President Trump the power to eliminate more federal workers and declare whole agencies are not essential. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=31.4s)]
*  And Pierce Georgia Walsh says Democrats are furious about this choice. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=39.5s)]
*  It does not look like we are heading towards a shutdown. Democrats are not happy with this bill. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=43.7s)]
*  It was written without their input, but enough are expected to join with Republicans later today and pass it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=48.2s)]
*  Since the House passed the bill on Tuesday largely along party lines, Senate Democrats have been debating and really agonizing about what to do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=54.4s)]
*  Do they help Republicans avoid a shutdown or block the bill and trigger one? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  They say both options are terrible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=66.6s)]
*  And Pierce Georgia Walsh reporting, House Democratic leaders say they still oppose this bill. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=68.5s)]
*  President Trump's choice to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will appear for his Senate confirmation hearing today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=75.0s)]
*  Dr. Mehmet Oz will likely be questioned about his financial interests in health care companies. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=82.5s)]
*  And PR Selena Simmons Duffin has more. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=88.1s)]
*  Dr. Mehmet Oz is a medical doctor, a cardiothoracic surgeon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=90.7s)]
*  He first became famous as a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=94.8s)]
*  That led to a radio show and daytime TV's The Dr. Oz Show. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=98.0s)]
*  He built his fame and fortune by promoting alternative therapies like unproven diet products, cleanses and detoxes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=102.3s)]
*  If confirmed, his boss will be Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who Oz knows and featured as a guest on his TV show. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=109.6s)]
*  Oz appears before the Senate Finance Committee and Democrats on the panel are expecting to challenge him on his financial ties to health companies and his plans for the future of Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=118.6s)]
*  CMS has an enormous budget of one point five trillion dollars per year and provides health coverage for nearly half the population. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=129.3s)]
*  Selena Simmons Duffin and PR News Washington. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=138.0s)]
*  Two federal judges have now ordered the Trump administration to rehire thousands of probationary federal workers that have been fired. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=141.3s)]
*  Both judges found the administration told the workers they were being let go for poor performance. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=148.4s)]
*  Instead, they found that these were reductions in force that had nothing to do with the employees work. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=153.7s)]
*  And as Chris Arnold says, one federal judge in California declared the Trump administration was telling a lie. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=159.3s)]
*  The judge called the mass firing a sham to get around statutory requirements. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=165.5s)]
*  And he said that the administration exceeded its authority by having one office in the government direct so many other agencies to just summarily fire all these workers. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=170.8s)]
*  NPR's Chris Arnold reporting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=179.6s)]
*  The Trump administration has already moved to appeal the decision. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=181.6s)]
*  The Trump administration is going to the U.S. Supreme Court to push its demand to limit birthright citizenship. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=185.9s)]
*  This right is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=191.7s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order trying to deny U.S. citizenship to people born in this country, to parents without legal status or parents who are legal permanent residents. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=195.0s)]
*  NPR's Nina Totenberg has more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=206.2s)]
*  Three federal judges blocked the Trump order in cases brought in Washington state, Maryland and Massachusetts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=208.5s)]
*  And three separate appeals courts refused to unblock those court orders. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=215.2s)]
*  In each case, the court issued a universal injunction, meaning that the Trump plan has been blocked throughout the country. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  So the administration went to the Supreme Court asking the justices to allow them to at least begin preparing for implementation of the ban on automatic birthright citizenship. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=237.1s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin says that he backs the general idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine, but he wants a lot of things before he'll agree to one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=239.89999999999998s)]
*  U.S. officials are trying to persuade Putin to accept a 30 day truce. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=249.0s)]
*  Ukraine has already agreed to this, but a Putin aide says Ukraine first has to give up territory and then promise that it will never join NATO. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=253.2s)]
*  The Dow and the Nasdaq plunged yesterday. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=262.8s)]
*  The S&P 500 index has lost so much value recently that it's now in what's called correction territory. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=265.4s)]
*  This comes after President Trump imposed a variety of tariffs on foreign goods. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=272.4s)]
*  NPR's Tamara Keith reports Trump used to celebrate stock market gains, but is not doing so now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=276.8s)]
*  Trump used to boast about the way the markets rose on news of his election and how people's 401Ks were doing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=283.3s)]
*  This past weekend on Fox News, he was asked about falling stock values. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=291.0s)]
*  You can't really watch the stock market. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=295.6s)]
*  Former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore says Trump always has his eye on the markets. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=298.90000000000003s)]
*  He does care about people's 401K plans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=304.8s)]
*  He does want a booming stock market. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  And so obviously there's some agitation about what's been going on in the last couple of weeks with this steep fall in stock prices. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  The slide has coincided with Trump's on again, off again tariff threats. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  On that, the president says he's not going to bend at all. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=324.2s)]
*  The Federal Aviation Administration says an engine on a passenger plane caught fire yesterday in Denver. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=326.2s)]
*  Airport officials say the plane was flying from Colorado Springs to Dallas when it diverted to Denver. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=332.1s)]
*  The jet's engine caught fire after it landed. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=338.1s)]
*  Everyone escaped, but 12 people were sent to the hospital with minor injuries. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  An American social media influencer sparked outrage in Australia after posting a video of herself. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=345.8s)]
*  She was snatching a wild baby wombat from its mother. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  Christina Kukljow reports the video prompted swift reaction from animal rights groups and Australian leaders. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=356.4s)]
*  The video shows the woman taking the wombat from its mother on a dark roadside and running away towards someone laughing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=363.2s)]
*  An online petition called for her to be deported. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=370.9s)]
*  Officials confirmed that the woman known online as Sam Jones left Australia voluntarily as a review into a possible breach of her visa conditions was ongoing. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=374.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned her actions. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  And you know, I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  Jones returned the baby marsupial moments after taking it, but it's unclear if it was reunited with its mother. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  She has since apologised. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Christina Kukljow in Melbourne, Australia. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srgq7gPYQwI&t=408.20000000000005s)]
