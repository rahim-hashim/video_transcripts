*  New tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico are now in effect. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=0.0s)]
*  And Ukraine is drafting plans to defend itself without U.S. assistance [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  after President Trump suspended all U.S. military aid to that country. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=9.22s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=13.82s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=16.46s)]
*  President Trump's threats to impose across-the-board tariffs on Canada and Mexico [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=18.36s)]
*  became reality overnight. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=22.46s)]
*  He imposed 25 percent tariffs on them and a fresh 10 percent tariff for China. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  Trump says it's to stop these countries from illegally sending fentanyl into the U.S. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=29.16s)]
*  NPR's Brian Mann has more. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=33.9s)]
*  In a statement explaining new tariffs that go into effect today, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=35.84s)]
*  the White House again pointed to drugs and fentanyl as a key rationale, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=38.34s)]
*  describing overdose deaths in the U.S. as a national emergency [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=42.72s)]
*  and saying other countries have failed to adequately address drug smuggling. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=45.96s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau punched back, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=50.32s)]
*  saying fentanyl smuggling from Canada is, quote, near zero. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=52.92s)]
*  Chinese officials, meanwhile, say they've already stepped up drug interdiction efforts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=56.68s)]
*  A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry described the fentanyl issue [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=61.12s)]
*  as a pretext for new tariffs. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=64.42s)]
*  Both countries say they'll retaliate with new tariffs on U.S. goods. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=66.66s)]
*  This trade fight comes as deaths from fentanyl are dropping fast in the U.S., [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=70.36s)]
*  down more than 30 percent over the last year, according to federal researchers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=74.4s)]
*  Brian Mann, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=78.86s)]

*  at least in the short term. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=90.78s)]
*  Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  said the PAS feels like betrayal from Ukraine's strongest single ally. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=97.78s)]
*  When you deprive a country of capabilities and weaponry to defend itself, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  it inevitably has tragic consequences in terms of human lives. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  So I didn't believe that it would happen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=111.80000000000001s)]

*  NPR's Claudia Grisales says he is expected to demand that lawmakers move on a huge bill [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=136.9s)]
*  featuring his priorities. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=142.6s)]
*  Now Trump wants to put the squeeze on Republicans to move very quickly on getting a partisan bill out of Congress [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=144.6s)]
*  that would install another series of massive changes from $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=151.0s)]
*  It's an extension of a program installed during his first term, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=157.54s)]
*  as well as a dramatic $2 trillion in cuts to federal spending that has some worried about Medicaid cuts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=160.5s)]
*  And before they can even get to all of that, they have to address a government shutdown deadline. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=167.2s)]
*  NPR's Claudia Grisales reporting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usxn2wueqGg&t=171.98s)]
