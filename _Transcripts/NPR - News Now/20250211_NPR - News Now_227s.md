*  According to Jordanians and White House officials, Trump floated that plan last week [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=36.12s)]
*  for the U.S. to take over Gaza and forcibly push 2 million Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=40.56s)]

*  and therefore would be seen as a declaration of war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=64.92s)]
*  Trump says the U.S. should take control of Gaza, saying the war-torn enclave is like a big real estate site. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=67.92s)]
*  A federal judge is extending the hold on the Trump administration's resignation offers to federal employees. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=75.44s)]
*  Yesterday was the deadline for some 2 million civilian workers to choose whether to resign [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=81.56s)]

*  A group of unions representing thousands of federal workers say the offer is unlawful [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=93.36s)]
*  and aims to replace career civil servants with people ideologically aligned with Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=98.16s)]
*  Government attorneys reject those claims and say the unions lack standing to challenge an administrative action. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=103.16s)]
*  Union attorney Elena Goldstein praised the extension. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  We hope that this decision today will provide civil service workers with the assurance that the American people have their backs [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=113.0s)]
*  and we will continue to pursue all legal options to ensure that they are protected and that the law is upheld. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sgwTHmj08Q&t=120.4s)]
