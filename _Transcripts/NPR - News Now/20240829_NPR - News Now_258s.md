*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=14.92s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=15.92s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump shared a video on social media Wednesday that included footage [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=22.0s)]
*  of Arlington National Cemetery. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=27.48s)]
*  It raises questions about whether it violates federal law against using military cemeteries [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=30.04s)]
*  for campaign purposes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=35.52s)]
*  The video appeared after NPR reported that members of Trump's campaign got into a physical [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=37.9s)]
*  altercation on Monday with a cemetery staffer who tried to reinforce the restriction. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=43.92s)]

*  for his videographer and photographer to document the emotional moment. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=62.48s)]
*  It's also important to note the family members who invited Trump also spoke at the Republican [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=66.64s)]
*  National Convention. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=70.7s)]
*  Even though they were okay with the cameras, the families don't have the power to suspend [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=71.7s)]
*  the rules. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=75.4s)]
*  The Trump campaign says the Arlington representative was quote, suffering from a mental health [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=76.4s)]

*  The Supreme Court has rejected the Biden administration's latest attempt to proceed with canceling [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=84.68s)]
*  some student debt. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=90.76s)]

*  The Biden administration's saving on a valuable education or SAVE plan has been riddled with [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=98.88s)]
*  challenges about its legality. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=103.88s)]
*  As it moved through the court system this summer, borrowers were already put in forbearance [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=106.4s)]
*  while the legal fight played out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=110.52s)]
*  SAVE is a revamped version of the long-troubled income-driven repayment plan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=113.04s)]
*  It now has at least 7.5 million Americans enrolled and has already delivered loan forgiveness [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=117.36s)]
*  to nearly 360,000 borrowers as of mid-May. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=123.76s)]
*  Now the high court is bumping the matter back to the lower courts, leaving its fate uncertain. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=128.68s)]
*  Janet Oujang-Lee, NPR News. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=134.8s)]
*  NVIDIA, the closely watched chip company, reported blockbuster earnings on Wednesday. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=137.48s)]
*  But as NPR's Maria Aspin reports, it couldn't live up to Wall Street's impossible hype. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=143.28s)]
*  NVIDIA reported sales of $30 billion in the last three months. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  That's better than analysts expected and more than double its sales a year earlier. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=154.0s)]
*  Profits also more than doubled to more than $16 billion. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  The chip company is reaping the benefits of the AI boom. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  Giant tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=166.0s)]
*  are all investing billions of dollars in AI. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=170.88s)]
*  And NVIDIA provides the semiconductors that power this hot technology. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=174.24s)]
*  But with outsized performance comes outsized expectations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  Investors have sent NVIDIA's share price soaring since the beginning of the year. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=182.44s)]
*  Now it seems they're worried that the AI bubble could be starting to deflate. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=186.68s)]
*  Maria Aspin, NPR News, New York. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  A new study looks at the effects of asthma inhalers on the environment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Scientists say the inhalers have a high climate impact because they use powerful greenhouse gases. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=200.16s)]
*  NPR's Alejandra Burunda reports on the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=207.04s)]
*  Millions of people with asthma in the U.S. use inhalers that puff medicine into their lungs. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=213.64s)]
*  That puff comes from types of gases called hydrofluorocarbons. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=218.68s)]
*  They're super potent greenhouse gases that can be up to a thousand times as powerful as carbon dioxide at trapping heat. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=222.24s)]
*  Jyothi Tirumalasetty is a doctor and researcher at Stanford. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=228.44s)]
*  She led a new study that shows the climate impact of the inhalers prescribed to Medicare and Medicaid patients across the country is enormous. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=232.0s)]
*  It's like a city the size of Milwaukee that we can power for one whole year. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  But she says there's a lower impact alternative, dry powder inhalers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  Those work just as well for many patients. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  Alejandra Burunda, NPR News. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=251.68s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5KjOuDadpM&t=253.88s)]
