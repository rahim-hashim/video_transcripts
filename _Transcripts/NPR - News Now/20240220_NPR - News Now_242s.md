# Russia Blocks The Release Of Alexei Navalny's Body | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw)
*  Russian authorities continue to block the release of Alexei Navalny's body. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=0.0s)]
*  And the gunman who killed two police officers and a firefighter in Minnesota over the weekend was barred from owning guns. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=4.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=10.8s)]
*  Russian authorities continue to block the release of the body of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Navalny died last week in a remote Russian prison colony under mysterious circumstances. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=20.8s)]
*  From Moscow, NPR's Charles Maines has more. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=25.8s)]
*  Russia's investigative committee now tells Navalny's family its investigation into the opposition leader's death has been extended for an undetermined period. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=28.6s)]
*  Investigators also say Navalny's body won't be released for at least another two weeks, as agents carry out a quote chemical examination of Navalny's remains. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=36.4s)]
*  Little is known about the circumstances of Navalny's death last Friday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=45.2s)]
*  A statement from Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service at the time said only that medics had failed to resuscitate the opposition leader after he collapsed following a scheduled prison walk. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=49.2s)]
*  Navalny's allies say delays in releasing his remains are part of a government effort to hide evidence of his murder. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=58.0s)]
*  Charles Maines, NPR News, Moscow. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=63.8s)]
*  The U.N. Security Council will take up resolutions today that call for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=66.2s)]
*  The United States is prepared to veto one of them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=71.39999999999999s)]
*  Instead, it has proposed its own. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. draft calls for a pause in fighting, but it's based on the release of hostages still held by Hamas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=76.0s)]
*  It also calls for the lifting of all blocks to humanitarian aid for Palestinians. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=82.4s)]
*  Authorities in Minnesota say a heavily armed man who killed two police officers and a firefighter near Minneapolis last weekend had a criminal record. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  The three were killed as they responded to a call about domestic violence at a home. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=96.0s)]
*  From Minnesota Public Radio, Matt Sepick reports the standoff ended with the death of the gunman. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=100.4s)]
*  Court records show that Shannon Cortez Gooden was prohibited from possessing firearms because of a 2008 felony assault conviction. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=105.6s)]
*  The 38-year-old petitioned a judge unsuccessfully in 2020 to have his gun rights restored. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=113.0s)]
*  In opposing the request, a prosecutor noted that two of Gooden's romantic partners had filed orders for protection against him. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=118.3s)]
*  Gooden fatally shot two police officers and a firefighter paramedic from the suburb of Burnsville. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=125.1s)]
*  Another officer was treated and released. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=130.7s)]
*  Gooden barricaded himself inside a house for hours with seven children ages 2 to 15. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=133.2s)]
*  All survived without physical injury. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Matt Sepick in Minneapolis. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  Two of the nation's largest credit card companies are going to merge. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  Capital One plans to buy Discover Financial in a deal worth about $35 billion. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  Capital One founder and CEO Rich Fairbank explains why Discover is such an attractive financial partner. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  Discover is a big company, but they're the smallest of the four U.S.-based global payment networks. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=161.4s)]
*  And this acquisition will add scale to help it compete with the biggest players. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=169.9s)]
*  The proposed merger will draw a close review from regulators. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=175.5s)]
*  Congress has also been weighing legislation that would boost competition in the credit card business and cut merchant fees. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  NASCAR's season opener has a first-time winner. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=187.8s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder reports that William Byron is celebrating his first career Daytona 500 victory. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=190.5s)]
*  William Byron says he wasn't sure where he stood when the caution flag flew on the final lap, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=197.2s)]
*  but he ended up taking his first Daytona 500 victory. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=202.6s)]
*  It still hasn't sunk in yet, so I feel like it's just kind of a blur. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=205.9s)]
*  And I feel like there's just so many things that have to go your way to win a race like this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=209.7s)]
*  And it's special. I mean, this is the biggest race. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=215.5s)]
*  26-year-old Byron drives for Hendrick Motorsports. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=219.7s)]
*  He's the first Hendrick driver to win the Great American Race since Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2014. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=223.39999999999998s)]

*  Giles Snyder, NPR News. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRWw5omHfDw&t=236.29999999999998s)]
