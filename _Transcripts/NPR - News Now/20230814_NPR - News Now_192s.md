*  president. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=11.1s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=12.1s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=13.1s)]
*  Catastrophic wildfires burning in Maui have left a trail of destruction across the island. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=17.86s)]
*  Officials in Hawaii say an estimated 2,700 homes, businesses and other structures have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=24.46s)]

*  Governor Josh Green says a comprehensive review has begun that will figure out how the fires [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=41.78s)]
*  caught so many by surprise. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=46.24s)]
*  He says winds gusted up to 81 miles per hour and pushed the blaze about a mile a minute [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=48.46s)]
*  through West Maui, with temperatures topping 1,000 degrees. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=53.34s)]
*  Because that level of destruction in a fire hurricane, something new to us in this age [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=57.02s)]
*  of global warming, was the ultimate reason that so many people perished. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=61.5s)]
*  Governor Green says the Federal Emergency Management Agency has more than 400 staff [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=66.02000000000001s)]
*  in Maui, including Administrator Deanne Criswell. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  He says they expect another 35 people from FEMA's urban search and rescue team to arrive [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=73.30000000000001s)]

*  Gabriel Spitzer, NPR News, Maui. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=80.74000000000001s)]

*  Jefferson County Public Schools is trying to avoid a repeat of last week's delays [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=98.78s)]
*  that led some parents to call police over their missing kids. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=103.14s)]
*  That's why the district canceled classes last Thursday and Friday, and then canceled [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=106.98s)]
*  them again. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=110.86000000000001s)]
*  School won't resume until at least this Wednesday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=112.22s)]
*  Superintendent Marty Polio said Friday that they will make improvements. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=114.94s)]
*  There are still going to be challenges, there are going to be delays, we're working in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=118.78s)]
*  the same system, but it's going to be much more efficient and our communication will [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=121.62s)]
*  be much better with families and schools. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=125.78s)]
*  And so we want to make sure we get that right before we put kids back on a school bus again. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=128.34s)]
*  It's possible more school days might be canceled this week. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=132.7s)]

*  The Nigerian government has so far gathered the necessary elements of proof to prosecute [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfNqTyy_0k&t=157.62s)]
