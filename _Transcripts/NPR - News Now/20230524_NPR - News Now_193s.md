*  Harlan Crowe is refusing to cooperate with Democrats' investigation into his gifts to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=5.28s)]
*  a Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  The timeline to resolve the dispute over the nation's debt ceiling is getting very short. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=16.72s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports lawmakers are facing a critical deadline in early June to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=21.48s)]
*  agree and avert a potential federal government default. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=26.44s)]
*  After numerous stops and starts this week, White House and congressional negotiators [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  appear no closer to reaching an agreement. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=35.08s)]
*  House Republicans emerged from a closed-door meeting with Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=38.8s)]
*  pointing a finger at the Biden administration. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  The main sticking point has been how to cap government spending. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=47.44s)]
*  Despite the latest setback, the White House on Tuesday said that talks remain productive. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=51.84s)]
*  When asked by reporters whether there's enough time to get a deal through Congress before [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  June 1st, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said there's a space and an opportunity to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  have a bipartisan, reasonable agreement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=67.84s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=71.04s)]
*  Typhoon Magwar is hitting the U.S. territory of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=73.92s)]
*  The eye will likely slide just above the island in the next few hours, but residents [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=78.36s)]
*  could still get winds of 140 miles per hour. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=83.24s)]
*  Guam's governor, Lutleon Guerrero, says there is damage. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=87.08s)]
*  There are damages of houses. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=90.48s)]
*  We had to initiate a rescue mission. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=92.36s)]
*  Eight people were rescued and now are in the shelter. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=95.12s)]
*  But I will have my first assessment right after the winds start tapering down. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=98.76s)]
*  Biden declared quickly emergency for the island of Guam, which allowed us then to access [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=104.76s)]
*  a lot of resources from FEMA. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=112.44s)]
*  Guam could get as much as 25 inches of rain from the typhoon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=114.68s)]
*  There is a flash flood warning in effect, as well as an extreme wind warning. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=119.12s)]
*  Billionaire Republican mega-donor Harlan Crowe has refused to provide information to the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=124.72s)]
*  Senate Judiciary Committee. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=129.56s)]
*  The lawmakers are examining the ethics of Crowe's gifts to the Supreme Court Justice [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=131.4s)]
*  Clarence Thomas. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Nina Totenberg has more. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=138.0s)]
*  Earlier this month, the committee asked Crowe to provide information about private jet and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=140.52s)]
*  yacht trips, luxury vacations and other gifts that he or his holding companies provided [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  for Justice Thomas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=151.6s)]
*  Thomas did not disclose the gifts and has since said he will rectify the error. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=153.12s)]
*  But the Judiciary Committee wants to know the details of these and potentially other [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=157.88s)]
*  gifts from Crowe. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=161.96s)]
*  Now, however, Crowe, through his lawyer, is refusing to provide any of the requested information, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=163.2s)]
*  contending that Congress has no right to investigate alleged ethical violations or to legislate [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=169.6s)]
*  a Supreme Court code of ethics. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=175.64s)]
*  In response, Durbin said the real estate magnate has no credible legal basis for his refusal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=177.88s)]
*  Unspoken, the threat of a subpoena. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=184.6s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuOMZJ2RyI&t=187.28s)]
