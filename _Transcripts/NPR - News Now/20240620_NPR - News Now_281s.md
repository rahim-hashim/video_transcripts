*  Things are getting tense between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah on the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhXyoM2hVw&t=16.16s)]
*  border. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhXyoM2hVw&t=20.56s)]
*  Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah says they don't want to go to war, but he warned that's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhXyoM2hVw&t=21.56s)]
*  what the current fighting could lead to. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhXyoM2hVw&t=26.48s)]
*  And he says they have drone footage with detailed images of possible targets in Haifa, Israel's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhXyoM2hVw&t=28.72s)]
*  major port city. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhXyoM2hVw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  And here's Janene Raff has more from Lebanon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhXyoM2hVw&t=35.120000000000005s)]
