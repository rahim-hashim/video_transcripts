*  And testimony continues today in the trial of the father of a 2021 Michigan school shooter. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=5.44s)]

*  headquarters in Brussels. He says his country is exactly where it needs to be. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=28.24s)]
*  With this membership, Sweden has come home. Home to the security cooperation of democracies, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=33.28s)]
*  home to the security cooperation of our good neighbors. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=41.04s)]
*  But Sweden's path to membership was difficult. All NATO members need to agree to accept a new [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=44.64s)]
*  country, and Sweden was blocked for nearly two years by Hungary and Turkey. Turkey approved [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=49.68s)]

*  where more than a million Palestinians are sheltering, is a red line for the U.S., [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=77.68s)]
*  one that Israel must not cross. You cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead, said the President. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=82.08s)]
*  The U.S. has been asking Israel for an evacuation plan for civilians in Ra'afah, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=88.96s)]

*  doesn't happen again. Diye Parvaz, NPR News, Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, the U.S. is starting to send [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=110.0s)]
*  materials to build a temporary pier off Gaza. This will be used to deliver more humanitarian [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=116.24s)]
*  aid to Palestinians. President Biden announced news of the pier during last week's State of the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=122.24s)]
*  Union address. Testimony continues today in the trial of James Crumbly. He is the father of the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=127.76s)]

*  violent picture the teen drew featuring a gun like the one his father had just bought him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=154.24s)]
*  The prosecution claims the elder Crumbly never locked the gun. His wife was convicted a month [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=158.8s)]
*  ago on identical charges, but Crumbly's defense paints him as a more sympathetic figure and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=163.68s)]
*  encounters that he hid the gun from his son. Another side of Crumbly came to light during [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=169.12s)]
*  the trial when a judge restricted who he communicates with because he made threats on a jailhouse phone [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=173.52s)]
*  and in an electronic message. The sanction was delivered while the jury was not present to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXnHCJEcRyw&t=178.4s)]
