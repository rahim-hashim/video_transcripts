**NPR - News Now:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk)
*  A London-bound Air India flight crashed shortly after takeoff today in Western India. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=0.0s)]
*  And the IAEA has declared that for the first time in 20 years, Iran is not complying with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  its nuclear obligations. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=10.98s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=13.02s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=14.02s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=15.5s)]
*  There's been a major plane crash in Western India today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=17.26s)]
*  An Air India flight with 242 passengers and crew crashed shortly after takeoff. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=20.0s)]
*  They were bound for London. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Diya Hadid reports from Mumbai, local police say it appears everyone aboard has [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=27.18s)]
*  been killed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=32.38s)]
*  Footage shared by the outlet Press Trust of India showed the plane sinking over a residential [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=33.38s)]
*  quarter of the Western Indian city of Ahmedabad and then the sound of a blast and a ball of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=37.82s)]
*  fire. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=42.42s)]
*  The Press Trust then shared images of medics rushing casualties on stretches. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=43.66s)]
*  The chairman of the group that operates Air India said in a statement that its flight, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=47.86s)]
*  which was bound for London's Gatwick Airport, was involved in a tragic incident. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=53.46s)]
*  The Associated Press reports that it's the first crash of this kind of aircraft, a Boeing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=58.3s)]
*  787 Dreamliner. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=62.86s)]
*  Reuters said the aircraft gave a Mayday call signalling an emergency before it crashed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=64.86s)]
*  The last accident involving Air India was in 2020 when more than 20 people were killed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=70.06s)]
*  Diya Hadid, NPR News, Mumbai. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=75.82s)]
*  It's been quiet overnight in Los Angeles where a second overnight curfew remains in place. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=78.16s)]
*  The curfew is limited to one square mile of downtown LA. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=82.98s)]
*  Thousands of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines have been ordered to LA. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=86.58s)]
*  Speaking to a Senate panel yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth refused to rule out [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=90.98s)]
*  the possibility that President Trump could order more U.S. military troops to even more [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=95.54s)]
*  cities. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=100.5s)]
*  Part of it is getting ahead of a problem so that if in other places, if there are other [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=101.5s)]
*  riots in places where law enforcement officers are threatened, we would have the capability [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=107.58000000000001s)]
*  to surge National Guard there if necessary. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=112.42s)]
*  And thankfully in most of those states, you'd have a governor that recognizes the need for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  it, supports it, and mobilizes it him or herself. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=119.06s)]
*  California authorities are suing Trump to stop the deployments. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=122.22s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass says the raids and the deployments make the situation worse. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=125.82s)]
*  When you raid home depots and workplaces, when you tear parents and children apart, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=131.46s)]
*  and when you run armored caravans through our streets, you're not trying to keep anyone [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=136.46s)]
*  safe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=141.22s)]
*  You're trying to cause fear and panic. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=143.14s)]
*  Protests have spread to other cities, including Las Vegas, San Antonio, and Spokane, Washington. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=144.78s)]

*  crowd dispersed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=163.22s)]

*  agreements. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=170.54s)]
*  NPR's Jana Raff reports Iran has responded. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  It says it will expand its nuclear program. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=174.14s)]
*  Shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency accused Iran of noncompliance Thursday, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=176.94s)]
*  Iranian state media said the country in response would build a new uranium enrichment site [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=183.82s)]
*  in a secure location. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=189.22s)]
*  It was the first time in almost 20 years the U.N. agency has accused Iran of breaching [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=191.64s)]
*  its nonproliferation obligations. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=196.38s)]
*  Iran had signed a deal with the U.S. and other major powers 10 years ago, limiting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=199.8s)]
*  its uranium enrichment program. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=204.18s)]
*  But President Trump later pulled out of the accord. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=206.36s)]
*  He said Wednesday that the U.S. would not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u-NU0PgAk&t=209.68s)]
