*  It's time to move beyond the petty partisan bickering and the finger pointing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=37.36s)]
*  It's time to focus on how to solve the problems. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=43.6s)]

*  Deirdre Walsh, NPR News. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=68.48s)]
*  House Republicans have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=70.28s)]
*  They succeeded on their second try by a single vote. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=74.94s)]
*  The first impeachment vote last week failed. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=77.92s)]

*  But House Speaker Mike Johnson is refusing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=98.16s)]
*  Some Republicans, aligned with former President Donald Trump, say they want to block it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  But House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffrey says that's not true of all Republicans. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=105.44s)]
*  He says if the foreign aid bill was on the House floor this moment, it would get a lot [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=110.62s)]
*  of Republican support. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=114.88s)]
*  There are more than 300 bipartisan votes in the House of Representatives to pass the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  national security bill today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=124.8s)]
*  But Democrats are in the minority in the House and forcing a bill to the floor for a vote [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=127.72s)]
*  over Republican objections is difficult. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=132.22s)]
*  Ukraine's military claims it has destroyed a large Russian landing ship in the Black [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=135.8s)]
*  Sea off the coast of occupied Crimea. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=139.76s)]
*  The Kremlin has not commented. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=142.68s)]
*  Russian President Piers Juenikakis reports from Kharkiv that Ukraine has regained control [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=144.72s)]
*  of parts of the Black Sea by targeting the Russian Navy and its infrastructure. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=148.72s)]
*  The Ukrainian military announced the hit on their official channel on Telegram, a social [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=153.56s)]
*  messaging site. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  The target was a large Russian landing ship called the Tsar Kunikov. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=159.6s)]
*  It can accommodate up to 87 crew members, but it's not clear how many were aboard. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=163.92s)]
*  Ukraine says it used maritime strike drones in the operation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=169.44s)]
*  Earlier in the day, Russia's Defense Ministry said it had destroyed six drones there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=172.92s)]
*  These naval drones have helped Ukraine drive Russian warships out of parts of the Black [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Sea. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=182.11999999999998s)]
*  That's helped open a shipping corridor for Ukraine's grain exports, which Ukrainian authorities [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  say are now at pre-war levels. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=187.72s)]
*  Juenikakis is reporting. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=189.64s)]

*  planes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=196.88s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports the investigators say the current standard is not long enough [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=197.88s)]
*  to preserve crucial evidence. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=202.72s)]
*  The National Transportation Safety Board wants all cockpit voice recorders to capture 25 [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=204.96s)]
*  hours of audio, up from the current standard of two hours. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=210.04s)]
*  The NTSB says that's not enough. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=213.4s)]
*  The agency cites at least 14 times when lost evidence has hindered its investigations, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=215.32s)]
*  including the incident last month when a door plug panel blew out of an Alaska Airlines [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=220.4s)]
*  jet in midair. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=224.44s)]
*  Cockpit voice recorders are designed to capture conversations between pilots and any other [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=226.48s)]
*  noises that might help investigators. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=230.44s)]
*  A proposal from the Federal Aviation Administration would require the 25-hour standard, but only [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  for newer planes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=237.78s)]
*  The NTSB is pushing to retrofit all aircraft with better voice recorders. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phuSPjt3BxM&t=239.35999999999999s)]
