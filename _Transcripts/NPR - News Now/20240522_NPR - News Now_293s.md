**NPR - News Now:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8)
*  Spain, Norway, and Ireland have announced that they will recognize Palestinian statehood. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=0.0s)]
*  And actress Scarlett Johansson and other artists are calling for federal legislation to regulate [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=6.8s)]
*  artificial intelligence. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=12.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=14.08s)]

*  with other European nations expected to follow suit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=26.72s)]
*  Terri Schulz reports Israel is strongly opposing the move, arguing that recognizing a Palestinian [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=30.16s)]

*  Ireland, Spain, and Norway made coordinated announcements saying they recognize an independent [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=43.760000000000005s)]

*  toward a two-state solution. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=64.56s)]
*  It is an expression of our view that Palestine holds and should be able to vindicate the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=66.56s)]
*  full rights of a state, including self-determination, self-governance, territorial integrity, and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  security. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=75.68s)]

*  proceedings. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=156.62s)]
*  Today, Judge Cannon is hearing two of nearly a dozen motions to dismiss the case filed [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=157.62s)]
*  by Trump and his co-defendants. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0QSXVd3JS8&t=161.64s)]
