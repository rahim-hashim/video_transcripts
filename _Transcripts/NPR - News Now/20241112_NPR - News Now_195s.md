*  It would take land claimed by Palestinians and essentially destroy the possibility of a two-state solution, something the U.S. has long called for. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNbG-IIZmlc&t=120.0s)]

*  For people who have missed this run-up, there's lots of things that you wish you had bought a week ago, but I think it's already too late. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNbG-IIZmlc&t=165.0s)]
