# U.N. Court Orders Israel To Do More To Protect Palestinians' Lives | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, January 26th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  The U.N.'s highest court, the International Court of Justice, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=6.88s)]
*  is issuing its first major decision in a case alleging that Israel is committing genocide [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=9.76s)]
*  against Palestinians in Gaza. This stems from the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=14.48s)]
*  The court won't rule on the genocide issue immediately, but in the interim, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=19.36s)]
*  ICJ President Joan Donahue says the court is ruling Israel must take immediate measures to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=23.44s)]
*  protect Palestinians' lives. Israel must take measures within its power to prevent and punish [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=29.12s)]
*  the direct and public incitement to commit genocide in relation to the members of the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=36.72s)]
*  Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip. The court says Israel must also reply within one month [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=41.52s)]
*  about steps that it is taking to protect Palestinian civilians. Israel has rejected the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=46.96s)]
*  allegation of genocide, saying it is taking all measures to protect civilians. The war started [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=52.56s)]
*  last October when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mainly civilians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=58.24s)]
*  A bipartisan border deal being worked out among senators could be in jeopardy. The issue is vital [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=65.28s)]
*  because Republican lawmakers say they won't pass aid for Israel or Ukraine without addressing U.S. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=70.88s)]
*  border security first. NPR's Eric McDaniel reports. Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=76.56s)]
*  wants a deal. Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants one too. But GOP presidential [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  frontrunner Donald Trump? He doesn't, and a lot of members are loathe to cross him. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=87.12s)]
*  That means that after months of negotiations dragged on into a presidential year, the political [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  shot clock may have expired. But the negotiators say they're pressing ahead, dotting i's and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  crossing t's, before formally unveiling the legislation as soon as next week. It's expected [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=101.76s)]
*  to majorly overhaul how migrants are processed at the U.S. southern border and send military aid to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine and Israel. Once it's out, Republicans will weigh a potential policy win against upsetting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=111.84s)]
*  Donald Trump. Eric McDaniel, NPR News, Washington. Alabama has executed convicted murderer Kenneth [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=117.76s)]
*  Smith by nitrogen gas. Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassett reports this is the first U.S. execution [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=124.48s)]
*  to use this method. Kenneth Smith and an accomplice were convicted and sentenced to death for the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=131.68s)]
*  1988 murder for hire of Elizabeth's Senate. Alabama attempted but failed to execute Smith [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=138.08s)]
*  by lethal injection in 2022. State officials decided they would place a mask over Smith's face [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=144.0s)]
*  and pump in nitrogen gas, causing him to die from deprivation of oxygen. Once Alabama created [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  protocols for this new method last year, Smith and his lawyers objected, calling it experimental [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=156.96s)]
*  and inhumane. In a statement following the execution, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=163.04s)]
*  Smith had answered for his horrendous crimes and got what he asked for. For NPR News, I'm Kyle [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=169.28s)]
*  Gassett in Montgomery, Alabama. This is NPR. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCXWHjBmvI&t=175.51999999999998s)]
