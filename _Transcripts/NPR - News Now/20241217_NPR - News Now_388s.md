**NPR - News Now:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io)
*  A 15-year-old girl shot and killed a teacher and a fellow student yesterday at a Christian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=0.0s)]
*  school in Madison, Wisconsin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=4.7s)]
*  And an explosion in Moscow has killed a Russian lieutenant general. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=6.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=10.84s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=11.84s)]
*  Police in Madison, Wisconsin say a 15-year-old student shot and killed a teacher and another [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=15.34s)]
*  student and injured several others yesterday at a Christian school. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=20.1s)]
*  And Biersmaeg Anderson reports Madison Police Chief Sean Barnes says the shooter then took [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=24.48s)]
*  her own life. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=29.88s)]
*  At a press conference Monday, Chief Barnes said the police department is still working [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=31.08s)]
*  to determine a motive in the shooting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=34.96s)]
*  He said the shooting happened in a study hall, and a 911 call from the school came in shortly [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=37.36s)]
*  before 11 a.m. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=42.14s)]
*  That call was made by a second grader. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=44.24s)]
*  As parents waited at a reunification center to hear about their children's safety, pastors [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=47.34s)]
*  from other churches came to offer them comfort. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=52.56s)]
*  Adam Penning was one of them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  What I saw today were parents who have this instinct, which is when their kid falls and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=57.54s)]
*  skins their knee, they've always been able to jump in to help. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=62.3s)]
*  But he said this time all they could do was wait, sometimes for hours, to find out if [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=66.06s)]
*  their kid was OK. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=71.58s)]

*  six weeks. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=130.32s)]

*  the age of 50, and hostages with medical conditions. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=139.9s)]
*  The official says Israeli troops would partially withdraw from areas of Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=143.6s)]
*  Israel would boost humanitarian aid and both sides would continue talks to free the remaining [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW3quMw4io&t=148.12s)]
