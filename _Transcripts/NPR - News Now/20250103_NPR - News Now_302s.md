*  premeditated and evil act. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, New Orleans. The new [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mm2RpxnkA4&t=69.28s)]
*  Congress convenes later today. The first task of the House of Representatives is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mm2RpxnkA4&t=75.28s)]
*  to vote for a speaker. Current speaker Mike Johnson is running for the job [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mm2RpxnkA4&t=80.12s)]
