# Oprah's Endorsement Is A Major Win For The Harris Campaign | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus)
*  Oprah Winfrey endorsed Kamala Harris and a surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night also included a speech from the mother and father of an Israeli hostage held by Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=5.9s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=11.9s)]
*  Tim Walz has accepted the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=16.6s)]
*  He closed out a lengthy roster of speakers last night, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=22.1s)]
*  declaring the Democratic Party is one that works toward inclusion. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=25.1s)]
*  Media mogul Oprah Winfrey also took the stage last night in Chicago. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=28.8s)]
*  She delivered a rousing endorsement for Vice President Harris. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  As NPR's Jung Yoon Han reports, the surprise appearance is a win for the Harris campaign. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=36.0s)]
*  Winfrey has selectively used her far-reaching influence to support political candidates in the past, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=41.5s)]
*  and she chose to throw her weight behind Harris on Wednesday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=47.2s)]
*  Common sense tells you that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=50.9s)]
*  Winfrey's influence over shaping public opinion is commonly known as the quote, Oprah effect. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=58.9s)]
*  Winfrey has supported other Democrats in recent years, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=64.0s)]
*  but this was her first time speaking at a political convention and delivering an endorsement at the same time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=66.9s)]
*  Jung Yoon Han, NPR News, Chicago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=72.9s)]
*  Another convention speaker was John Pollan. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=75.3s)]
*  His son, Hirsch Goldberg Pollan, was kidnapped by Hamas militants from Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=78.19999999999999s)]
*  Pollan is calling for a ceasefire deal in Gaza and for the hostages' release. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  This is a political convention. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=87.8s)]
*  But needing our only son and all of the cherished hostages' home is not a political issue. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=92.6s)]
*  It is a humanitarian issue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=101.2s)]
*  The White House says President Biden spoke with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=111.9s)]
*  They were joined by Vice President Harris. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=116.7s)]
*  They discussed stalled peace talks between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  Ceasefire talks are supposed to resume as early as today in Cairo. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=123.0s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has visited a border region in northern Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  This is near the spot where Ukrainian troops recently invaded Russia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=133.0s)]
*  As NPR's Greg Myhre reports from Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have now been operating inside Russia for more than two weeks. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=137.4s)]
*  Zelensky made the unannounced visit to the Sumi border region and received a briefing from his top military commander. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=145.3s)]
*  The president said Ukrainian forces had taken control of another Russian village and captured more prisoners. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=151.5s)]
*  Ukraine is also sending humanitarian supplies to assist civilians across the border in Russia's Kursk region. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=157.6s)]
*  The Ukrainian military entered Russian territory on August 6th and says it now holds about 500 square miles. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=164.5s)]
*  In a separate development, Russian officials said a Ukrainian drone attack ignited a large fire at a military base in southern Russia. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=172.0s)]
*  Ukraine is carrying out such attacks with increasing frequency. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=179.8s)]
*  Greg Myhre, NPR News, Kyiv. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=183.7s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSgwXx-Drus&t=186.8s)]
