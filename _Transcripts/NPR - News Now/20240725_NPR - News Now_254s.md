# Biden Talks Passing The Torch In Oval Office Address | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0)
*  President Biden talked about passing the torch to a younger generation in a speech last night [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=0.0s)]
*  from the Oval Office. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=5.12s)]
*  And the bodies of five Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza were recovered yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=6.62s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=12.34s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=13.34s)]
*  President Biden says he ended his re-election campaign over concerns about the future of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=17.26s)]
*  democracy in the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=21.18s)]
*  In last night's Oval Office address, Biden said the best way to unite the nation was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=23.06s)]
*  to pass the torch to a new generation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=27.0s)]
*  NPR's Lexi Schepittle reports the president spoke for about 10 minutes as he reaffirmed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=29.54s)]
*  his support of Vice President Harris to become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=34.1s)]
*  President Biden said he believes stepping aside was the best way to unite the country [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=39.62s)]
*  ahead of November's election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=43.06s)]
*  I revere this office, but I love my country more. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=44.46s)]
*  It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=51.739999999999995s)]
*  Biden said he will devote the remaining months of his term to advancing his key policy priorities, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=58.339999999999996s)]

*  in the Middle East. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=67.02s)]
*  Lexi Schepittle, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump turned his ire to Vice President Harris yesterday in Charlotte, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=70.5s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=75.7s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordoñez reports on Trump's first rally since President Biden dropped his campaign [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=76.7s)]
*  for re-election. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=82.38s)]
*  The former president repeatedly mispronounced Vice President Kamala Harris's name while [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=83.58s)]
*  describing her as more radical than Biden and a danger to democracy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=87.98s)]
*  They say something happened to me when I got shot. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=92.54s)]
*  I became nice. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=95.78s)]
*  And when you're dealing with these people, they're very dangerous people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=98.18s)]
*  When you're dealing with them, you can't be too nice. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  You really can't be. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  So if you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  Is that OK? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=107.22s)]
*  Trump was accompanied by his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=108.22s)]
*  It's only the second rally where they appeared together in a week since the assassination [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=111.7s)]
*  attempt against the former president. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=115.92s)]
*  The visit reflects the importance Trump is putting on North Carolina, which he won twice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=118.48s)]
*  But the margin was so small in 2020 that Democrats see an opportunity to flip the state. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ4yz53Kf-0&t=123.62s)]
