*  and we are evaluating it right now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=33.32s)]
*  He declined to offer further comment. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=35.16s)]

*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is going to Qatar today for talks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=46.32s)]
*  He has said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports the plan, but that appears [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=50.480000000000004s)]

*  A Delaware jury convicted President Biden's son Hunter yesterday of three criminal charges. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=58.96s)]

*  That's what won in the end. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=92.8s)]
*  It won in the courtroom in Delaware a year ago, and it is the reason that they had to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=93.8s)]
*  ultimately bring this to trial. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5BV3GMryjI&t=97.84s)]
