**NPR - News Now:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk)
*  The federal government could be on the verge of partially shutting down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=0.0s)]
*  And less than a week before Christmas in Hanukkah, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=3.84s)]
*  workers at Amazon facilities across the country are going on strike. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=6.4s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=10.48s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  The federal government may partially shut down late tomorrow night. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=15.08s)]
*  That's because a bipartisan funding bill has been thrown out at the very last minute. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=18.48s)]
*  Yesterday, President-elect Trump threatened every Republican lawmaker [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=22.96s)]
*  who supported it with a primary challenge. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=26.68s)]
*  House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries is furious. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=29.16s)]
*  House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=32.56s)]
*  and hurt everyday Americans all across this country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Republicans were also hammered online by Trump ally and billionaire Elon Musk. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=46.72s)]
*  They say the bill's laden with too much money for Democratic interests. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=51.36s)]
*  But the spending bill's failure means there is no additional money [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  to help cope with natural disasters such as hurricanes [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=58.2s)]
*  or desperately needed aid for American farmers. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=61.52s)]
*  The Teamsters Union says it's launching strikes this morning [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=64.88s)]
*  at Amazon facilities across the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=67.88s)]
*  The union claims the retailer has failed to bargain over a new contract. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=70.4s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Hsu reports the strikes come less than a week before Christmas and Hanukkah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=74.6s)]
*  The Teamsters say a mix of workers, including pickers and packers [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=79.84s)]
*  and third-party delivery drivers will be picketing seven Amazon facilities [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  in and around Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago and New York City. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=88.92s)]
*  Additionally, more pickets could format other Amazon facilities [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=93.48s)]
*  where workers have not yet authorized strikes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  Patricia Campos-Medina, executive director of the Worker Institute at Cornell, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=100.12s)]
*  says any disruption at this time of year could be damaging to the company. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=104.4s)]
*  It is the holiday season. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  People are expecting deliveries. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=110.48s)]
*  This is the moment that the workers have influence over the supply chain. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=112.96s)]
*  For its part, Amazon disputes the Teamsters' claim that it represents thousands of their workers. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Andrea Hsu and PR News. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=124.16s)]
*  will appear in a courtroom in central Pennsylvania today. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  New York prosecutors want to extradite Luigi Mangione to face murder charges, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=131.4s)]
*  but he also faces weapons charges in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  In Syria, the first domestic flight since the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=140.12s)]
*  departed Damascus yesterday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Hadil Al-Shalchi reports it's just one way the new leadership is trying to prove [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  it can get Syria back up and running. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=152.72000000000003s)]
*  The commercial Syrian air flight landed in Aleppo airport an hour behind schedule, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  but Enes Rustom, the man appointed to oversee the airport, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=160.24s)]
*  said that it was, quote, a big accomplishment towards rebuilding the country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  There was no word of when international flights would resume, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=167.4s)]
*  but Rustom said Syria welcomed flights from all countries to start coming back. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=170.4s)]
*  ATM's and electronic payment services are also now back online in Syria. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  The group currently in charge of running Syria is Hey Et Tahrir Sham, or HTS, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=179.72000000000003s)]
*  and faces a massive challenge. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=184.28000000000003s)]
*  It needs to reunite a very diverse Syria and bring back state institutions [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=186.16000000000003s)]
*  that have been crippled by years of sanctions and corruption. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shalchi, NPR News, Damascus. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=193.88000000000002s)]

*  The group studied satellite imagery as well as videos of Israeli soldiers demolishing a key water reservoir, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=229.23999999999998s)]

*  What we have found is that the Israeli government is intentionally killing Palestinians in Gaza [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  by denying them the water that they need to survive. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=244.88s)]

*  We did find that moderate drinking is related to a lower risk of heart disease death. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=313.68s)]
*  But they found moderate consumption was linked to a higher risk of breast cancer. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=319.76s)]
*  Researchers say the evidence is far from perfect. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZITgvj4qJk&t=324.28s)]
