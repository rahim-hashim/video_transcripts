*  Details are emerging about the three U.S. soldiers killed in a drone strike in Jordan last weekend. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=68.7s)]

*  She actually graduated with my youngest daughter. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  Moy says he quickly penned a proclamation to lower flags to half staff. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=107.1s)]
*  It was a way for us recognizing our own from her home county. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=110.8s)]
*  Moy says the flags will remain lowered, in the words of the proclamation, until the sun sets on the day of her interment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=115.2s)]

*  Nobody deserves it more than this man. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=144.8s)]
*  I call him the architect of destruction and chaos. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=147.8s)]
*  He has created this crisis, and he knows better. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=151.8s)]
*  He's smarter. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=155.0s)]
*  But Democratic lawmakers say this is a political ploy by Republicans. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=156.0s)]
*  Mississippi's Benny Thompson says the GOP wants an election year showdown over immigration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=160.8s)]
*  This is a singularly focused effort led by Republicans who are just trying to drum up this notion that somehow [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=166.3s)]
*  this is an issue that the Republicans can ride into November. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=177.3s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas did not testify in his own defense, but released a letter denying the allegations. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=183.3s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxK-d1lAs8E&t=189.3s)]
