# Hundreds Hold Vigil For Central Texas' Flash Flooding Victims | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg)
*  Hundreds of people gathered in Central Texas last night at a vigil for victims of the catastrophic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=0.0s)]
*  flooding last week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=5.64s)]
*  And Elon Musk's new America Party is expected to attract young men. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=7.2s)]
*  That's a group that was key to President Trump's win. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=12.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=15.94s)]
*  I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=16.94s)]
*  A new analysis from NPR and data scientists find at least 17 buildings and cabins at campsites [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  in Central Texas were at greater risk than the government previously reported. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=27.16s)]
*  And here's Laura Sullivan has more. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  An analysis by climate modeling company First Street found FEMA failed to properly account [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=34.22s)]
*  for the threat from rainfall when developing its maps. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=39.28s)]
*  It wasn't just a problem at the camp. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=42.88s)]
*  FEMA's maps undercount the number of homes in danger throughout the country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=44.92s)]
*  Data scientists say FEMA relies on tidal surge and river data, and the agency lacks funding [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=48.78s)]
*  and a mandate to update its process. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=53.56s)]
*  NPR found special interest groups like homebuilders associations often lobbied to prevent the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  agency from getting that funding. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=61.36s)]
*  At Camp Mystic, NPR also found at least eight buildings, including cabins for younger campers, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  located inside the floodway, a dangerous area expected to see high-velocity water. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=69.68s)]
*  Laura Sullivan, NPR News. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=75.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered at a vigil last night for the victims and the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=77.8s)]
*  missing. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=81.8s)]
*  In Texas newsrooms, Lucio Vasquez is in the Texas Hill Country, where at least 120 people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=82.8s)]
*  died, more than 160 are missing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=87.84s)]
*  Bleachers filled with grieving neighbors, all praying and singing together, remembering [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=90.8s)]
*  the victims. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=95.52s)]
*  The vigil also included a tribute to Camp Mystic, which became the heart of one of the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=98.92s)]
*  deadliest natural disasters in Texas history. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=103.32s)]
*  Randy Rose, who grew up in the area, says the vigil gave the community a moment to breathe. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=106.8s)]
*  It was a time of healing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=112.24s)]
*  It was a time of trying to, you know, get back to some normalcy and step away from the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=113.24s)]
*  tragedy for a minute. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  Rose says he felt lighter after leaving the vigil. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=118.52s)]
*  Still, the community is bracing for long days ahead. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=121.52s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Lucio Vasquez in Kerrville. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  Russia bombarded Ukraine again last night in an hours-long assault that left at least [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=129.56s)]
*  two people dead. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=134.28s)]
*  This as President Trump made an abrupt turnaround on weapons to Ukraine, saying the U.S. will [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=135.76s)]
*  send additional weapons after a pause by the Pentagon. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=140.68s)]
*  But it's unclear what will be sent and what might still be on hold. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=144.0s)]
*  And Pierce Tom Bowman has more. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=148.4s)]
*  All we know is that Trump has overruled Pentagon leaders who announced that halt. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  And he said, quote, We're going to send more weapons. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=153.84s)]
*  We have to. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  They have to be able to defend themselves. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  He said this as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was sitting next to him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=160.10000000000002s)]
*  Now he wasn't specific, and the Pentagon would only say in a statement it was sending additional [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=163.88s)]
*  weapons. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=169.76s)]
*  And that was all. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=170.76s)]
*  Now we expect they'll send more Patriot missiles. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=171.76s)]
*  There are some 30 being held in Poland, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=174.16s)]
*  to speak. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=179.76s)]
*  And these missiles, of course, have been key in destroying incoming Russian missiles. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=180.76s)]
*  NPR's Tom Bowman reporting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=185.0s)]
*  With his eyes on the midterm elections, Elon Musk says he's starting a new political party. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=187.86s)]
*  He's calling it the American Party and says voters want a middle ground option. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=192.6s)]
*  As NPR's Elena Moore reports, it's something that could appeal to a key group Trump made [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=197.64s)]
*  gains with last fall, young men. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=202.48s)]
*  Third parties often take away votes from major parties in close races. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  That could be a problem in the midterms. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  Plus, men under 30 are a valuable group for Republicans to hold on to. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=212.16s)]
*  They were key to Trump's win last fall. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=216.44s)]
*  But they're not reliable Republican voters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  Polling shows that young men are uniquely critical of both political parties. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=221.72s)]
*  We still don't have a great idea of where young men are going to go. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=225.4s)]
*  Where are Gen Z men going to be in 20 years when it comes to their politics? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=230.16s)]
*  That's Dan Cox with the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=234.16s)]
*  Though he's unsure if Musk's party can attract these voters, he says there's a huge opportunity [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=238.12s)]
*  to engage with them. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=243.34s)]
*  Elena Moore, NPR News. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=244.8s)]
*  President Trump announced a 50 percent tariff on imports from Brazil. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=246.96s)]
*  But as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports, the new threat is different from the other [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=251.56s)]
*  ones he made this week. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=255.68s)]
*  Trump announced the tariff rate by posting a letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=257.36s)]
*  Lula da Silva on social media Wednesday, his 22nd letter this week. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=261.0s)]
*  All of the other letters were similar, telling countries that the new tariffs were being [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=265.96s)]
*  imposed to rectify their trade imbalances with the U.S. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=269.24s)]
*  But the letter to Brazil was about politics. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=272.64s)]
*  Trump angrily referenced what he calls a witch hunt against former far-right president Jair [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=275.56s)]
*  Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for an alleged attempted coup against Lula. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=279.48s)]
*  Trump has long praised the far-right Bolsonaro, who lost in a 2022 reelection bid against [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=284.48s)]
*  Lula. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=289.0s)]
*  Shortly thereafter, Bolsonaro's supporters stormed the capital, Brasilia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=290.0s)]
*  Danielle Kurtzleben and NPR News. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=293.76s)]
*  In Los Angeles, more than 31 workers building an underground tunnel for a wastewater treatment [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=295.76s)]
*  plant have been rescued after a partial collapse. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  Steve Futterman has more. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=304.76s)]
*  The collapse occurred in the early evening. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=306.36s)]
*  People say the trapped workers had to climb through debris up to 15 feet high. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=309.12s)]
*  The massive seven-mile underground tunnel is designed to return wastewater that's been [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=313.36s)]
*  treated back into the ocean. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=317.48s)]
*  When the collapse occurred, more than 100 first responders raced to the scene. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  A triage unit was set up. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  Fortunately, it was not needed. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=326.0s)]
*  L.A. Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  I was so concerned that we were going to find tragedy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=329.68s)]
*  Instead, what we found was victory. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=333.32s)]
*  All of the men that were in that tunnel rescued. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=336.88s)]
*  The rescue workers inside a giant cage were lifted out of the tunnel by a crane. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=340.35999999999996s)]
*  There will be an investigation to determine what caused the collapse. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=345.28s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=349.23999999999995s)]
*  Silicon Valley chipmaker NVIDIA is now the first publicly traded company to surpass a [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=353.23999999999995s)]
*  $4 trillion market valuation. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  That from the investor frenzy over artificial intelligence, powered by its industry-leading [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=362.32s)]
*  processors. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=366.82s)]
*  The milestone reflects the upheaval being unleashed by AI, which is widely viewed as [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=368.4s)]
*  the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=373.04s)]
*  Underscoring that, NVIDIA is now worth $900 billion more than Apple. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=379.86s)]
*  In Thailand, thousands of people from around the world are flocking to the Kaokyo Open [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=385.3s)]
*  Zoo to celebrate the first birthday of Mu Dang. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=390.94s)]
*  She's a baby pygmy hippo that's become a social media sensation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  To celebrate her day, she took a few naps, ate a watermelon and vegetables before she [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=400.06s)]
*  was hosed down for a shower. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=404.65999999999997s)]
*  She also got a 44-pound hippo-sized cake. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=407.14s)]
*  Baby pygmies are native to West Africa and they are endangered. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=410.91999999999996s)]

*  For seven weeks, the top of the Billboard albums chart has been reserved for Morgan [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=427.46s)]
*  Wallen's I'm the Problem. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  It's a blockbuster whose streaming numbers have remained remarkably consistent. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=434.21999999999997s)]
*  But the rest of the top ten has been volatile in recent weeks, as new albums storm the chart [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=438.68s)]
*  only to quickly drop out. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=443.65999999999997s)]
*  But there's an exception, the soundtrack to the Netflix original movie K-Pop Demon [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=445.6s)]
*  Hunters. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=450.70000000000005s)]
*  That's golden by several contributors to the movie and its soundtrack. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcucegIljlg&t=454.70000000000005s)]
