# 1 Child Dead, More Than 20 Hospitalized In Texas Measles Outbreak | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg)
*  The Trump administration is terminating thousands of foreign aid grants and awards, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=0.0s)]
*  effectively gutting the U.S. agency for international development. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And legendary actor Gene Hackman has died at the age of 95. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=15.08s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=17.92s)]
*  The White House will continue to withhold funding from the U.S. agency for international development. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=20.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court on Wednesday paused a lower court ruling that required the Trump administration [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=27.0s)]
*  to pay nearly two billion dollars in foreign assistance to USAID. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=32.28s)]
*  NPR's Fatma Tanis reports the agency has been effectively gutted. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=37.56s)]
*  Those grants funded all kinds of humanitarian and development projects aimed at disease control, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=42.92s)]
*  migration prevention, hunger prevention, supporting human rights. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  And the same process has happened over at the State Department where most foreign assistance grants [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=52.08s)]
*  around $4,100 have been cut. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=56.72s)]
*  The State Department says they've saved about $60 billion, which is around 1% of the overall federal budget. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=59.36s)]
*  That's NPR's Fatma Tanis reporting. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=65.88s)]
*  President Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=68.8s)]
*  was on Capitol Hill Wednesday for her confirmation hearing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=72.88s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports she's a California attorney who's been an outspoken supporter of President Trump [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=76.52s)]
*  and a champion of conservative causes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=83.76s)]
*  The Republican majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee appears to be united in support of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=86.64s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon's nomination. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=90.92s)]
*  At her confirmation hearing, Dhillon said that fighting anti-Semitism on college campuses [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=92.68s)]
*  would be a priority for her, as would tackling DEI efforts that she said have been used to apply racial quotas [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=97.12s)]
*  to deny people equal access to education and employment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=103.64s)]
*  So we'll certainly be taking a close look at all of those and enforcing the law equally in favor of all Americans. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=107.12s)]
*  Democrats and civil rights groups oppose her nomination. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  They say that in her previous work, Dhillon has tried to restrict voting rights, transgender rights, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=116.0s)]
*  and has opposed reproductive rights. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=121.28s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=123.56s)]
*  A federal judge in San Francisco will hear arguments today over whether the Trump administration's firing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  of thousands of probationary employees should be halted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=131.96s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Shue reports it's one of the many legal challenges the administration is facing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=136.4s)]
*  as it moves ahead with plans to downsize the federal workforce. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=142.2s)]
*  These were employees who were still on probationary status, meaning usually their first or second year in that job. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=145.96s)]
*  And a lot of them were told that they were being fired for performance reasons, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=151.96s)]
*  even though many of them had gotten positive performance reviews and some weren't even on the job long enough to get a review. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=155.56s)]
*  So the labor unions are arguing that the agencies themselves had no plans to fire these employees [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=161.64s)]
*  and only did so at the direction of the administration and specifically the Office of Personnel Management. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=167.6s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Shue reporting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=173.04s)]
*  President Trump will host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House today. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=175.48s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordonez reports the two leaders are expected to address a number of issues, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=181.16s)]
*  including the war in Ukraine, defense spending, and tariffs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=187.2s)]
*  The UK Prime Minister visits Washington days after the French President Emmanuel Macron [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  spent the afternoon at the White House urging Trump to maintain US support for Ukraine. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=196.84s)]
*  Keir Starmer will be echoing those calls and he hopes to woo Trump with his recent announcement [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=202.32s)]
*  of an increase in defense spending as a commitment to boost Europe's security. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=207.68s)]
*  Starmer says Britain will increase its defense spending to 2.5% of economic output by 2027. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump has spent much of his first few weeks back in power criticizing US allies for not spending enough on defense, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=220.28s)]
*  while his own administration builds stronger ties with Russia. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  Starmer is also expected to seek exemptions from Trump's proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=231.4s)]
*  Franco Ordonez, NPR News. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=238.0s)]
*  Health officials in Texas say more than 20 people are hospitalized amid an outbreak of measles that has left one child dead. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Lara Johnson, the chief medical officer at Covenant Health in Lubbock says the risk is low for people who have been vaccinated. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=249.12s)]
*  For those of us who are fully vaccinated against measles, the risk, a lot of people are worried about what's your risk in the community. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=257.68s)]
*  Your risk is extremely, extremely low of having any issues at all with measles. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  The risk with measles is really for those who are not immune, who have not been vaccinated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=270.32s)]
*  The CDC says 124 confirmed cases of the measles, mostly among teens and children, have been confirmed in the US so far this year. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=276.12s)]
*  The government predicts the cost of eggs will rise more than 40% this year. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=285.64s)]
*  Egg prices are higher in the US because of a shortage triggered by an outbreak of bird flu. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=290.84s)]
*  Legendary actor Gene Hackman and his wife had been found dead at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=297.24s)]

*  That's where they found the bodies of 95-year-old Gene Hackman and his 63-year-old wife Betsy Arakawa, a retired classical pianist. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=316.91999999999996s)]

*  Hackman had been living in New Mexico for years after a long career in TV and films, including the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=335.0s)]
*  He won two Academy Awards for the French Connection and Unforgiven, and Hackman was memorable in a range of movies, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPZ9uK7sg&t=343.28000000000003s)]
