# Trump Unveils Plans For 'Golden Dome' Missile Defense System | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo)
*  President Trump is warning House Republicans, quote, they wouldn't be a Republican much longer if they do not support a budget bill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  And due to cuts, some National Weather Service offices have had to suspend staffing their overnight shifts. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=7.28s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=13.68s)]
*  House Republican leaders are still working to finalize their massive tax and border protection bill. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=18.48s)]
*  That's a day after President Trump visited Capitol Hill to rally support for it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=24.32s)]
*  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports GOP holdouts say they won't vote for the bill without changes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=28.72s)]
*  President Trump stressed that his party was unified and warned those who didn't back the package risked a major tax increase. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=34.08s)]
*  I mean, what Republican could vote for that to happen because they wouldn't be a Republican much longer. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=42.0s)]
*  They would get they would be knocked out so fast. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=46.64s)]
*  But House Speaker Mike Johnson is still balancing a push for moderates to increase a tax break for constituents who live in districts with high state and local taxes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  With demands from conservatives to slash federal spending. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=58.72s)]
*  He can only afford to lose three votes and get it through the chamber. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  The committee that sets rules for floor debate is still meeting and there are no details on a deal yet. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=66.08s)]
*  Even if the House passes the bill this week, Senate GOP leaders say they expect to make changes to it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=71.92s)]
*  Deirdre Walsh, NPR News, The Capitol. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=78.08s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has come under criticism during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing yesterday. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  She was there to discuss her agency's budget, but Noem blundered in one answer. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=87.6s)]
*  New Hampshire Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan asked Noem to define habeas corpus, a key constitutional right. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=92.64s)]
*  Noem incorrectly replied. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=100.24s)]
*  Habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their right to. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=102.64s)]
*  Let me stop you ma'am. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=110.56s)]
*  Habeas corpus, excuse me, that's that's incorrect. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  President Blinken used it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=114.56s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=116.8s)]
*  Habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=118.0s)]
*  If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  Noem then said she supported habeas corpus, but insisted the president can suspend it whenever he wants. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Senator Hassan said not without approval from Congress. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=140.8s)]
*  A federal judge held a hearing late yesterday on a case involving the federal government's deportation of migrants. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=144.8s)]
*  This time, the case involves migrants from one country who came to the U.S. illegally but are deported to a third country that's not their own. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=150.96s)]
*  And Piers Jimenez-Bustillo explains. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=158.72s)]
*  Massachusetts federal judge Brian Murphy held an emergency hearing on Tuesday night over these third country deportations, this time to South Sudan. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=160.96s)]
*  Immigration lawyers say at least one Vietnamese man was sent to South Sudan in Africa despite political instability there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=169.84s)]
*  Murphy said if that were true, then this would violate his April order, which barred deportations to these countries where migrants aren't originally from, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=176.88s)]
*  unless people get sufficient time to contest their deportations and a notice in their native language. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=184.88s)]
*  The federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to keep in its custody any migrants deported to South Sudan [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=190.48s)]
*  until he ensures they receive sufficient due process before their removals. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Jimenez-Bustillo, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Israel continues to hit Gaza with deadly airstrikes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=204.56s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 85 Palestinians have been killed overnight. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=207.52s)]
*  Israel says it has allowed aid to enter the Palestinian enclave. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=212.8s)]
*  But NPR's Hadil Al-Shilchi reports the United Nations says none of that aid has reached any of the Palestinians in need. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=216.8s)]
*  After much international pressure, Israel said it allowed a quote minimal amount of aid into Gaza [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=223.92s)]
*  after a nearly three-month blockade on all food, medicine and fuel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  The United Nations said the aid has entered Gaza but that workers weren't able to bring it to distribution warehouses. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  It said the Israeli military forced them to reload the aid into separate trucks and they ran out of time. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=240.48s)]
*  And they say the amount of aid getting in is wholly inadequate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  Aid organizations say that two million Palestinians in Gaza are at a high risk of famine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=249.84s)]
*  Ceasefire talks are at an impasse. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=255.04s)]
*  Hamas wants a complete end to the war. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=257.12s)]
*  Israel will only commit to a temporary ceasefire. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=259.28s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shilchi, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=262.24s)]
*  President Trump says the U.S. is going to start work on a new missile defense shield. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=265.12s)]
*  He's calling it the Golden Dome. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=269.36s)]
*  Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=271.36s)]
*  even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=276.32s)]
*  Trump claims the project will cost around $175 billion and can be finished in three years. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Experts say that's unlikely. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  They doubt it will be limited to that price. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=290.08s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office estimates a missile shield program for the U.S. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  could cost at a minimum half a trillion dollars. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=296.56s)]
*  Some offices of the National Weather Service are cutting back their 24-hour shifts. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=300.0s)]
*  That's because of understaffing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=304.4s)]
*  The Mountain West News Bureau's Hannah Merzbach reports. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=306.23999999999995s)]
*  Offices in Alaska, California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, and Wyoming [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  are shutting down from 11 at night to 6 in the morning. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  That's because staff is down by up to 60 percent in those offices due to federal cuts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  The Weather Service Union's Tom Fahey says nearby offices could help pick up the slack. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=323.44s)]
*  The Weather Service at this particular time is simply doing triage. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  It's like battlefield medicine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=332.56s)]
*  You have a pop-up hospital that comes in, takes care of people. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Fahey says the Trump administration has approved 155 temporary employees, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=337.44s)]
*  but the Weather Service has lost about 600 workers in recent months. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=343.04s)]
*  The agency said it continues to meet its core mission. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Hannah Merzbach in Jackson, Wyoming. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=351.6s)]
*  The maker of the popular video game Fortnite is celebrating. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=355.44s)]
*  After nearly five-year ban, Fortnite is now available again in Apple's App Store. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=358.96s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder reports. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=363.76s)]
*  The return to the Apple App Store is a big win for Epic Games, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  a video game company behind Fortnite, which posted on social media that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=369.76s)]
*  Fortnite is back and linking to the games page in the App Store for iPhones and iPads. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  Epic Games launched Fortnite in 2017. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=380.08s)]
*  It quickly became wildly popular but was removed from the App Store by Apple [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=383.12s)]
*  some three years later. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=387.92s)]
*  The two have been locked in a legal battle ever since over the commission [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  Apple charged for in-app purchases. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=392.8s)]
*  Although Epic lost a claim that Apple was operating an illegal monopoly, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  a federal judge late last month found Apple in violation of a court order [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=399.12s)]
*  to ease control over in-app payments and allow for links to other payment options. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=403.76s)]
*  Giles Snyder, NPR News. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=408.88s)]
*  The iconic Indianapolis 500 auto race is this weekend, but this Friday, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=410.88s)]
*  the Speedway says it's hosting the Weenie 500. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=415.52s)]
*  Six of the famous Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles will race each other. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=419.12s)]
*  Each Wienermobile will represent a different region of the U.S. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=423.12s)]
*  and it will be styled on their local style of hot dog. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDjvcol7Zo&t=426.71999999999997s)]
