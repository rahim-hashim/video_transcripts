# Trump's EPA Targeting Dozens Of Environmental Regulations | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk)
*  Observers are raising questions about the ethics of President Trump and Elon Musk, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=0.0s)]
*  who are showing off Tesla vehicles on the White House lawn this week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=4.64s)]
*  And a U.S. envoy is in Moscow today to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=8.08s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Senate Democratic leaders say they aren't going to support a Republican-drafted government spending bill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=17.92s)]
*  This boosts the chances of a partial federal government shutdown late tomorrow night. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=23.6s)]
*  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wants to push off that deadline for a month [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=28.4s)]
*  for bipartisan talks on spending. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=32.4s)]
*  The Agriculture Department is cutting about $1 billion worth of funding to schools and food banks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=34.8s)]
*  The programs let them buy food directly from local farmers and others. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=41.28s)]
*  This will hit school children's meals as well as people who depend on food banks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=45.04s)]
*  Farmers and ranchers who relied on the funding could also be hurt. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=50.24s)]
*  The Agriculture Department says the programs don't, quote, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=54.0s)]
*  effectuate the goals of the agency. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=57.52s)]
*  Officials in the education sector say they will fight plans by the U.S. Department of Education [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=60.16s)]
*  to cut its staffing levels by half. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=65.12s)]
*  And Piers Janaki-Metha reports President Trump says the reductions are part of his plan [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=68.0s)]
*  to eliminate the agency. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=72.8s)]
*  Trump says he wants to return education to the states, which, by the way, is already largely the case. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=74.48s)]
*  The federal government is responsible for about 10 percent of the money that goes to schools. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=80.8s)]
*  The rest comes from state and local governments. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=85.28s)]
*  Trump also said this about the layoffs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=87.92s)]
*  When we cut, we want to cut, but we want to cut the people that aren't working or not doing a good job. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  We're keeping the best people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=96.08s)]
*  But the layoffs look to be wide-ranging. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=97.52s)]
*  The Ed Department is set to go from 4,100 to 2,200 people in the coming days. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=100.16s)]
*  Janaki-Metha, NPR News. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=105.92s)]
*  The Trump administration is working to get rid of significant environmental rules in the U.S. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=108.0s)]
*  The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, said this was the greatest [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=113.52s)]
*  and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=119.04s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brady reports the decisions could increase the use of fossil fuels. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=123.12s)]
*  Zeldin said the agency will reconsider rules that limit climate pollution from power plants [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=128.16s)]
*  and from cars and trucks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=133.28s)]
*  Also, regulations that limit soot and mercury in the air. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=134.96s)]
*  Other rules that Zeldin claims are hurting the economy and costing trillions of dollars. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  But that leaves out the fact that pollution also costs the country, you know, in health costs and clean up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=143.44s)]
*  It's not clear whether EPA plans to get rid of these rules or weaken them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=149.52s)]
*  Those details should come later. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=153.68s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brady reporting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=155.28s)]
*  Some observers are raising questions about ethics in response to President Trump and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=157.68s)]
*  billionaire Elon Musk showing off Tesla vehicles outside the White House this week. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=162.16s)]
*  Trump said he was going to buy one. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen reports Musk is a major Trump campaign donor. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  Tesla vehicles, including a cyber truck, were arrayed on the South Lawn as Musk [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=173.84s)]
*  dazzled Trump like a salesman. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Richard Painter is a former ethics lawyer in the White House under George W. Bush. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=179.92s)]
*  He says the limits of what is ethical in the White House are being stretched. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=183.28s)]
*  The signal is that there's going to be an economy that's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=187.84s)]
*  treated by personal favoritism and government picking the winners and losers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=190.56s)]
*  So now government's going to pick Tesla as the winner. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=195.04s)]
*  The Trump Tesla photo up came as Tesla stock price tumbled and as Tesla storefronts and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=197.76s)]
*  superchargers have been hit with vandalism nationwide. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=202.0s)]
*  Trump now says violence against Tesla dealerships will be labeled as domestic terrorism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=204.72s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=210.24s)]
*  A federal judge has ruled that activist Mahmoud Khalil remained detained in Louisiana. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=212.56s)]
*  But the judge has ruled the permanent U.S. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=218.16s)]
*  resident who led protests against the Gaza War at Columbia University in New York [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=220.16s)]
*  cannot be deported without a hearing. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=225.28s)]
*  The Trump administration has not yet provided evidence for its claim. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Khalil supports terrorism. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  White House envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow today for talks with top Kremlin officials. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=234.16s)]
*  The main issue of discussion is Russia's reaction to a U.S. negotiated 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=238.88s)]
*  NPR's Charles Maines reports. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=244.64s)]
*  Under the proposal, the U.S. promised to restore military and intelligence support to Ukraine [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=246.72s)]
*  in exchange for Kiev agreeing to end air attacks against Russia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=251.68s)]
*  U.S. officials say the ball is now in Russia's court to reciprocate. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=255.2s)]
*  The Kremlin spokesman says Moscow has been studying the ceasefire offer but [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=258.64s)]
*  wants details directly from the White House. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=262.16s)]
*  Yet on the eve of U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff's arrival, Russian President [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=264.72s)]
*  Vladimir Putin signaled he may prefer a military solution. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=268.88s)]
*  Putin made a surprise visit to Russia's Kursk region where Kremlin forces appear [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=272.16s)]
*  on the verge of ending a months-long occupation by Ukrainian troops. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=276.24s)]
*  Dressed in camouflage, Putin instructed his generals to crush any remaining enemy forces. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=279.76s)]
*  Charles Maines, NPR News. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=284.72s)]
*  Today is the fifth anniversary of the police killing of Breonna Taylor in her home in Louisville, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=286.64s)]
*  Kentucky. Her slaying, along with the murders of other black Americans such as George Floyd, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=291.92s)]
*  sparked protests in 2020. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=297.44s)]
*  From Louisville Public Media, Roberto Roldan reports [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=299.68s)]
*  promised reforms in the Louisville Police Department are incomplete. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=302.8s)]
*  Louisville Congressman Morgan McGarvey marked the anniversary of Breonna Taylor's killing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=306.88s)]
*  on the House floor earlier this week. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=311.36s)]
*  While we will never forget how Breonna Taylor died, we get to choose to remember how she lived. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=313.6s)]
*  Breonna was a sister, a daughter, a girlfriend. Breonna was a caregiver [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  working at UofL's emergency room to save lives. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=324.24s)]
*  Taylor's death led to calls to ban no-knock warrants. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=327.04s)]
*  Local officials did just that in 2020, but the Kentucky legislature stopped short of an [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=330.08s)]
*  outright ban. Activists in Louisville are still waiting on comprehensive policing reform. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=335.03999999999996s)]

*  Public Investment Fund. The video game division makes hit games such as Pokemon Go. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=348.88s)]
*  That's where users walk around outdoors with devices trying to find creatures in virtual reality. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=354.47999999999996s)]
*  The sale is worth about $3.5 billion. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ob4EuhesGk&t=360.24s)]
