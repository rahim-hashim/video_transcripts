# World Leaders Condemn Israeli Airstrike On Refugee Camp | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg)
*  Closing arguments are expected in former President Donald Trump's New York criminal trial today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=0.0s)]
*  And search and rescue operations continue at the site of a deadly landslide in Papua, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=6.84s)]
*  New Guinea. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=12.68s)]

*  this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Bernstein reports attorneys for the prosecution and defense will present their [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=25.24s)]
*  closing arguments to the jury today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  The defense goes first and is expected to argue that Trump was not aware that his personal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=33.8s)]
*  attorney paid off an adult film star in the waning days of the 2016 campaign to keep quiet, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=38.08s)]
*  and that the attorney, Michael Cohen, is a convicted liar who cannot be trusted. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=43.16s)]
*  But the prosecution presented witness after witness and document after document to outline [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=47.94s)]
*  that Trump conspired with others right off the bat to work to suppress negative stories [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=53.64s)]
*  from women, authorized a payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, then okayed calling the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3zmjmKAyyg&t=57.96s)]
