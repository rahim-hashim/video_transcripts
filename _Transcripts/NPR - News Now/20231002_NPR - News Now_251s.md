# Swift's Appearance Drives Up Ticket Prices For Sunday's Chiefs-Jets Game | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ)
*  Former President Donald Trump's civil business fraud trial gets underway today in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And more than 75,000 health care workers at Kaiser Permanente are preparing to go on strike later this week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=5.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=11.76s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump says he will be at the state courthouse today in New York City. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=16.16s)]
*  He faces civil fraud charges that threaten some of his most iconic assets, including Trump Tower. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=20.56s)]
*  NPR's Brian Mann reports. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump and his associates, including his two sons, are accused of systematically overvaluing their properties [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=28.56s)]
*  by more than $2 billion in order to secure financing and make deals. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=34.32s)]
*  In one case, New York Attorney General Letitia James says they inflated the square footage of a building by 300 percent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Last week, state Judge Arthur Ngaran issued a summary judgment finding Trump did violate accounting rules. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=45.2s)]
*  Ngaran described Trump's valuations of his properties in financial statements as fantasy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=50.96s)]
*  Trump calls these claims a sham and says they're meant to cripple his presidential campaign. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=56.32s)]
*  If the fraud charges hold up in court, Trump could lose control of many of his prized assets [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=61.12s)]
*  and be forced to pay a $250 million fine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=65.6s)]
*  This civil trial is unrelated to four criminal trials Trump faces in state and federal courts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=69.12s)]
*  Brian Mann, NPR News, New York. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=74.0s)]
*  The federal government did not shut down over the weekend after Congress passed a short-term spending bill. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=75.84s)]
*  The legislation includes billions of dollars for U.S. emergency disaster help but not a cent for aid to Ukraine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=81.36s)]
*  When the bill got to the Senate, Colorado Democratic Senator Michael Bennett held it up for a time [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  until he got a commitment from leadership to debate funding for Ukraine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=93.36s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's Weekend All Things Considered. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=112.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz is seeking to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=115.84s)]
*  Gaetz says that McCarthy broke his promises to hardline House Republicans [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=121.84s)]
*  by working with Democrats to pass the spending bill. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  More than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers across the United States [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=129.84s)]
*  are preparing to go on strike for three days. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=135.12s)]
*  The walkout would start this Wednesday. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=138.08s)]
*  As NPR's Danielle Kaye reports, their union contract expired over the weekend. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=140.56s)]
*  These Kaiser workers whose contract expired on Saturday include nurses, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=146.08s)]
*  lab technicians, pharmacists and many others. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=150.32s)]
*  They're represented by a coalition of 12 unions that's bargaining with Kaiser, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=153.04s)]
*  one of the biggest health care providers in the U.S. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=157.28s)]
*  The unions say Kaiser hasn't offered adequate solutions to end a staffing crisis, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=160.08s)]
*  which they say is negatively affecting patient care and employees' well-being. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=164.96s)]
*  Kaiser and the unions say they're willing to keep bargaining to reach a deal on a new contract. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=169.52s)]
*  But if there's no agreement by Wednesday morning, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=174.48s)]
*  tens of thousands of workers will walk off the job. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=176.96s)]
*  Kaiser says hospitals and emergency departments would stay open in the event of a strike. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=180.0s)]
*  Danielle Kaye, NPR News. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=185.04s)]
*  Taylor Swift showed up at last night's NFL game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New York [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=186.96s)]
*  Jets. NPR's Emma Bowman reports that Swift's star power is giving the NFL a big opportunity [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  to cash in on her status. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=198.48s)]
*  The pop star returned to MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, but this time she wasn't the headliner. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=200.56s)]
*  Despite all the jokes on NBC's pre-game show, Football Night in America, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the era's tour continues. Taylor Swift is in the building. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=210.64s)]
*  Swift was there to support Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, but the Swifties still showed up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=215.2s)]
*  After the news dropped that the pop star would be there, the price for last-minute [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  cheap seats rose by 10% on the ticket marketplace game time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=224.88s)]
*  Swift arrived at the stadium with a gaggle of A-list celebs, but the talk was all Taylor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=228.96s)]
*  Swift's last showing at a Chiefs game drove up sales of Kelce's jersey by 400%. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=239.92s)]
*  Emma Bowman, NPR News. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2BBrAoIxNQ&t=247.84s)]
