**NPR - News Now:** [June 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY)
*  An impending deadline to retrofit planes with updated equipment may cause disruptions in air travel in the U.S. over the holiday weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=0.0s)]
*  And the White House is releasing plans to house homeless veterans. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=9.08s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=13.52s)]
*  The Biden administration is warning of potential disruptions in air travel over the holiday weekend. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=19.64s)]
*  Airline companies are up against a July 1st deadline to retrofit planes with updated equipment to prevent interference from transmissions by wireless companies. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=26.32s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says airlines need to plan accordingly over the next several days. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=37.32s)]
*  For those aircraft not yet upgraded, it is going to be an impact. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=44.56s)]
*  And so we're making sure the airlines have been reminded of their responsibility to operate realistic schedules. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And if they know that they're going to have equipment issues with these aircraft that are still waiting their turn to be upgraded, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=53.76s)]
*  they need to have that reflected in their schedules now so that passengers are not surprised or left in the lurch. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=58.96s)]
*  The administration says more than 80 percent of the domestic fleet serving airports has been updated. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=65.12s)]
*  Airlines have been forced to delay and cancel hundreds of flights within the U.S. this week, in part because of severe weather. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=71.6s)]
*  The White House is releasing new plans to help homeless veterans in the country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=79.84s)]

*  In fact, legal support can be the difference between becoming homeless in the first instance or having a safe, stable house and a roof over their heads. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=110.4s)]
*  The Department of Housing and Urban Development is also providing more than $3 billion to help communities address homelessness, including for homeless veterans. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=122.56s)]

*  More than 150 arrests were made during the latest wave of demonstrations Wednesday evening. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KwL_EICcqY&t=154.4s)]
