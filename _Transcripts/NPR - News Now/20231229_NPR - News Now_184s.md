**NPR - News Now:** [December 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, December 29th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=2.88s)]
*  Officials in Ukraine say Russia has launched its largest aerial assault this year. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=7.28s)]
*  NPR's Hannah Palmorenko reports from Kyiv 16 people have been killed and nearly 100 others have been wounded. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=11.68s)]
*  NPR's Hannah Palmorenko reporting. Thousands of Palestinian civilians are fleeing central Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=30.0s)]
*  The Israeli military is continuing to bombard that part of the enclave. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=50.56s)]
*  The Palestinians are moving to southern Gaza, but that area is already extremely overcrowded. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=54.96s)]
*  Maine is removing Donald Trump from the state's 2024 presidential primary ballot. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=61.44s)]
*  A ruling from Colorado's Supreme Court earlier this month resulted in the same decision. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=67.04s)]
*  As NPR's Windsor Johnston reports, both states cite Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=72.56s)]
*  Maine's Secretary of State, a Democrat, said she concluded that Trump used a false narrative [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=78.56s)]
*  or election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol to prevent the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=85.2s)]
*  certification of the 2020 election and the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=90.96s)]
*  Maine is the second state to remove the former president from the primary ballot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=96.56s)]
*  The Colorado state Supreme Court issued a similar ruling last week that will likely end up in front [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  of the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming weeks. The Trump campaign issued a statement pledging to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=108.4s)]

*  took on when interest rates were near zero during the pandemic. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=134.48000000000002s)]

*  and weren't able to borrow. That has led to an uptick in corporate bankruptcies. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=150.07999999999998s)]

*  That's a process aimed at cutting expenses, restructuring debt, and emerging a healthier company. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=169.84s)]
*  But some firms go under in the process. Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPzoekYojps&t=175.12s)]
