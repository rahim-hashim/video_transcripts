# Storms Kill 4, Leave 800,000 Without Power In Houston | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok)
*  Aid is now getting to Gaza through a temporary pier built by the U.S. military. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=0.0s)]
*  And at least four people are dead after severe weather ripped through Houston last night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kristen Wright with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Trucks loaded with humanitarian aid have begun moving into Gaza using a temporary floating [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=13.36s)]
*  pier constructed by the U.S. military. The aid is to be delivered to people in Gaza who are starving. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=19.28s)]
*  The Pentagon says no U.S. troops went ashore in Gaza. NPR's Jackie Northam reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=25.36s)]
*  This is the first shipment of humanitarian aid to use a 320 million dollar floating pier [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=31.84s)]
*  sitting in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Gaza. The aid, including food bars and hygiene [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=37.28s)]
*  kits, arrived at the pier by ships coming in from Cyprus, was loaded onto trucks and transported [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=42.8s)]
*  to Gaza using a causeway attached to the coast. The U.S. is only providing logistical support. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=48.56s)]
*  It's hoped that ultimately up to 150 trucks will drop off aid each day. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=54.72s)]
*  Much will depend on security in the area. Till now, most aid has been delivered over land, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=59.12s)]
*  but Israel has closed the main crossing in Ra'a and only limited amounts are coming through other [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=63.92s)]
*  borders. Jackie Northam, NPR News, Tel Aviv. Israel is to present its case to the International [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=68.96s)]
*  Court of Justice today about its military operation in Ra'a. During arguments Thursday, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=76.32s)]
*  South Africa appealed to the U.N.'s top court to order an end to Israel's operations against Hamas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=81.92s)]
*  In the U.S., at least four people have died in Houston after a severe storm ripped through [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=88.56s)]
*  the city last night. As Houston Public Media's Lucia Vasquez reports, nearly 800,000 people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=92.88s)]
*  are without power. The Houston area is a mess of shattered glass and tree limbs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=99.6s)]
*  City officials say the storm brought extreme winds of up to 80 miles per hour. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=105.44s)]
*  Made me wake up. You know, I almost died out here tonight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=110.0s)]
*  That was Elwood Webb, an unhoused man living in Houston. He said he was headed to a corner store [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=114.96s)]
*  when the storm came in. Hanging onto a pole and my legs were like, like, like up here in the air. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=120.56s)]
*  As of now, officials have not released much information about the four deaths. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=127.76s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Lucia Vasquez in Houston. Two Republican-led House committees advanced [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=132.32s)]
*  measures to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress. The committees want [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=138.32s)]
*  recordings of Special Counsel Robert Herr's interview with President Biden concerning Biden's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  handling of classified documents. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer here. The motion [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=148.56s)]
*  passes. Pursuant to this vote, the committee hereby adopts the report recommending that the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=153.68s)]
*  House of Representatives find Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=158.64s)]
*  refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by this committee. The White House is asserting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=164.08s)]
*  executive privilege over the audio. House Republicans do have the transcripts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  Herr said in his report, Biden should not be charged because he's quote, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  an elderly man with a poor memory. The full House would have to vote for Garland to be held [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  in contempt of Congress. This is NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip-T_FHjfok&t=183.44s)]
