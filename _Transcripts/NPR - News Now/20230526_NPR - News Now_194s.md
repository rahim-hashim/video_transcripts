*  An Indiana abortion provider is being sanctioned by the state's medical licensing board. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And expect the country's airports and highways to be more crowded than usual this holiday [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=5.24s)]
*  weekend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=10.34s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=11.34s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=12.34s)]
*  Indiana's medical licensing board is reprimanding an abortion provider who became the focus [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=16.52s)]
*  of attacks from conservative politicians last year. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=20.94s)]
*  She's been fined $3,000. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Dr. Kaitlin Bernard spoke publicly about providing an abortion to a young rape victim from Ohio [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=26.6s)]
*  after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=32.4s)]
*  NPR's Sarah McCammon has more. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=36.28s)]
*  Dr. Kaitlin Bernard's story of providing an abortion to an unnamed 10-year-old rape victim [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=38.28s)]
*  was first published by the Indianapolis Star. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=43.08s)]
*  Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita quickly began questioning Bernard's credibility in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  statements on Fox News and elsewhere. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  In a complaint with Indiana's medical licensing board, Rokita accused her of improperly disclosing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=53.36s)]
*  patient information. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=58.34s)]
*  Bernard's lawyer, Alice Moracle, responded during a hearing Thursday. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=60.32s)]
*  Physicians can talk to the media. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=64.52s)]
*  The question here and what is charged is that the physician shared, Dr. Bernard shared, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=66.4s)]
*  protected health information. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=71.28s)]
*  And the evidence will show that she did not share protected health information. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=73.4s)]
*  Board members fined Bernard but decided not to put her on probation, noting that she's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=76.82s)]
*  one of very few OBGYNs in Indiana who treat Medicaid patients. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Sarah McCammon, NPR News. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=85.6s)]

*  debt ceiling. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=92.12s)]
*  There has been no agreement yet to raise the nation's borrowing limit. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=93.12s)]
*  Highways and airports across the U.S. are expected to be crowded over the next several [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=97.52s)]
*  days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=101.84s)]

*  expects to fly 2.9 million passengers. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  America is expecting to carry 2.9 million travelers too, a delta 2.8 million, a whopping [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  17% increase over last year. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=119.92s)]
*  Nick Calio of the industry group Airlines for America says this could be the busiest [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=122.28s)]
*  summer for air travel ever. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  And that's why it's crucial that all parties work together. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=128.06s)]
*  That's the airports, the FAA, the air traffic controllers, the airlines, all work together [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=132.24s)]
*  to make sure that we have as few disruptions as possible. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=137.22s)]
*  Calio says the airlines have been on a hiring spree in hopes of averting a repeat of last [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=140.54s)]
*  summer's widespread flight delays and cancellations. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=144.9s)]
*  David Schaper, NPR News. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=148.14s)]

*  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will face his challenger, Kemal Kilicderolu. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=155.06s)]
*  NPR's Peter Kenyon says many voters were unhappy with their choices in the first round of Turkey's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=159.38s)]
*  elections two weeks ago. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=164.86s)]
*  After the first round, as I checked in with voters, the commas I heard most frequently [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=166.98s)]
*  reflected the sharp disappointment with Turkish politics in general, plus a lot of worries [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  for how long they can make ends meet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=176.06s)]
*  But there also seems to be a base of belief, maybe it's just a hope, that Erdogan is the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=178.38s)]
*  one to turn things around despite his unorthodox economic policies that some are blaming for [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=182.98s)]
*  the soaring inflation we see now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAQuarcOlOQ&t=190.1s)]
