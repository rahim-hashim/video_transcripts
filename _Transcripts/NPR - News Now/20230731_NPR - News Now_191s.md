# As Heat Moves East, Cities, People Of Color Hit Hardest | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI)
*  A convicted Michigan school shooter's sentencing hearing will resume tomorrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=0.0s)]
*  And an aid group says a New Hampshire nurse and her child have been kidnapped in Haiti. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=4.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  The heat wave is concentrating on the central U.S. today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=13.64s)]
*  Heat indexes will be well into the triple digits from Wichita to New Orleans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=17.04s)]
*  Health officials are warning people to do all they can to stay cool. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=21.82s)]
*  First, Sabrina Pacha is with the group Healthy Air and Water Colorado. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=26.4s)]
*  She says that's harder in communities of color, which often have fewer trees. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=30.84s)]
*  In Denver, we have a neighborhood that is 88 percent residents of color, and just 3 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  percent of their neighborhood has tree cover. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  In comparison to another part of the city where just 15 percent of residents are of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=44.08s)]
*  color, and they have upwards of 17 percent of tree cover. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=48.56s)]
*  Problems with heat are amplified in cities. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=53.0s)]
*  They're subject to something called the urban heat island effect. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=56.16s)]
*  Fewer trees and more asphalt make it tougher for urban areas to cool off. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=60.08s)]
*  A hearing resumes tomorrow to determine whether a convicted Michigan school shooter will get [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=65.08s)]
*  life in prison without parole. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=70.0s)]
*  Lawyers for Ethan Crumbly say he was so young at the time of the Oxford High School shooting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=72.36s)]
*  in 2021 that he can be rehabilitated. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=76.96s)]
*  From member station WDET, Quinn Kleinfelter has more. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Prosecutors described how then 15-year-old Ethan Crumbly took a handgun bought for him [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=84.96s)]
*  by his parents, calmly killed four students and shot seven other people, then waited to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=89.52s)]
*  see the pain he'd inflicted. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  They say that demands a life sentence without the chance for parole. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=96.36s)]
*  But the defense counters that 15-year-old brains are not fully developed, and Crumbly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  never received any mental health care. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=104.56s)]
*  An expert on prison rehabilitation, Dr. Kenneth Romanowski, said juveniles convicted of even [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  the most heinous crimes can reform. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=112.11999999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I think everybody has that potential to change. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=114.36s)]
*  And I think Mr. Crumbly would be no exception to that rule. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=117.52s)]
*  But I think he has to make that choice. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Defense attorneys say Crumbly himself might also take the stand. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Quinn Kleinfelter in Detroit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=126.32s)]
*  A relief group in Haiti says a nurse from New Hampshire and her child have been kidnapped [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=129.68s)]
*  in Haiti. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=134.64s)]
*  NPR's Joe Hernandez reports that last week, the State Department urged Americans to leave [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=135.64s)]
*  Haiti because of rising gang violence, crime and disease. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=141.4s)]
*  Elroy Haiti says on its website that Alex Dorsonville and her child were kidnapped from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=145.72s)]
*  the aid group's campus outside Port-au-Prince on Thursday. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=150.76s)]
*  Dorsonville is a nurse with the organization, as well as the wife of its founder. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=154.32s)]
*  In a statement, Elroy Haiti said, quote, Alex is a deeply compassionate and loving person [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=158.84s)]
*  who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian people her friends and family. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=163.8s)]
*  A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department says it has no higher priority than the safety [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=168.08s)]
*  and security of U.S. citizens overseas and that it's in contact with Haitian authorities. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  Unrest in the Caribbean nation has worsened recently with a rise in kidnappings and other [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=178.28s)]
*  violence committed by armed gangs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=183.0s)]
*  Joe Hernandez, NPR News. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=185.52s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaiBZWpMbI&t=188.08s)]
