# Trump Campaigns In A McDonald's Drive-Thru | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko)
*  Former President Donald Trump worked briefly at a McDonald's outside Philadelphia yesterday in a staged campaign event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=0.0s)]
*  And Elon Musk says he plans to give $1 million to Pennsylvania voters every day until Election Day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=6.8s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=13.8s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump campaigned in the swing state of Pennsylvania yesterday a little more than two weeks before Election Day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=18.3s)]
*  One of his stops was a McDonald's restaurant north of Philadelphia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=24.5s)]
*  Trump spent some time working the Fry's station and greeting customers at the drive-through window. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=28.200000000000003s)]
*  From Member Station WHYY, Carmen Russell Sluszanski reports. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=33.300000000000004s)]
*  The franchise shop was closed much of the day as the former president worked the fryer under detailed instructions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=37.7s)]
*  Then, during the highly staged campaign event, Trump delivered fast food through the drive-in window. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=44.3s)]
*  The preselected occupants of all six cars expressed their support before driving away. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=50.0s)]
*  And there'll be no charge. Trump is paying for it. Is that OK? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=55.1s)]
*  $1 million, 20-24. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=58.1s)]
*  Afterward, Trump talked to reporters through the window where he repeated his unproven claim that Vice President Kamala Harris never worked at McDonald's during college, as she has asserted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=59.3s)]
*  I've now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=69.1s)]
*  Outside, hundreds gathered to cheer him on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=72.1s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Carmen Russell Sluszanski in Philadelphia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=74.9s)]
*  Vice President Harris has responded to a flurry of negative and profane comments aimed at her by Trump over the past several days. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=78.3s)]
*  In an interview with Reverend Al Sharpton yesterday on MSNBC, Harris says that Americans deserve more. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=85.9s)]
*  What you see in my opponent, a former president of the United States, really is, it demeans the office. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=92.8s)]
*  And I have said, and I'm very clear about this, Donald Trump should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States. He has not earned the right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=103.5s)]
*  Harris will campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania today. Trump will campaign in North Carolina. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=110.5s)]
*  Tech billionaire Elon Musk is giving out $1 million to one Pennsylvania voter each day until Election Day. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=117.5s)]
*  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and some law experts say this might be illegal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  And Pierre's Luke Garrett has more. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=129.70000000000002s)]
*  On Saturday, Musk presented a Pennsylvania voter a giant check for a million dollars during a campaign event. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=132.0s)]
*  All the winner had to do was register to vote and sign Musk's political petition. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=137.4s)]
*  Governor Shapiro told NBC News that this move was deeply concerning. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=141.6s)]
*  I think it's something that law enforcement can take a look at. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=145.8s)]
*  I'm not the attorney general anymore at Pennsylvania. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=148.9s)]
*  I'm the governor, but it does raise some serious questions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  UCLA election law professor Rick Haasson says Musk's daily election sweepstakes are, quote, clearly illegal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  This is essentially a lottery that's open only to people who register to vote. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=160.8s)]
*  So it's either an incentive for someone to vote or it's a reward. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=165.9s)]
*  And either way, it violates federal law. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=170.0s)]
*  The tech mogul super PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=171.8s)]
*  Musk says the goal of this prize money is to support the Constitution. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=176.0s)]
*  Luke Garrett, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=180.0s)]

*  But many ordinary people use it as an alternative Islamic banking system in Lebanon, which has been mired in a severe economic crisis for years. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=203.3s)]
*  Israel's military hit multiple locations across southern and eastern Lebanon Sunday night [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=211.5s)]
*  after issuing evacuation orders. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=216.3s)]
*  In Beirut alone, there were at least 10 airstrikes on the southern suburb Dahya, a Hezbollah stronghold. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=218.5s)]
*  Aresu Rezvani, NPR News, Beirut. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=224.9s)]
*  The fresh strikes in Lebanon come as Secretary of State Antony Blinken departs today for Israel. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=227.10000000000002s)]
*  The State Department says he'll meet Israeli leaders and others in the Middle East this week. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=232.5s)]
*  An Islamic cleric based in the U.S. but accused of planning a failed coup in Turkey in 2016 has died, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=237.4s)]
*  according to news outlets that have published his sermons. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=243.8s)]
*  Fethullah Gulen was once an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but they fell out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=247.0s)]
*  Erdogan arrested tens of thousands of people he claimed were linked to Gulen's efforts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8GwGTuJDko&t=252.5s)]
