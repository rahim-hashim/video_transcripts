# March The 10th Month In A Row Of Record-Breaking Global Temperatures | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k)
*  Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=0.0s)]
*  Today is Friday, April 19th. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=1.0s)]
*  I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=2.84s)]
*  A U.S. official says Israel has launched a missile strike on Iran overnight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Iran has not confirmed this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=10.92s)]
*  Iranian media say an unknown object was shot down over the city of Isfahan and there were [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=12.56s)]
*  no injuries or damage on the ground. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=16.84s)]
*  NPR's Rob Schmitz says the strike comes after other exchanges between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=19.28s)]
*  This is apparently the latest escalation in what has been a tense tit for tat that began [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=24.32s)]
*  when an airstrike, which Iran blamed on Israel, killed two Iranian commanders in the country's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=29.48s)]
*  embassy compound in Syria April 1st, then followed by an unprecedented missile and drone [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=33.5s)]
*  attack that Iran launched on Israel last weekend, which was largely intercepted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=39.24s)]
*  NPR's Rob Schmitz reporting. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=43.56s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken was questioned by reporters last hour about the strike. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=45.6s)]
*  He would say only that the United States was not involved in any offensive operation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  Congress is another step closer to voting on a foreign aid package that includes funding [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=56.12s)]
*  for Israel and Ukraine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=60.72s)]
*  As NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports, this comes after lawmakers cleared a hurdle late last [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  night with bipartisan support. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  The Rules Committee has traditionally operated as an extension of the Speaker, and legislation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=70.16s)]
*  is usually advanced in a straight party line vote. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=75.0s)]
*  But to advance a foreign aid package, Democrats took the rare step of joining some Republican [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=78.2s)]
*  colleagues in voting yes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=83.0s)]
*  Three Republican members voted against the rule, in part out of anger that assistance [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=85.24s)]
*  to Ukraine wasn't paired with border security provisions, as Speaker Johnson had previously [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  pushed to do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  The rule will now head to the floor for a full vote of the House. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  Various pieces of the package are expected to pass with bipartisan coalitions this weekend. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  Barbara Sprunt and PR News, Washington. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Jury selection resumes today in New York for Donald Trump's criminal fraud trial. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=108.08s)]
*  Twelve jurors and one alternate are seated. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=112.44s)]
*  Prosecutors and Trump's defense lawyers must choose another five alternates. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Two seated jurors were excused yesterday. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=119.6s)]
*  One of them said she feared she would be publicly identified. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=122.7s)]
*  March was the tenth month in a row of record-breaking global temperatures. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  That's according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=131.2s)]
*  NPR's Rebecca Hirsch reports that is the second longest streak ever recorded. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=134.72s)]
*  Global average temperatures in March were hotter than any previous March going back [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=140.72s)]
*  to 1850, scientists say. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=144.06s)]
*  The previous nine months set similar records. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=146.22s)]
*  This ten-month streak is the second longest on record after a 13-month streak that happened [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=149.16s)]
*  in 2015 and 2016. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=153.48s)]
*  The cyclic climate phenomenon known as El Nino is partly to blame. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=156.0s)]
*  Heat records are often set during El Nino conditions, when the water in the equatorial [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=160.04s)]
*  Pacific is warmer, driving up temperatures worldwide. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  That exacerbates the larger warming trend from human-caused climate change. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=168.38s)]
*  The current El Nino cycle is waning and is expected to end in the coming weeks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=172.96s)]
*  Rebecca Hirscher, NPR News. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjAxJTs9F0k&t=177.62s)]
