# SCOTUS Affirmative Action Decision Could Have Wide-Ranging Impact  | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM)
*  Vice President Harris is concerned over the Supreme Court's decision striking down affirmative [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=0.0s)]
*  action in college admissions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And airlines are scrambling to make sure that recent flight problems don't disrupt travel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=6.76s)]
*  this holiday weekend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=10.9s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=11.9s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=12.9s)]
*  Colleges and universities are evaluating yesterday's opinion by the Supreme Court, ending the explicit [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=17.44s)]
*  consideration of race in college admissions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=22.16s)]
*  Vice President Harris says she and President Biden are concerned the effects of the ruling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=24.84s)]
*  will spill over into the business world. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=28.7s)]
*  So the president, I thought, was very clear about saying to corporate America that we [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=31.06s)]
*  would expect that this decision will not in any way cloud their judgment about the importance [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=38.06s)]
*  of diversity in the workplace. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=43.06s)]
*  Some industry groups such as the American Medical Association condemned the Supreme [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  Court ruling. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  The AMA says this undermines decades of progress centered on the educational value of diversity, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=49.86s)]
*  and it undermines the health of the nation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=55.5s)]

*  from Michigan to North Carolina. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=65.7s)]
*  One tracking site says the country's worst air quality this morning is in New York City. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=68.04s)]

*  A series of recent flight disruptions and problems plaguing the airline industry are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=80.68s)]
*  prompting concerns. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=85.32s)]
*  NPR's Kristen Wright reports today is a busy travel day for the holiday weekend. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=87.0s)]
*  A record four million people are expected to fly over July 4th as airlines scramble [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=91.8s)]
*  to reschedule thousands of passengers whose flights were delayed and canceled after storms. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=96.4s)]
*  United blames the Federal Aviation Administration and a shortage of air traffic controllers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=101.56s)]
*  Andrew Applebaum is with Flyers Rights. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=106.84s)]
*  This year in particular we're seeing pilot shortages, equipment shortages, and even air [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=109.12s)]
*  traffic control shortages. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=115.44s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says his department is investigating unrealistic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=117.52s)]
*  scheduling by the airlines and warning that planes won't be allowed to fly if they're [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=121.16s)]
*  not equipped to prevent wireless interference starting this busy travel weekend. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=125.84s)]
*  Kristen Wright, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  New York's embattled Republican Congressman George Santos is due back in a federal courtroom [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=133.04s)]
*  this morning. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=138.62s)]
*  NPR's Brian Mann reports Santos faces 13 criminal charges ranging from wire fraud to theft of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=139.78s)]
*  public funds. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=146.78s)]
*  Today's hearing on Long Island is expected to focus on scheduling and other procedural [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=148.34s)]
*  matters. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=152.38s)]
*  One question is how George Santos will balance the demands of his criminal trial with his [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=153.38s)]
*  long shot campaign for reelection. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=157.18s)]
*  Santos lied about much of his life story before winning office. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=159.74s)]
*  Many Republicans say they won't support his bid for a second term. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=163.02s)]
*  Speaking on Fox News, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Santos shouldn't run for reelection. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=166.26s)]
*  Santos fired back on Twitter saying McCarthy's comments do not change my intention of running. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=171.62s)]
*  But the court has already placed strict restrictions on Santos' travel and the timing of court [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=176.22s)]
*  dates could complicate his ability to fundraise and campaign. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=181.06s)]
*  Santos also faces a probe by the House Ethics Committee. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X3KjzNNsXM&t=185.01999999999998s)]
