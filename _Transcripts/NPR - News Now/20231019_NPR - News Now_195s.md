# Questions Remain Over Explosion At Gaza Hospital | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE)
*  Questions continue to swirl around a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=0.0s)]
*  And after two days and two ballots, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan still doesn't have [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=4.96s)]
*  the votes to become Speaker of the House. Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=9.6s)]
*  and here are today's top stories. President Biden is set to make a national address tonight [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=14.56s)]
*  from the Oval Office. He's expected to propose a significant aid package to support Israel and its [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=19.84s)]
*  war against Hamas and further aid to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. This comes as the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  president is also pledging $100 million in humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=30.8s)]
*  the West Bank. The president and the U.S. intelligence community do not believe at this point [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Israel was responsible for a deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital this week. The blast killed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=42.08s)]
*  hundreds of people. But as NPR's Greg Myrie reports, there's still a great deal of uncertainty [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  surrounding the blast and Israelis and Palestinians continue to blame each other. There are photos, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=53.6s)]
*  videos and eyewitness accounts of the huge explosion at the Al-Ahli Arab hospital, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=59.6s)]
*  but there's not yet clarity on who's responsible. The blast dug a relatively small hole in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=64.88s)]
*  hospital's parking lot and the hospital did not suffer structural damage. That suggests a smaller [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=70.48s)]
*  weapon was used. Israel says it was a rocket from a Palestinian faction that was directed at Israel [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=76.56s)]
*  but misfired. Palestinians insist the blast was part of Israel's ongoing bombing campaign. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=82.72s)]
*  President Biden says he believes the Israeli version, though U.S. officials say they're still [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=88.88s)]
*  gathering additional information. Greg Myrie, NPR News, Washington. After two days and two ballots, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=93.68s)]
*  Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan still doesn't have the votes to be elected speaker of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=100.88s)]
*  the house. NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports his opponents say he'll lose more support if he pushes for a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=106.0s)]
*  third vote today. Republican resistance to Jordan's bid for speaker appears to be hardening or even [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=112.08s)]
*  growing. It's been 16 days since California Representative Kevin McCarthy was ousted [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=118.08s)]
*  and the house is still frozen. It can't function until a speaker is elected. Calls to give the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=123.6s)]
*  temporary speaker, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, powers to allow votes on bills are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=129.36s)]
*  growing. McHenry says for now his role is limited. My role here is to be determined but I've [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=134.64s)]
*  constructed that as narrowly as the rules say I should and we can't transact business until [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=141.12s)]
*  we elect a speaker. Jordan's GOP opponents warn tactics of his allies to pressure them for votes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=147.04s)]
*  are dangerous. Two members who voted against Jordan say they receive death threats. Deirdre Walsh, NPR News. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=152.88s)]
*  The National Hurricane Center is watching Hurricane Norma off Mexico's Pacific Coast. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=160.08s)]
*  Hurricane specialist John Cangelosi says Norma is powerful. The category three maximum winds [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  in your 120 miles an hour and it's to the south of the southern portion of the Baja California [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=172.32s)]
*  Peninsula. It's about 450 miles south southeast of Cabo San Lucas. Meanwhile hurricane forecasters [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyPwTejCngE&t=178.72s)]
