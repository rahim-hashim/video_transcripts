# Israel Invades Lebanon For First Time Since 2006 | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, October 1st. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=0.0s)]
*  Officials in several southeastern states are trying to assess the catastrophic damage from Hurricane Helene. At least [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=6.82s)]
*  130 people have been killed and the toll is expected to rise. The mayor of Asheville, North Carolina [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=13.26s)]
*  says some 600 people in her city are unaccounted for. In Tennessee, tens of thousands of residents still don't have running water. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=18.52s)]
*  For Member Station WUOT, Pierce Gentry has more. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=26.6s)]
*  The Nolichucky River that winds through Greene County poured over its banks, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=30.12s)]
*  destroying four bridges and the county's water supply system. The water levels have almost returned to normal, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=34.88s)]
*  but most of the county's 70,000 residents remain without tap water. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  Local pastor Bob Radank is helping pass out cases of bottled water. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=46.0s)]
*  And so we've got a ton of volunteers that's come out here, and we had a truck driver come and bring the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=49.8s)]
*  huge thing of water, and they've been coming through. These volunteers have been loading these things up [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=55.12s)]
*  into the vehicles as the people come through. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=62.0s)]
*  Officials have not provided the timeline for when water will be restored, but it's estimated that it will take at least a week. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=64.44s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Pierce Gentry in Greenville, Tennessee. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=71.16s)]
*  A trial begins today over controversial new rules in Georgia for certifying election results. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=75.24s)]
*  The rules were passed by the embattled Georgia State Election Board. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=80.8s)]
*  They have sparked concerns about disruptions following the presidential election in November. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=84.48s)]
*  For Member Station WABE in Atlanta, Sam Greenglass has more. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=88.88s)]
*  The new rules seem to allow local election boards to vote against certifying election results if they find irregularities [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=93.12s)]
*  they cannot rectify on their own. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=99.72s)]
*  But Georgia's Republican Secretary of State says local boards do not have this discretion and must certify election results by the state deadline. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  The plaintiffs, including the State Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee, want a judge to affirm that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=109.44s)]
*  The three Republicans on the state election board have come under fire for muscling through several last-minute election rule changes, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=115.96s)]
*  including hand counting the number of ballots cast on Election Day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=122.83999999999999s)]
*  Several lawsuits are now challenging that measure as well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=126.44s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sam Greenglass in Atlanta. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  Israeli troops have crossed into Lebanon for the first time since 2006. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=132.76s)]
*  Israel says the goal is to push back Hezbollah militants from the border in Lebanon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=137.64s)]
*  Israel wants to create a buffer zone and allow thousands of Israeli civilians to return to their houses. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=141.96s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf says Israeli officials are calling this a limited incursion. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=147.88s)]
*  The Israeli military is calling these quote, limited and localized raids, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=153.64s)]
*  but we've heard them use this language before in parts of Gaza and Israel is still fighting a war there nearly a year later. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=157.48s)]
*  So there are some real questions about what that really means. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=163.8s)]
*  They also put out a statement saying that the troops that went into Lebanon first were the same brigades that have been operating in Gaza, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=167.4s)]
*  noting that these troops gained skills and operational experience that they are going to be using in the north. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=173.48s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reporting. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=178.84s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglGSdXjA8o&t=181.4s)]
