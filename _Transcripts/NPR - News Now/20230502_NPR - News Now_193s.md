# Hollywood's Writers Go On Strike | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ)
*  Hollywood's writers are on strike for the first time in 15 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Biden will meet next week with top congressional leaders to discuss raising the nation's borrowing limit. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=4.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  TV and movie writers have begun a strike against the major Hollywood studios. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=14.8s)]
*  As NPR's Mandelit Del Barco reports, the two sides failed to agree on a new deal before the contract expired at midnight. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=19.8s)]
*  It's the first time in 15 years members of the Writers Guild of America have gone on strike. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=27.6s)]
*  The last time, it went for 100 days, shutting down Hollywood productions as writers demanded to be paid more for work on movies and shows sold as DVDs and Internet downloads. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  This time, union leaders say part of their beef has to do with residuals from streaming. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=43.8s)]
*  In anticipation of the strike, studio executives have reportedly been stockpiling scripts and prepping more reality shows that don't need scriptwriters. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=48.6s)]
*  Unions for Hollywood actors and those working behind the scenes voted to support the WGA. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  Mandelit Del Barco, NPR News. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  President Biden is set to meet next week with the four top congressional leaders. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=64.8s)]
*  They are to discuss the debt ceiling. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  But NPR's Giles Snyder says that does not necessarily mean there's been a breakthrough. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=71.8s)]
*  The White House is sticking to its call for Congress to pass a clean bill that raises the government's debt ceiling and avoids a first ever default. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=77.0s)]
*  The president says he will not negotiate over the issue, but he did call top lawmakers, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, to arrange the May 9th White House meeting after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the U.S. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  could potentially default as soon as June 1st. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=97.8s)]
*  Biden has not met with McCarthy since February. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder prepared that report. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=102.8s)]
*  The Senate Judiciary Committee hears testimony today focused on whether there should be a code of conduct for the U.S. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=105.8s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=112.5s)]
*  But as NPR's Nina Totenberg reports, none of the members of the court itself will be there to testify. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  A wave of investigative stories in the media in recent weeks have precipitated new charges of corruption at the nation's highest court. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=120.0s)]
*  Though many of the stories feature conduct that's perfectly legal, the cumulative effect has led to a further spiral downward in public confidence in the court. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  Legal ethics experts, by and large, have called for the court to write its own code of conduct, and there are several such proposals in Congress. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  But with the filibuster rule in the Senate and the House in Republican hands, there seems to be little likelihood for any of these to be enacted. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  A Missouri judge has extended a hold on a rule that would restrict or eliminate gender-affirming medical care for all transgender people, both children and adults, in Missouri. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=158.0s)]
*  The rule, imposed solely by the Missouri Attorney General, requires all trans people to meet a long list of requirements first before obtaining medical care. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=169.5s)]
*  The judge's hold is for two more weeks. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=179.5s)]
*  It allows the Missouri court to look at the merits of a lawsuit against Attorney General Andrew Bailey. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=182.1s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmimKU5H8WQ&t=189.1s)]
