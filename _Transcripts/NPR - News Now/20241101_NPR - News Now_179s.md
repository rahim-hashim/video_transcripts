# Trump Repeats False Claims Of Widespread Election 'Cheating' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, November 1st. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=2.72s)]
*  The presidential candidates will campaign in more swing states today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=6.48s)]
*  Yesterday, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump were in the southwest. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=10.0s)]
*  Harris held a rally in Phoenix. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Later in the day, Trump met supporters in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=16.88s)]
*  NPR's Ben Giles reports Trump spoke with former Fox primetime star Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=20.8s)]
*  In the final days of his campaign, Trump said he was confident he'd win on Tuesday, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  and sowed the seeds for his supporters to doubt the results if he's defeated by Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=30.4s)]
*  We're doing very well. I think we're leading by a lot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  And if we can keep them, if we can keep that cheating down, because there are a bunch of cheats, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=40.48s)]
*  if we can keep that cheating down, we're going to have a tremendous victory, I think. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=46.4s)]
*  Trump also echoed a conspiracy theory that Democrats may be allowing immigrants into the country to let them vote illegally. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  Ben Giles, NPR News, Phoenix. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=56.32s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump often falsely claims that there is widespread cheating in elections. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=58.56s)]
*  There is no evidence of this, nor has Trump ever provided any. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=63.84s)]
*  At her rally in Phoenix, Vice President Harris criticized Trump over a comment this week. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=68.32s)]
*  He said he would protect women whether they like it or not. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=73.52s)]
*  Then Trump said he was going to protect women from migrants coming in. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  But Harris says Trump's comment is offensive to women because it shows that he would also limit women's rights and access to abortion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=81.36s)]
*  He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=97.44s)]
*  But we trust women. We trust women. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Both Harris and Trump will campaign today in Wisconsin. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=107.44s)]
*  Trump will also go to Michigan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=111.04s)]
*  The Biden administration says thousands of North Korean troops are now positioned on the border between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports officials fear that these troops could soon be in combat with Ukrainian troops. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=121.12s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.S. believes there are 10,000 North Korean soldiers in Russia right now, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=128.56s)]
*  as many as 8,000 of them in the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=135.68s)]
*  And Blinken says this makes Russian President Vladimir Putin look weak. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=140.24s)]
*  Putin has been throwing more and more Russians into a meat grinder of his own making in Ukraine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=144.64s)]
*  Now he's turning to North Korean troops and that is a clear sign of weakness. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=149.92s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the U.S. doesn't know what Russia is giving North Korea in exchange, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=154.72s)]
*  but the U.S. analysts say China is none too happy about this level of coziness between Russia and North Korea. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=160.64s)]
*  The U.S. is working diplomatic channels to urge China to intervene. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, the State Department. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=172.32s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__IaN3CofE&t=175.76s)]
