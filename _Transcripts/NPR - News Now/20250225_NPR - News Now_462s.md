*  council resolution and drafted its own. That called for a quick end to the war [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=36.92s)]
*  but NPR's Michelle Kellerman says it does not specify Russia launched a full [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=41.68s)]
*  scale invasion in 2022. While the U.S. said this is just a first step to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=45.400000000000006s)]

*  resources. There's growing confusion over whether federal employees are required [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=76.12s)]
*  to respond to a government wide email sent last Saturday asking them to list [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  five accomplishments from the past week. The Office of Personnel Management [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=85.44s)]

*  review responses and evaluate non responses. The guidance also says [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=98.56s)]
*  agencies should decide whether to take action against employees who don't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=102.48s)]
*  answer. But earlier Monday a government memo obtained by NPR indicated OPM [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  said something different. It was telling agencies that responses were voluntary. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=110.76s)]
*  Adding to the confusion over the weekend, the departments of state defense [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=114.88s)]

*  Colorado River is used. Billions of dollars have been set aside to help [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOal3ILcl8&t=186.24s)]
