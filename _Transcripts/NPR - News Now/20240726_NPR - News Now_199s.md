# France's High-Speed Rail Sabotaged Ahead Of Opening Ceremonies | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk)
*  The investigation continues into the man who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump earlier this month. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=0.0s)]
*  And Canada's women's soccer team's head coach has been dismissed hours before the Olympics are set to get underway in Paris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=6.4s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=13.8s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet former President Donald Trump today in Florida. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, Netanyahu was at the White House where he met President Biden and families of American hostages held by Hamas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=24.099999999999998s)]
*  He also met separately with Vice President Harris. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=30.5s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid says the vice president made a statement after her meeting that had a slightly different tone than Biden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=33.1s)]
*  She was also more direct than Biden in the empathy she expressed for Palestinian civilians, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=39.8s)]
*  words using some words, you know, that this administration has not used before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=45.5s)]
*  I think what was noticeable was that collectively this speech felt like one of the first times that we heard the vice president speak on foreign policy more in her own voice rather than just as an emissary for Biden. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=49.7s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid reporting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=61.5s)]
*  Federal investigators have still not found a motive for the 20-year-old man who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  As NPR's Bobby Allen reports, former classmates of the government say he was quiet and appeared to be socially isolated. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=71.0s)]
*  When the Trump shooter was identified, Zach Herring couldn't believe it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=78.2s)]
*  Herring had taken community college courses with a gunman, Thomas Crooks, and remembers a straight A student who was mild-mannered and never discussed politics. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=81.5s)]
*  In group projects, Herring says the 20-year-old was always the standout. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  Just all he would talk about was, you know, whatever we were working on at the time. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=93.3s)]
*  Just very like flat, emotionless, you know, it almost seemed like easy to him, like he was just, you know, waiting for like everybody to catch up to him and then like, you know, move on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  Authorities say Crooks searched details about the assassination of John F. Kennedy before the shooting and cased the Pennsylvania rally site by flying a drone over it before the event. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=106.8s)]
*  But investigators say he left no manifesto and barely used social media. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=116.2s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News, Bethel Park. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=120.3s)]
*  Hours before the opening ceremonies at the Summer Olympics in Paris, there have been coordinated attacks on France's national high-speed rail lines. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  Some of the overnight attacks included arson. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=131.4s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of French rail passengers have been told to postpone their trips. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=134.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Olympic play, the head coach of Canada's women's soccer team has been dismissed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=139.5s)]
*  Steve Futterman has more from Paris. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=145.10000000000002s)]
*  This all has to do with a growing spy scandal with the defending gold medalists accused of flying a drone over the practice sessions of its opponents. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=147.3s)]
*  The Canadian team was detected using a drone over the practice of its first opponent, New Zealand. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=156.3s)]
*  Those teams played yesterday with Canada winning 2-1. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=162.2s)]
*  For that match, Canada's coach, Beb Priestland, voluntarily suspended herself and two others were sent home, including an assistant coach. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=165.6s)]
*  Now, Canadian officials have removed Priestland for the remainder of the Olympics, after what it calls evidence of similar drone action in the past. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  In 2021, Canada was accused of using a drone to spy on the Honduras team before a World Cup qualifier. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Paris. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=190.6s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsB6NuOEXIk&t=193.79999999999998s)]
