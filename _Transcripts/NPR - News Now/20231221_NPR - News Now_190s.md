# Texas Flying Undocumented Migrants To Chicago | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4)
*  Negotiations for another ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be underway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=0.0s)]
*  And Texas Governor Greg Abbott says he has started to fly undocumented migrants seeking asylum to Chicago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=5.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=11.6s)]
*  Talks are underway for a possible pause in fighting in the Israel-Gaza war. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=16.0s)]
*  And BRS Jason DeRose reports on the negotiations. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=20.0s)]
*  Diplomats from Israel and Qatar, backed by the U.S., have been meeting in Europe to work out some sort of a deal, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=23.0s)]
*  according to U.S. officials. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=28.6s)]
*  And Hamas says that one of its senior leaders, Ismael Haniyeh, was in Cairo. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  Egypt has been playing a role in ceasefire talks as well. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=34.6s)]
*  Hamas is still believed to be holding more than 100 Israeli hostages. Israel wants them back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=37.6s)]
*  During the first ceasefire, Hamas released hostages each day in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=43.6s)]
*  Separately, the United Nations Security Council is trying to pass a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause in fighting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=50.6s)]
*  A vote on that continues to be delayed over language acceptable enough to avoid a U.S. veto. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=57.6s)]
*  Jason DeRose, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=62.6s)]
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott says he is starting to fly undocumented migrants seeking asylum to Chicago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=65.6s)]
*  He says the Biden administration is to blame for failing to secure the U.S. border. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=71.6s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people have crossed into the U.S. this month. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=75.6s)]
*  Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzalez says this is breaking local Texas resources. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=79.6s)]
*  Imagine something happens to you. You die on 9-1-1 and you cannot go to the hospital because there are no beds, because all the beds are filled. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=86.6s)]
*  I'm not making this up. This is where we're at. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=95.6s)]
*  Senate negotiators continue to work on federal immigration reform. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=99.6s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued a joint statement this week. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=103.6s)]
*  They both say the negotiators are making, quote, encouraging progress. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=109.6s)]
*  President Biden says courts will decide if former President Donald Trump should be pulled from Colorado's presidential primary ballot next year for apparently engaging in insurrection. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=113.6s)]
*  Biden says there's, quote, no question Trump supported insurrection on January 6th. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=123.6s)]
*  The once popular electric scooter company, Bird, has filed for bankruptcy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=129.6s)]
*  As NPR's Bobby Allen reports, the tech company cited scores of injury-related lawsuits as part of the reason it became insolvent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=134.6s)]
*  Bird helped jumpstart a so-called micro-mobility movement in the 2010s by flooding sidewalks around the world with electric scooters that could be unlocked with a phone app. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=143.6s)]
*  The company pitched scooters as an environmentally friendly alternative to cars, but it often entered cities without approval from local lawmakers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=152.6s)]
*  The scooters both delighted and frustrated city residents. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=159.6s)]
*  Scooters ended up in rivers and lakes, and people crashed them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=163.6s)]
*  Bird says the decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection was partially related to the more than 100 personal injury lawsuits it faced. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=167.6s)]
*  But also, Bird said it expanded too fast during the pandemic and has now ran out of cash. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=175.6s)]
*  It will now try to reorganize its debt and emerge a leaner company. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=180.6s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=184.6s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m1wpfAryW4&t=186.6s)]
