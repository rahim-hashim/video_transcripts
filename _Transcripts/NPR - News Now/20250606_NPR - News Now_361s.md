*  President Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have had a spectacular falling out. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=17.04s)]
*  It went public yesterday as Musk increased his criticism of the multi-trillion dollar spending [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=21.52s)]
*  and tax cut bill that is being reviewed by the Senate. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=26.48s)]
*  Musk wants lawmakers to reject it, saying it will supersize the deficit. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=29.44s)]
*  Trump criticized Musk and suggested he could pull U.S. contracts with Musk's private company, SpaceX. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=33.84s)]
*  NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Lehman says the breakup between two of the world's most powerful men [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=40.480000000000004s)]

*  Trump brought in this businessman, gave him sweeping power, but it wasn't a one-way street. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=50.88s)]
*  Musk spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=55.2s)]
*  So yesterday, Musk made it clear he thought he deserved more in return. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wMub1ke6b4&t=59.040000000000006s)]
