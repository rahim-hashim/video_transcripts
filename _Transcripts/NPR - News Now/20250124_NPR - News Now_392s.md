**NPR - News Now:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k)
*  President Trump pardons several anti-abortion activists ahead of today's March for Life in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=0.0s)]
*  And Trump's nominee for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to be confirmed by the Senate later today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=6.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=12.4s)]
*  President Trump will view disaster relief efforts today on two sides of the country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=16.7s)]
*  He's traveling to Los Angeles. He's hinted this week he could withhold wildfire relief aid to California. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=20.7s)]
*  And bear's deepest shiver on reports, Trump will first fly to North Carolina. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=27.099999999999998s)]
*  Trump is headed to Asheville, which was ravaged by flooding when Hurricane Helene hit the state in September. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=31.099999999999998s)]
*  Trump has accused Democrats of leaving the state behind. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=36.6s)]
*  He repeatedly made a number of false statements about aid relief during the presidential election, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=39.9s)]
*  using the crisis to score political points. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=44.9s)]
*  The president's next stop will be L.A., where wildfire recovery will be costly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=47.8s)]
*  Trump appears to regard this, too, as an opportunity for political leverage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=52.5s)]
*  In an interview this week with Sean Hannity on Fox, Trump said Democrats wanted a lot of money for wildfire relief in California, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=56.5s)]
*  but he wants the state to change its water policies before it gets any aid. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=64.1s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News, The White House. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=68.7s)]
*  President Trump has pardoned some anti-abortion activists who were convicted of blocking the entrances to women's clinics that perform abortions. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=71.2s)]
*  His action comes ahead of today's March for Life by anti-abortion activists in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=79.9s)]
*  Vice President Vance is expected to address the gathering. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=86.1s)]
*  As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, activists are gathering at a time when conservatives control all three branches of government. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  President Trump has bragged about his role in choosing Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  But since then, he's offered mixed messages about whether he'd support new federal restrictions, as some activists are calling for. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=102.6s)]
*  Trump's vice president, J.D. Vance, is set to address the march in person, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  his first public appearance since the inauguration. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=114.3s)]
*  Here's Vance at the Ohio March for Life in 2023. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=117.3s)]
*  For the millions of babies as yet unborn in this country, we are going to fight for you every step of the way. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=120.7s)]
*  There are many steps to take, and I'll be right there walking with you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=127.10000000000001s)]

*  and they claim they've deported more out of the country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=143.1s)]
*  Officials in Newark, New Jersey, say agents raided a city business yesterday. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  But Newark's mayor says immigration agents also detained American citizens, including an American military veteran. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  The mayor says people are being unlawfully terrorized. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=158.5s)]
*  The raids come as a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for some Americans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=162.0s)]
*  California Attorney General Rob Bonta noted the federal judge described Trump's actions as unconstitutional. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  We expect that similar reception from courts throughout the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=177.5s)]
*  Any court that is fair, that is objective, that looks at the facts and applies the law, I believe we'll find the same way. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=182.2s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's all things considered. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=187.5s)]

*  His nomination cleared a procedural vote yesterday. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=196.6s)]
*  The full Senate vote could happen today. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=200.0s)]
*  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports two Republican senators say they will vote against Hegseth. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=202.4s)]
*  Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski announced she could not support Hegseth, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=207.8s)]

*  Hot For You Baby was originally destined for Tina Turner's blockbuster 1984 album Private Dancer, but it didn't make the cut. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=325.9s)]
*  The song languished forgotten for roughly 40 years until Turner's record label rediscovered the master tape. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=334.79999999999995s)]

*  But you know, it's got energy and it's got power and it's got excitement. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  The critic says, most importantly, it makes us feel like Tina Turner, who died in 2023, is a bit of a rock star. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. will publicly unveil two giant pandas today. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=362.7s)]
*  Ching Bao, a female, and Bao Li, a male, are giant pandas that are on a decade-long loan from China. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyc6jwnpO3k&t=370.7s)]
