# ICE Takes Tufts University Graduate Student Into Custody | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8)
*  Federal immigration agents have arrested another international student for pro-Palestinian advocacy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=0.0s)]
*  And the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a Biden-era rule regulating ghost guns. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=5.9s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=10.8s)]
*  President Trump says he'll impose 25 percent tariffs on all automobile imports. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=15.3s)]
*  These are supposed to start April 2nd. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  It's the same day Trump says he'll impose reciprocal tariffs on other nations that have tariffs on U.S. products. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  And NPR's Franco Ordonia says that's on top of aluminum and steel tariffs that Trump is imposing as well as on other goods. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=28.3s)]
*  And he argues that they're an important tool to be used for leverage on things like national security and other U.S. interests. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  But most economists say tariffs raise prices for consumers and that could hurt the economy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=43.5s)]
*  Trump often uses them as a negotiating tool. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=50.7s)]
*  And that has really made economists even more worried. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=53.9s)]
*  And that's because of the uncertainty that they cause. And you see that in the markets. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=58.1s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordonia is reporting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=62.6s)]
*  Federal immigration agents have arrested another foreign-born student for her pro-Palestinian advocacy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=65.1s)]
*  NPR's Adrienne Florido reports she's a Tufts University doctoral student who was picked up near her apartment outside Boston. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=71.4s)]
*  A security camera captured six agents, most in plain clothes and covering their faces, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=79.3s)]
*  surrounding a startled Drumesa Ozturk as she was about to cross the street Tuesday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=84.0s)]
*  Ozturk's lawyer says she's a Turkish national on a student visa. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=90.8s)]
*  Last year she co-wrote an op-ed criticizing Tufts University leaders for not condemning Israel's bombardment of Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  In a statement, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman accused her without evidence of engaging in activities in support of Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=101.7s)]
*  The same claim the government has made about other non-citizens arrested for deportation in recent weeks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=109.7s)]
*  Shortly after Ozturk's arrest Tuesday, a federal judge ordered the government to keep her in Massachusetts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=115.4s)]
*  But a day later, records showed her as being held at a detention center in Louisiana. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=121.2s)]
*  Adrienne Florido, NPR News. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a Biden-era rule. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=127.4s)]
*  It requires serial numbers and background checks for firearms made from kits. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=130.9s)]
*  But as NPR's Martin Acosty reports, gun kit designers are not giving up. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=135.6s)]
*  The high court found that kits that supply almost everything to quickly and easily make guns are in fact guns and subject to federal firearms regulations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=140.1s)]
*  Gun kit pioneer Cody Wilson says his company is already adapting, making kits that he hopes the courts will not see as guns under this ruling. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=149.3s)]
*  I see a new set of products that take a little longer to make. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=157.3s)]
*  You don't send every single part in the same box and you use uncommon tools. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=160.4s)]
*  Gun control groups welcomed the Supreme Court's decision, saying the Biden regulation had decreased the number of crimes involving untraceable ghost guns made from mass produced kits. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=164.5s)]
*  Martin Acosty, NPR News. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=174.9s)]
*  The opposition party in South Sudan says that its leader, the country's vice president, has been arrested. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=176.8s)]
*  The United Nations is warning his arrest comes as South Sudan is back on the brink of civil war. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=183.3s)]
*  The Secretary of Homeland Security has visited a notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=190.0s)]
*  NPR's Ada Peralta reports that's where the U.S. recently deported more than 200 Venezuelans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=195.9s)]
*  Federal courts are reviewing whether the Trump administration can summarily deport Venezuelans suspected of being gang members. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=201.8s)]
*  Earlier this month, they sent more than 200 to the Secot, a prison the Salvadoran government has used to jail members of the gang MS-13. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=208.1s)]
*  The Salvadoran government has touted the tough measures in the prison and the fact that the prisoners will never be allowed out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=216.1s)]
*  The Secretary of Homeland Security toured the prison but didn't talk to prisoners. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=222.7s)]
*  At the end, she recorded a warning. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=226.6s)]
*  If you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=228.7s)]
*  Noem thanked El Salvador for jailing who she called, quote, our terrorists. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=232.4s)]
*  Family members of some of the prisoners have said they are not gang members at all. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=237.0s)]
*  Ada Peralta, NPR News, Mexico City. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=241.7s)]
*  A bill is advancing in the Florida legislature that would remove current child labor protections for 16 and 17 year olds. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=244.1s)]
*  From member station WFSU, Tristan Wood reports their employers could require them to work full time and even overnight on school days. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=251.8s)]
*  Supporters say the bill would allow parents and families to make decisions about their children. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=261.3s)]
*  Critics are saying it's coming up now to make up for labor shortages in the state due to crackdowns on immigration. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=266.5s)]
*  They're pointing to these comments Florida Governor Ron DeSantis made at an immigration roundtable last week. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=273.5s)]
*  Why do we say we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when, you know, teenagers used to work at these resorts? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=279.4s)]
*  College students should be. All this stuff. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=288.1s)]
*  Loosening child labor protections has become a growing trend in recent years, with over a dozen states reducing their protections. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=290.7s)]
*  It's unclear if this bill has the votes to pass. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=298.3s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Tristan Wood in Tallahassee. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=301.2s)]
*  I'm Cora McCollum in NPR News in Washington. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT58ggYpZZ8&t=303.8s)]
