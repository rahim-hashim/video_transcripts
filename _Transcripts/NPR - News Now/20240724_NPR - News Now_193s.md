# Netanyahu Addresses Congress This Afternoon | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will speak at a joint meeting of Congress this afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=0.0s)]
*  And new abortion restrictions in Iowa are set to go into effect next week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=5.44s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=10.24s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to a joint meeting of Congress this afternoon amid the ongoing war in Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=14.52s)]
*  As NPR's Greg Myrie reports from Tel Aviv, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=21.56s)]
*  The Israeli leader can expect strong support from Republicans and sharp criticism from many Democrats. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli leader comes under daily criticism at home and in much of the world for his handling of the war against Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  One of the few places he can find strong backing is among Republicans in the U.S. Congress. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=37.56s)]
*  However, a growing number of congressional Democrats say they are boycotting the speech. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=42.96s)]
*  The most prominent Democrat who won't attend is Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=47.84s)]
*  The vice president traditionally sits behind a foreign leader who's addressing Congress, but Harris has cited a scheduling conflict. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=52.720000000000006s)]
*  Netanyahu is planning to meet separately with Harris, President Biden and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump later this week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=60.32s)]
*  Greg Myrie, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  President Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=71.36s)]
*  He's expected to discuss why he ended his bid for reelection, and he's likely to talk about how he plans to complete his presidency. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=74.92s)]
*  Biden returned to the White House yesterday after recovering from COVID at his Delaware home. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=83.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump will be in North Carolina today for a rally. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=88.56s)]
*  It's his first campaign event since Biden ended his reelection bid and Vice President Harris secured enough delegates to become the likely Democratic presidential nominee. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=92.72s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ortones has more. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  The former president is expected to use the rally to turn his attention to his likely next opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=106.12s)]
*  On a call yesterday with reporters, former President Trump sought to paint Harris and President Biden's record as one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=113.64s)]
*  She's the same as Biden, but much more radical. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=120.76s)]
*  She's a radical left person, and this country doesn't want a radical left person to destroy it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  While not the official nominee yet, Harris appears to have built enough support among Democratic delegates to become her party's nominee against Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=128.48s)]
*  Trump carried North Carolina in his two previous campaigns, but the margin was so small in 2020 that Democrats see an opportunity to flip the state. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=137.0s)]
*  Franco Ortones, NPR News. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=145.64s)]
*  A state judge in Iowa has ruled a law that bans abortion as early as six weeks of pregnancy will go into effect next week. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=148.28s)]
*  Iowa Public Radio's Natalie Krebs reports. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=156.68s)]
*  A Polk County judge has ruled to dissolve the law's temporary injunction starting at 8 a.m. next Monday. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=159.4s)]
*  This follows an Iowa Supreme Court ruling last month that found the law could go into effect. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=165.32s)]
*  The law bans abortion when cardiac activity is detected, which can be as early as six weeks of pregnancy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  Planned Parenthood, which operates four clinics in Iowa, has estimated the law will block the vast majority of abortions in the state. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=177.72s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Natalie Krebs in Des Moines. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=186.12s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn3LRqCq8wk&t=189.56s)]
