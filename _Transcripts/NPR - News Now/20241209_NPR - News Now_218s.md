# U.S. Bombs Targets In Syria After Assad Flees | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE)
*  The U.S. bombed dozens of ISIS targets in central Syria yesterday after the country's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=0.0s)]
*  longtime dictator fled the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=5.0s)]
*  And South Korea's president is now being investigated for treason and abuse of power. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=7.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  A Syrian rebel group says it's now controlling Syria's capital, Damascus. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  The Kremlin says former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been given asylum in Russia. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=20.22s)]
*  It's not clear who will now run Syria, but one main rebel group says it's willing to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=25.34s)]
*  work with all Syrians. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=29.4s)]
*  The U.S. does not want one of those groups to be Islamic State. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=31.08s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the U.S. bombed 75 ISIS targets in central Syria yesterday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=34.64s)]
*  We're still evaluating the results, but I think that we're going to find that we've [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=41.32s)]
*  been pretty successful. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=47.36s)]
*  But that's focused on ISIS, to keep the pressure on ISIS and to deny them the ability to easily [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=49.4s)]
*  research. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  There are reports that Israel has also bombed areas in Syria, singling out places that allegedly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=56.92s)]
*  held stashes of the former regime's chemical weapons. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=62.2s)]
*  Israel has also moved across the unofficial border into Syria. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=66.16s)]
*  Israel is seeking to control a buffer zone to stop militants from attacking. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=69.92s)]
*  South Korea's Justice Ministry has slapped a travel ban on that country's president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=74.68s)]
*  NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=79.08s)]
*  President Yoon Song-Yul is under investigation for treason and abuse of power following his [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=81.6s)]
*  failed attempt to declare martial law. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=86.2s)]
*  Yoon has been booked as a suspect by both police and special corruption investigators. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=88.64s)]
*  On Saturday, Yoon escaped impeachment when his party's lawmakers boycotted a vote in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=93.76s)]
*  parliament. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=98.12s)]
*  On Sunday, South Korea's prime minister and the head of the ruling party said that Yoon [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=99.12s)]
*  would resign at an unspecified date and until then, they would take over running the government. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=103.08s)]
*  The Defense Ministry seemed to contradict that, saying that Yoon is still commander-in-chief [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=108.62s)]
*  of the military. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=112.64s)]
*  The opposition argues that command of the military must not be left to someone who just [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=114.06s)]
*  tried to stage an insurrection. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=118.26s)]
*  And relieving Yoon of his presidential duties is the only legal option. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=120.38s)]
*  Anthony Kuhn in PR News, Seoul. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=124.7s)]
*  Democratic senators from New Jersey and California will be sworn into the U.S. Congress today. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  They will take over for caretaker appointees before they start their own full six-year [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=132.86s)]
*  Senate terms in January. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=137.58s)]
*  Remember station KQED, Marisa Lagos has more. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=140.08s)]
*  Andy Kim will replace interim New Jersey senator George Helme, who was named to the seat in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=143.66s)]
*  August after former Senator Bob Menendez was convicted on corruption charges and resigned. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  Adam Schiff will take the reins from interim California Senator Lafonza Butler, who was [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=153.58s)]
*  appointed to the seat after Dianne Feinstein's death last year. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=157.9s)]
*  By taking office now, both men will enjoy more seniority than the rest of the freshman [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=161.94s)]
*  class of senators. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Schiff says that could give them a bit more sway in the Senate, even with Democrats in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  the minority. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  That can be pretty helpful, actually, to start early. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=172.98s)]
*  Gives you a head start on committee assignments. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=176.22s)]
*  Both men won special elections to fill out the remainder of this term, as well as a full [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  six-year term starting January 3rd. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=183.04s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Marisa Lagos in San Francisco. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=185.85999999999999s)]
*  President-elect Trump says he will proceed with mass deportations when he takes office [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=189.14s)]
*  next year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=193.22s)]
*  He was interviewed on NBC's Meet the Press. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=194.22s)]
*  Trump says he would begin with convicted criminals but could go beyond that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  Trump also focused on tariffs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=201.32s)]
*  Economists say if Trump imposes large tariffs on goods and services coming into the U.S., [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=202.92s)]
*  this will drive up prices for consumers. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=208.4s)]
*  But Trump said in the interview he couldn't guarantee anything. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman, NPR News. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXeUTmoxxE&t=214.44s)]
