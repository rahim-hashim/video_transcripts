# Disaster Declaration To Speed Repairs To I-95 In Philadelphia | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, June 12. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=0.0s)]
*  Italian media mogul and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi died today at the age of 86, according to the TV network he owns. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  NPR's Silvio Puggioli reports Berlusconi dominated Italian politics for more than two decades, but his political career ended in ignominy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=15.08s)]
*  Berlusconi was Italy's wealthiest person. He owned TV networks, newspapers, publishing houses, a top soccer team, and much more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=24.24s)]
*  When scandals toppled the political establishment in the 1990s, Berlusconi filled the vacuum. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=32.04s)]
*  His new party swept to power, promising Italians prosperity and low taxes. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=37.44s)]
*  He became Italy's longest-serving Prime Minister, but with his permittane, hair transplants and facelifts, he was shunned on the international stage. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=42.36s)]
*  He survived multiple corruption trials and tawdry tales of orgies, but he was forced from power in 2011 by the European debt crisis. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=51.24s)]
*  Three years later, he was ousted from Parliament following his conviction for evading some $10 million in taxes. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Silvio Puggioli, NPR News, Rome. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=66.92s)]
*  President Biden is meeting today at the White House with NATO's outgoing Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=69.8s)]
*  As NPR's Asma Khalid reports, their meeting comes amidst uncertainty over who will become NATO's next leader. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=75.84s)]
*  Stoltenberg is due to step down later this year. He's already extended his term more than once. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=82.8s)]
*  The White House has not publicly said who the United States would support as a successor, but it's praising Stoltenberg for maintaining stability. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=88.88s)]
*  The president remains very grateful and appreciative of the leadership of Jen Stoltenberg as Secretary General. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=96.72s)]
*  John Kirby is a spokesman with the Biden administration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=103.72000000000001s)]
*  He's just done a masterful job, particularly when you look at what the alliance has been able to do, you know, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  laterally, sometimes bilaterally in terms of supporting Ukraine. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  NATO members will meet in Lithuania next month. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=115.64000000000001s)]
*  And a big question is who will lead this transatlantic alliance as Russia's war with Ukraine continues. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=118.4s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine says its forces have retaken a small village from Russian forces. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=127.48s)]
*  It's part of Ukraine's long anticipated counteroffensive operation against the Kremlin. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=132.48s)]
*  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro says he'll issue a disaster declaration today to help speed repairs to an overpass on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=137.28s)]
*  Shapiro says it buckled yesterday after a big fuel truck caught fire underneath the freeway. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=147.2s)]
*  The northbound side of I-95 has completely collapsed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=153.04s)]
*  And the southbound side is not structurally sound to carry any traffic over it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  Officials haven't said what caused the fire, and it's not clear if anyone was hurt. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=163.04s)]
*  The overpass collapse will seriously affect traffic on the East Coast. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=167.76s)]
*  I-95 is a major north-south freeway. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=171.56s)]
*  Shapiro says the section of the overpass that fell carries about 160,000 vehicles daily. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=174.76s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0iws6iXbYE&t=181.67999999999998s)]
