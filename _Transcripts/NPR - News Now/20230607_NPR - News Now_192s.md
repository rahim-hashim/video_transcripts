# Canadian Wildfire Smoke Blankets Much Of The Eastern U.S. | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU)
*  Former Vice President Mike Pence has announced he is running for president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=0.0s)]
*  And Russian shelling continues across southern Ukraine despite widespread flooding after a major dam collapsed yesterday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=4.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=11.0s)]
*  Former Vice President Mike Pence has formally declared that he is running for the Republican presidential nomination. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=16.0s)]
*  He announced the news this morning on a social media video. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=21.0s)]
*  It'd be easy to stay on the sidelines, but that's not how I was raised. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=24.0s)]
*  That's why today, before God and my family, I'm announcing I'm running for president of the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=29.0s)]
*  Pence joins a crowded GOP field. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=36.0s)]
*  North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is expected to announce he is seeking the nomination today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=38.0s)]
*  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie did the same yesterday, and they will all face former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=43.0s)]
*  Nearly a dozen conservative Republicans blocked a pair of GOP bills in the House from advancing yesterday [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=50.0s)]
*  in an effort to send a message to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=56.0s)]
*  NPR's Barbara Sprunt has more. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=60.0s)]
*  The failure to advance a pair of Republican bills that would ramp up gas stove protections was a publicly humiliating blow for McCarthy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=62.0s)]
*  and comes amid intra-party discord around the debt ceiling deal brokered by the Speaker and President Biden. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=70.0s)]
*  Driving the revolt was discontent over the recently passed debt ceiling legislation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=76.0s)]
*  and an accusation by Freedom Caucus member Andrew Clyde of Georgia that GOP leaders had threatened to prevent a bill of his [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=81.0s)]
*  from coming to the floor unless he supported advancing the debt legislation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=88.0s)]
*  House leadership has pushed back on that allegation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=93.0s)]
*  Barbara Sprunt and PR News, The Capitol. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=96.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service has issued several air quality alerts today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=99.0s)]
*  Smoke from wildfires in Canada, including dozens of blazes in Quebec, is flowing south. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=103.0s)]
*  There are alerts up in the northeast, along the mid-Atlantic, and as far south as north and south Carolina. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=109.0s)]
*  There are air quality alerts posted for parts of Ohio, too. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=115.0s)]
*  Russian forces are continuing to shell southern Ukraine, including areas suffering from flooding after a dam was destroyed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=119.0s)]
*  As NPR's Greg Mibrey reports, civilian areas are among the hardest hit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=127.0s)]
*  The Russians fired more than 300 shells into southern Ukraine, including about 30 on the city of Herson. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=131.0s)]
*  According to Ukrainian military officials, the attacks came as large parts of Herson were being inundated Tuesday [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=137.0s)]
*  by rushing waters after a dam was destroyed to the north of the River City. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=144.0s)]
*  The officials said some Russian attacks took place in residential areas and one person was killed and another injured. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=149.0s)]
*  Many homes and streets were flooded, forcing residents to evacuate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=156.0s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia are blaming each other for the collapse of the dam. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=160.0s)]
*  The Russians captured the dam early last year and have controlled it ever since. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=164.0s)]
*  Greg Mibrey, NPR News, Kyiv. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DljsONjcDMU&t=169.0s)]
