# Coast Guard: Submersible Destroyed In 'Catastrophic Implosion' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, June 23rd. I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=0.0s)]
*  The five people aboard a missing submersible in the North Atlantic Ocean are believed dead. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=6.48s)]
*  NPR's Jasmine Garst reports they were descending to view the wreckage of the Titanic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  According to the U.S. Coast Guard, debris from the Titan submersible was found on the ocean floor [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=16.0s)]
*  about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic and that indicates a catastrophic implosion of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=21.04s)]
*  vessel. Rescue teams continue to map the debris field but have indicated that it may be quite [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=27.44s)]
*  difficult to recover the bodies. For years there were widespread concerns about the safety of this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  vessel, among them its ability to withstand deep sea ocean pressure. The ill-fated expedition was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=38.64s)]
*  part of an increasing and very lucrative form of high-risk adventure tourism which remains [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=45.28s)]
*  unregulated. Jasmine Garst, NPR News, New York. President Biden will sign an executive order [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=51.919999999999995s)]
*  today aimed at improving access to contraception and family planning services. As NPR's Tamara [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  Keith reports, this is time to the first anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=64.08s)]
*  overturning Roe v. Wade. This is Biden's third executive order related to reproductive health [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=68.56s)]
*  care since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision caused millions of Americans in conservative [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=74.0s)]
*  states to lose access to abortion services. But this order doesn't address abortion and instead [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=78.56s)]
*  is focused on birth control. Jen Klein leads the White House Gender Policy Council. We're really [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=84.72s)]
*  trying to do three separate things all related to each other in this executive order. The first is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=89.84s)]
*  increase in expanded options, contraceptive options. The second is to lower out-of-pocket costs and the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=95.04s)]
*  third is to raise awareness about what options are available. The order calls for federal agencies to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=101.92s)]
*  consider ways to make those things happen. Tamara Keith, NPR News. India's Prime Minister Narendra [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=107.44s)]
*  Modi continues his high-profile visit to Washington today. He'll have lunch at the State Department [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=113.44s)]
*  welcomed by Vice President Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Modi was the guest of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=118.72s)]
*  honor at a state dinner last night given by President Biden at the White House. Treasury [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=124.08s)]
*  Secretary Janet Yellen is in Paris holding talks about debt relief for developing nations. She's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=129.04s)]
*  also talking about the trade relationship between the U.S. and China. Yellen says dialing back the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=134.56s)]
*  relationship between both nations would not be wise. Trade and investment, open trade and investment, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=140.32s)]
*  I think is a win-win. Both sides gain. But there are areas where we have concerns and as I've made [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=147.28s)]
*  clear and others in the administration have as well, we will certainly take actions, for example, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=156.32s)]
*  to protect our national security. She spoke to NPR's morning edition. Forecasters say it's going [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=163.44s)]
*  to be extremely hot again today in Texas and in parts of the southwest. Temperatures in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=170.16s)]
*  southeastern Arizona could soar well into the triple digits. You're listening to NPR. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvn8MkpYSa4&t=175.92s)]
