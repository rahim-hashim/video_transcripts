*  the region. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=6.08s)]
*  And the Trump administration is putting staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=7.48s)]
*  on leave. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=13.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston from NPR News. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=15.0s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  President Trump says the United States will take over the Gaza Strip and redevelop the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=19.56s)]
*  region. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=25.96s)]
*  The president spoke alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=27.08s)]
*  on Tuesday night. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=34.08s)]
*  other weapons on the site. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=39.32s)]
*  Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=41.64s)]
*  development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=47.36s)]
*  area. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=53.76s)]
*  President Trump said he envisions the world's people living in the Gaza Strip, including [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=59.48s)]
*  At the same time, Trump also suggested that Palestinians who have been displaced by the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=60.92s)]
*  war should be permanently resettled outside of Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  But Egypt, Jordan and other U.S. allies in the Middle East have warned Trump that relocating [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=70.12s)]
*  Palestinians could threaten stability in the region and risk expanding the conflict. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=75.56s)]
*  The U.S. Agency for International Development has announced that it's placing all of its [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=81.76s)]
*  employees on administrative leave. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=86.98s)]
*  NPR's Fatima Tanis reports overseas workers have been ordered to return to the U.S. within [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=89.72s)]
*  30 days. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  I spoke to several officials of the agency who didn't want to be named because they're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  not authorized to speak publicly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=99.68s)]
*  And they said that this is effectively a shutdown of the agency and they call the process inhumane. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=101.92s)]
*  Now for staff who are overseas, there are other concerns. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  People have kids in school, spouses who have jobs, they have pets. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=110.12s)]
*  It's going to be hard to uproot their lives in 30 days. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=113.92s)]
*  And many are expecting the next step to be mass layoffs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  That's NPR's Fatima Tanis reporting. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers are blasting tech billionaire Elon Musk, whose government efficiency team [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=123.32000000000001s)]

*  NPR's Elena Moore reports on how Democrats plan to use their limited power to push back [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=135.68s)]
*  against those efforts. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=141.4s)]

*  Whatever Doge is doing, it's not democracy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=147.44s)]
*  We know what democracy is like. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=150.44s)]
*  It's out in the open. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=152.32s)]
*  It's not secret. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=153.56s)]
*  Democratic senators like Chris Murphy are speaking out. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  I worry that the American public is not going to rise up against this seizure of power if [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=157.76s)]
*  they see Democrats collaborating with Republicans on the floor of the Senate on a regular basis [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=163.8s)]
*  to pass legislation or support nominees. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=169.68s)]
*  Murphy says if Democrats can raise public sentiment, it could move some Republican lawmakers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=172.36s)]
*  to oppose Trump-backed nominees or legislation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=177.4s)]
*  But that has yet to happen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=180.84s)]
*  Elena Moore, NPR News. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=182.24s)]
*  The bird flu outbreak in the United States is further driving up the price of eggs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=184.08s)]
*  Marlin Hyde of Member Station WABE reports restaurants, including the Waffle House chain, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=190.24s)]
*  say they're being forced to charge customers more. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=196.6s)]
*  Waffle House is placing a temporary 50 cent per egg surcharge across its over 2,000 locations [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=200.2s)]

*  According to the Georgia Company, the current bird flu outbreak and egg shortage has driven [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvj8KeBqDQU&t=206.88s)]
