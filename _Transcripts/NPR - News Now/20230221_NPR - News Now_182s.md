# Putin Blames The West For War In Ukraine | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o)
*  Live from NPR News, I'm Koriwa Coleman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden is in Warsaw, joining Polish President Andrzej Duda for a bilateral meeting. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=3.9s)]
*  Afterward, he is expected to deliver a strong speech about Western support for Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=8.8s)]
*  The first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is this Friday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=14.4s)]
*  And NPR's Asma Khalid says Biden wants to make a strong point about Russian motives. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=18.48s)]
*  The White House believes that the world is at a critical moment in this big battle between [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=23.64s)]
*  authoritarianism and democracy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=27.96s)]
*  Biden himself last year in Poland described this as a fight between a rules-based order and brute force. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=29.96s)]
*  And he sees Putin's invasion of Ukraine as part of that broader struggle. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid reporting from Warsaw. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=40.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave his own fiery speech. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=43.96s)]
*  He blamed the West for supporting Ukraine and insisted that the West had started the conflict, not Russia. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=49.46s)]
*  He offered no evidence for his claim. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  Putin also says that Russia will suspend its participation in the last nuclear arms control pact it has with the United States. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  Putin insists he is not fully leaving the nuclear treaty. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=65.86s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is calling for stronger regulations on freight trains that haul hazardous materials. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=70.36s)]
*  That's in response to the fiery derailment of a train hauling toxic chemicals in Ohio earlier this month. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=77.66s)]
*  NPR's David Schaper has more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=84.26s)]
*  Buttigieg wants rail shippers to speed up their phasing in of stronger, more puncture-resistant tank cars for carrying hazardous materials. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=86.56s)]
*  And he wants Congress to untie the agency's hands and raise the limit on the amount the DOT can fine railroads for safety violations. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=94.26s)]
*  As for Republicans who have criticized his response to the derailment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=102.06s)]
*  I will say I can't help but notice that some of the people who hasten to be on TV talking about this have sided with industry [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=105.66s)]
*  when industry was trying to block or weaken rail safety standards. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=113.86s)]
*  Buttigieg says he will visit the site of the rail disaster in East Palestine, Ohio, but no date has yet been set. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=117.76s)]
*  David Schaper, NPR News. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  Jurors in the federal seditious conspiracy trial in Washington, D.C. against leaders of the Proud Boys will hear from a star witness this week. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=126.26s)]
*  NPR's Gary Johnson has more about a member of the far-right group who pleaded guilty and agreed to help federal prosecutors. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=135.66s)]
*  Jeremy Bertino didn't appear at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, but prosecutors say he took part in a chat group [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=143.56s)]
*  where Proud Boys discussed storming the building and told them not to go home or back down. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=151.06s)]
*  Bertino was stabbed and suffered serious injuries in a street fight in Washington before the attempt to delay certification of the 2020 election. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=156.26s)]
*  He later pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in a weapons charge. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=164.36s)]
*  Bertino is one of three Proud Boys insiders expected to testify in the case against Chairman Enrique Tarrio and four others. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6gu5s0yq-o&t=168.46s)]
