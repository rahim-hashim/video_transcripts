# U.S. Health Agencies Ordered To Halt Public Communications | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8)
*  One of the men charged in the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and freed by President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=0.0s)]
*  has been re-arrested on gun charges and federal health agencies have been directed to halt all [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=5.2s)]
*  communications with the public. Good afternoon. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=10.88s)]
*  top stories. President Trump is continuing to defend his pardon of all the people charged [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=16.48s)]
*  and convicted in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. He pardoned about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=21.12s)]
*  1,500 people. Now, NPR's Tom Driesbach reports one of the men Trump freed has been re-arrested on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=26.4s)]
*  gun charges. During the January 6th attack on the Capitol, Daniel Ball allegedly threw an explosive [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=32.72s)]
*  device which ricocheted off a police officer's helmet and exploded, causing multiple injuries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=38.56s)]
*  Later, he allegedly threw a piece of wood at police officers protecting the Capitol. His case was [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=44.0s)]
*  pending when Trump ordered Ball freed as part of his blanket clemency for January 6th defendants. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=49.2s)]
*  But then Ball was re-arrested on unrelated charges. Federal prosecutors in Florida say [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=55.04s)]
*  he illegally possessed a gun even though he had a criminal record for multiple felonies, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=61.28s)]
*  including domestic violence battery by strangulation and resisting law enforcement by violence. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=66.24s)]
*  Tom Driesbach, NPR News. The Trump administration is suspending all refugee admissions to the United [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=71.84s)]
*  States. That includes Afghans who helped the U.S. during America's longest war. NPR's Michelle [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=77.92s)]
*  Kellerman reports. The State Department has told agencies that help resettle refugees that all [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=83.6s)]
*  arrivals have been suspended and previously planned travel should be canceled. The move [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  leaves thousands of refugees already cleared to move to the U.S. in limbo. The ranking Democrat [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=94.24s)]
*  on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jean Shaheen, is urging the Trump administration to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=100.24s)]
*  reconsider. She's expressed alarm that more than 1,600 Afghans who were cleared to resettle in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  U.S. have had their flights canceled. She says the U.S. should not turn its back on them or on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=111.12s)]
*  others in need, including refugees fleeing violence in Sudan and Burma. Michelle Kellerman, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=116.64s)]
*  NPR News, the State Department. The House has voted to pass the Lake and Riley Act. NPR's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Jimena Bastille reports this sends the measure to President Trump for his signature. The measure [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  would make it easier for federal immigration officials to detain and deport those without [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=132.4s)]
*  legal status who are charged with crimes ranging from minor burglary offenses to more serious [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=136.4s)]
*  crimes involving bodily harm, death, or harm to law enforcement officers. The measure passed with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=141.28s)]
*  the support of 46 Democrats. The vote marked a major shift for many in the party. Democrats broadly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=147.28s)]
*  rejected the measure at various times last year, but the politics of the bill shifted after the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=152.72s)]
*  election. Twelve Democrats supported the bill when it passed the Senate earlier this week. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=157.28s)]
*  Trump could sign the bill as early as this week. Jimena Bastille, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=162.0s)]
*  Trump administration officials say they're already rounding up more migrants accused of violent [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=166.96s)]
*  crimes. It's part of their effort to crack down on people without legal status in the United States. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=171.92s)]
*  But NPR's Brian Mann reports so far the number of arrests appears only slightly higher than under [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=177.6s)]
*  the Biden administration. Trump officials say they've arrested roughly 400 migrants with criminal [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=184.0s)]
*  records. Speaking on Fox News, White House adviser Stephen Miller said initial immigration [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=188.88s)]
*  operations have already arrested and removed what he called some of the most vicious criminals in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=193.76s)]
*  this country. But former acting director of U.S. immigration and customs John Sandwig told NPR, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=198.88s)]
*  enforcement actions carried out so far aren't a significant increase. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=204.72s)]
*  I think these operations, this initial surge is business as usual. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=208.32s)]
*  NPR found migrant arrests varied over time during the Biden administration, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=211.76s)]
*  but federal agents were already arresting more than 100 migrants per day with criminal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=216.4s)]
*  convictions or charges pending before Trump took office. Brian Mann, NPR News, New York. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=220.88s)]
*  The Trump administration has told all federal health agencies to immediately stop all public [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  communications. That's until they can all be reviewed by a Trump appointee. The National [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=230.8s)]
*  Institutes of Health has now canceled key meetings. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin says scientists, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=236.08s)]
*  such as cancer researchers, say they've been told almost nothing about the cancellations. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=242.24s)]
*  These are not the kinds of meetings that can easily be rescheduled. There are a lot of moving parts, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=247.52s)]
*  different institutions, different timetables, and a delay, especially an indefinite delay like this [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=252.16s)]
*  one, could really have a negative impact on important cancer research. The full scope of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=257.68s)]
*  these cancellations isn't clear at this point, but a lot of scientists are concerned that biomedical [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=262.56s)]
*  research of all kinds could be disrupted. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reporting. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=266.88s)]
*  President Trump is threatening to impose high levels of tariffs and sanctions on Russia if [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=271.28s)]
*  there's no deal to end the war in Ukraine. NPR's Franco Ortonius has more. During his campaign, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=275.84s)]
*  Trump repeatedly said he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day if he was [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=281.84s)]
*  elected president. Speaking to reporters this week, Trump said the Ukrainians want to make a deal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=286.88s)]
*  President Zelensky would like to have peace. He's told me that very strongly. He'd like to have [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=292.08s)]
*  peace, but it takes two to tango. We'll see what happens. In his social media post, Trump [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=297.04s)]
*  emphasizes that he's not looking to hurt Russia and that he's actually doing Putin a very big favor, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=301.6s)]
*  considering the number of Russian lives lost and the impact on the economy. In Trump's words, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=307.36s)]
*  it's time to end the ridiculous war, adding, quote, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=312.72s)]
*  And the easy way is always better. Franco Ortonius, NPR News, The White House. Same-sex couples across [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHNfHAjyB8&t=319.20000000000005s)]
