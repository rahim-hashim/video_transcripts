# 14-Year-Old Arrested After 9 Killed In Serbian School Shooting | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA)
*  Policymakers at the Federal Reserve are expected to announce another interest rate hike this afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Biden administration is preparing for another surge of migrants at the southern U.S. border. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=11.4s)]
*  After four days of searching, officials in Texas have arrested a man wanted in connection with the killings of five of his neighbors. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=16.0s)]
*  From Houston Public Media, Jack Williams reports, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Francisco Oropeza was picked up in a small town a few miles from where Friday night's shootings happen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=25.8s)]
*  Authorities say Oropeza was found under a pile of laundry in a closet in the small town of Cutton Shute about 40 miles north of Houston. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=31.6s)]
*  He was arrested without incident and is charged with five counts of murder in the shooting deaths of his neighbors, including a young boy. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=39.6s)]
*  This is the FBI's Jimmy Paul. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=47.7s)]
*  The tip for the suspect's location came in through the FBI's tip line. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=50.2s)]
*  And we just want to thank the person who had the courage and bravery to call in the suspect's location. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=54.4s)]
*  More than 200 law enforcement officers had searched the area for nearly four days with few clues. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=61.1s)]
*  Oropeza was arrested about 15 miles from where the shootings occurred. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=67.6s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Jack Williams in Houston. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=71.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, local Texas law enforcement officials held another news conference last hour. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=74.5s)]
*  They say they've arrested more people in the shooting case but would not offer details. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=79.3s)]
*  Officials in Serbia say eight children and a school security guard have been killed in a mass shooting today in the capital Belgrade. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=84.2s)]
*  Officials say the suspected gunman is a seventh grade boy who had his father's handgun. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=91.2s)]
*  The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again this afternoon as part of its ongoing effort to curb inflation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=97.3s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reports, forecasters saying this could be the Fed's last rate hike for a while. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  The Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates nine times in just over a year, the most aggressive pace of rate hikes since the 1980s. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=110.5s)]
*  With a resulting slowdown in economic growth and some signs of cooling in the job market, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=117.5s)]
*  many forecasters think the Fed will raise rates once more this afternoon, then take a breather and let higher borrowing costs do their work. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=122.5s)]
*  Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money for a business, get a car loan or carry a balance on your credit card. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=130.0s)]
*  According to the Fed's preferred yardstick, annual inflation was 4.2% in March. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  That's down from a four-decade high last summer, but it's still more than double the Fed's target inflation rate of 2%. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=142.2s)]
*  Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  The Biden administration is preparing for a surge of migrants at the southern U.S. border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=150.6s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder reports on the decision to send 1,500 U.S. troops to the border. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  Pentagon spokesman, Brigadier General Pat Ryder says the 1,500 troops are being sent at the request of the Homeland Security Department [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=162.1s)]
*  and will begin arriving at the southern border next week, potentially the day before Trump-era COVID-19 restrictions expire on May 11. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=169.4s)]
*  Ryder says the deployment is for 90 days and that the troops are to take on administrative duties [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=177.5s)]
*  to free border patrol agents to perform their law enforcement responsibilities. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=183.3s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder reporting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhZbMZKNSA&t=187.1s)]
