# Special Counsel: Evidence Would Have Convicted Trump | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc)
*  Live from NPR News in Washington, on Korova Coleman, the Justice Department has published [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=0.0s)]
*  one part of the report from Special Counsel Jack Smith. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  NPR's Carrie Johnson tells us Smith investigated allegations of election interference by President [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=7.68s)]
* -elect Trump. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=12.76s)]
*  The report concludes there was enough evidence for a jury in Washington, D.C. to convict [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=13.76s)]
*  Trump for trying to cling to power after he lost the 2020 election. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=17.92s)]
*  Prosecutors say Trump engaged in a campaign of pervasive deceit about those election results [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=22.6s)]
*  and that he stood at the center of a criminal conspiracy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  Jack Smith says the rule of law matters and so does setting an example to pursue justice [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=30.88s)]
*  in the face of personal attacks and threats. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=36.48s)]
*  But he walked away from the election interference case because long-standing Justice Department [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=38.92s)]
*  policy prohibits prosecuting a sitting president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Trump will be sworn in for his second term next Monday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  In a social media post, Trump called Smith names and said the voters in 2024 had spoken, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=50.72s)]
*  returning him to the White House. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=56.16s)]
*  Carrie Johnson, NPR News, Washington. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=58.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, a federal judge has temporarily blocked a second volume of Jack Smith's report [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=60.36s)]
*  that covers the special prosecutor's case against Trump that alleged mishandling of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=65.24s)]
*  classified documents and obstructing justice as officers tried to retrieve them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=69.72s)]
*  Confirmation hearings opened this week for several of President-elect Trump's cabinet [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=75.8s)]
*  nominees. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  They begin today with the Senate Armed Services Committee and Defense Secretary nominee Pete [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=80.8s)]
*  NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports the hearings will be tests for the appointees and for Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=86.4s)]
*  Senators in general believe presidents should be able to pick their own teams, but as part [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  of the Senate's advise and consent role, nominees are required to take questions about [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=95.72s)]
*  their qualifications and plans for how they would run these important agencies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=100.0s)]
*  Many Americans are likely unfamiliar with the nominees, so this will be the first time [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  many will be hearing from them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=107.72s)]
*  It amounts to a test of the nominees' ability to show they can handle scrutiny, and it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  also a test of Trump's political capital as he navigates very narrow majorities in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=113.92s)]
*  both the House and the Senate. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Domenico Montanaro, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=120.04s)]
*  Forecasters say powerful winds are returning to the Los Angeles area today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=122.88s)]
*  Fire crews say they're prepared to fight any flare-ups or new blazes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=127.44s)]
*  The biggest fire, the Palisades Fire West of Los Angeles, is only 14 percent contained. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=131.96s)]
*  President Biden says the nation needs to help Los Angeles recover from the firestorm. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=138.0s)]
*  It's going to cost tens of billions of dollars to get Los Angeles back to where it was. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=143.12s)]
*  So we're going to need Congress to step up to provide funding to get this done. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  But House Speaker Mike Johnson says stipulations should be set on that funding to L.A. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=154.4s)]
*  I think there should probably be conditions on that, Abe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  That's my personal view. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=163.08s)]
*  We'll see what the consensus is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=164.08s)]
*  I haven't had a chance to socialize that with any of the members over the weekend because [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=165.08s)]
*  we've all been very busy, but it'll be part of the discussion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=169.08s)]
*  The Speaker did not offer specifics on what those conditions on the aid might be. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=172.4s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfx1mbc3gMc&t=177.96s)]
