**NPR - News Now:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, February 14th. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=0.0s)]
*  and here are today's top stories. Vice President Vance is set to meet Ukrainian [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=4.96s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelensky today on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaram reports the U.S. is taking a more active role in efforts to bring an end to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=13.92s)]
*  the Russia-Ukraine war. Vance is also set to deliver remarks at the annual conference [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=19.2s)]
*  where the Russia-Ukraine war has been a central focus since it started nearly three years ago. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=24.48s)]
*  On Wednesday, President Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=29.44s)]
*  and said the two would meet face-to-face in Saudi Arabia soon. Trump afterward also spoke with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=33.92s)]
*  Zelensky over the phone. Vance spoke at the Munich Security Conference last year as well and said it [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  was time for the U.S. to pivot away from its focus on Europe and turn to China and East Asia as the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=44.56s)]
*  future of U.S. foreign policy. Deepa Sivaram, NPR News. President Trump has announced reciprocal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=49.92s)]
*  tariffs against countries around the world and Piers Daniel Kurtz-Levin explains. Trump described [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=55.76s)]
*  what he means by reciprocal tariffs. On trade I have decided for purposes of fairness that I will [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=61.92s)]
*  charge a reciprocal tariff meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=68.0s)]
*  we will charge them no more no less. The administration said they will determine [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=74.0s)]
*  what each country's tariff level should be. Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick said [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=78.72s)]

*  import goods. Trump acknowledged that the tariffs could lead to higher prices but said he hopes they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=88.0s)]
*  will create jobs. Earlier this week Trump signed a separate order for 25 percent tariffs on steel [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=92.96000000000001s)]

*  at the National Nuclear Security Administration were expected to lose their jobs according to a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  source within the agency who was not authorized to speak to the press. Those jobs include overseeing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=121.03999999999999s)]

*  Determinations affect employees that have only been with the agency for a year or two. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=137.68s)]
*  Many other agencies including the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=142.4s)]
*  are reporting similar firings. Jeff Brumfield, NPR News, Washington. New York Governor Kathy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=148.32s)]

*  charged the doctor with prescribing abortion pills online to a Louisiana resident. Louisiana's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Governor Jeff Landry says the doctor needs to face trial so justice will be served. Governor Hochul [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=166.72s)]
*  replied on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show. We have a doctor who's trying to help someone, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=172.96s)]
*  another state who's benighted the right of control over her own body, just doing what her oath [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=178.64s)]
*  requires her to do, and now she's treated like a criminal. It was not a tough decision for me, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=183.84s)]
*  Rachel. I said no and hell no. I will never ever send this person to harm's way to stand for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=188.72s)]
*  15 years of possible jail time for just being a doctor. This case could be the first to test [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=195.2s)]
*  New York State's SHIELD law. It protects providers who prescribe abortion medication to patients in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=201.28s)]
*  states where abortion is outlawed. Hamas has named the three hostages it will release tomorrow as [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=207.28s)]
*  originally called for in the ceasefire agreement with Israel. The hostages include an American and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=213.92s)]

*  him into its mouth. Then it went under. The whole thing was filmed by Simancas's father, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBynor5GmUs&t=244.88s)]
