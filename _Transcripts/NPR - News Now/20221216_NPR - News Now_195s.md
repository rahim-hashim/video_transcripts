# Biden Braces for Immigration Surge, House Debates Gun Control | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano)
*  Russia launched a fresh wave of missiles at Ukraine overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Biden administration is bracing for the end of a pandemic-era immigration policy [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=3.68s)]
*  and its effects at the southern U.S. border. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=8.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=11.36s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=12.36s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Russia has launched a fresh barrage of missile strikes against Ukrainian targets this morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=17.12s)]
*  These took out power in cities across Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=21.76s)]
*  NPR's Tim Mack reports from Kyiv it's making conditions even more difficult as cold, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=24.48s)]
*  wintry weather continues. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=29.6s)]
*  Ukrainian officials announced that Russia launched at least 70 strikes targeting some [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=31.44s)]
*  10 Ukrainian regions. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaly Klitschko, said that at least three strikes had occurred in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=37.84s)]
*  the capital city. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=42.44s)]
*  And the southern city of Krivyi Rih was struck at least 12 times, according to the local [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=43.92s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=48.52s)]
*  Power and water supplies are threatened because of the attacks, Ukrainian officials warned. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=49.52s)]
*  For example, Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, was without power as temperatures [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=54.2s)]
*  hovered around freezing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=59.14s)]
*  The mayor of that city announced that public shelters with heat, power, and internet were [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=61.06s)]
*  operating as planned. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  Tim Mack, NPR News, Kyiv. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=67.26s)]
*  President Biden is bracing for the arrival of tens of thousands of new migrants at the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=69.98s)]
*  southern U.S. border. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=74.1s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordoñez reports on the administration's preparation for the end of the federal policy [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=75.66s)]
*  affecting immigration, known as Title 42. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=81.1s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security put out a six-point plan describing how it is surging [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=84.78s)]
*  resources at the border in preparation for the end of the pandemic-era authority that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=89.22s)]
*  allows officials to turn away migrants seeking asylum at the border. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=94.02s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says the administration is also doubling down [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=98.26s)]
*  on operations to combat human smuggling. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=102.58s)]
*  We'll continue to drive messaging in the region to counter disinformation from smugglers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=105.34s)]
*  So that's another thing that we have to keep an eye on is how the misinformation that's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  going to be going out to smugglers in the next couple of days. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=114.16s)]
*  Politically, Biden is also looking to fend off Republicans who have been attacking him [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=117.44s)]
*  over his administration's handling of the border. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=121.6s)]
*  Franco Ordoñez, NPR News, The White House. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  Congress has passed a short-term spending bill that keeps the government funded for [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=127.72s)]
*  another week. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=131.76s)]
*  This will give congressional negotiators time to wrap up talks on a year-long spending bill. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=133.14s)]
*  A House committee has taken up the issue of whether to ban assault weapons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=139.32s)]
*  Several witnesses addressed the panel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  That included Faith Mata. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  She lost her younger sister Tess Mata in the mass shooting earlier this year at the elementary [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=147.72s)]
*  school in Uvalde, Texas. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=152.72s)]
*  I truly hope that this never happens to any other family in the days, months or years [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=154.88s)]
*  to come. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  This debatable topic on assault rifles should not be brought up again because someone else's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  child or sibling was murdered. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  It's just an excuse at this point. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=168.44s)]
*  Other lawmakers disagreed, saying that banning guns is only an attack on the Second Amendment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=170.4s)]
*  The House January 6th committee will meet on Monday. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=177.32s)]
*  Lawmakers hope to share information from their final report. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=180.72s)]
*  The chair of the committee has said the committee is likely to make criminal referrals to the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  Justice Department for prosecution. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=188.24s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebpXqh2Eano&t=191.56s)]
