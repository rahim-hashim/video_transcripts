# Extent Of Damage From U.S. Strikes In Iran Still Being Assessed | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg)
*  President Trump and Pentagon officials are claiming success after the U.S. launched strikes on Iran over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=0.0s)]
*  And people at a church in southern Michigan were able to avert a mass shooting yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=6.32s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=11.52s)]
*  Top members of President Trump's cabinet say the U.S. strikes this weekend on three Iranian nuclear sites were just that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=16.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others say the attacks were not intended for a change in Iran's regime. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  But writing online yesterday, President Trump said if Iran's leaders cannot make their country great again, quote, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=28.32s)]
*  why wouldn't there be a regime change? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=34.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump and the Pentagon say the three U.S. strikes were a major success, as NPR's Greg Myrie reports. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=36.64s)]
*  The U.S. used B-2 stealth bombers to drop 30,000 pound bunker busting bombs on two Iranian nuclear sites, Fordow and Natanz. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=42.96s)]
*  A submarine fired Tomahawk missiles at a third nuclear site in Isfahan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=52.08s)]
*  The U.S. planes flew round trip from an air base near Kansas City. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=57.2s)]
*  President Trump said the attacks totally obliterated the Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Cain, offered a slightly different take, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=66.48s)]
*  saying the strikes caused severe damage and destruction. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=71.76s)]
*  But he said it was too soon to know whether Iran had lost all of its nuclear capability. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=75.28s)]
*  Iran has fired additional missiles at Israel, but has not acted against any U.S. targets. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=80.48s)]
*  Greg Myrie, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=86.32s)]
*  The State Department says it has organized two evacuation flights out of Israel carrying 70 Americans and green card holders. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  There are hundreds of thousands of Americans living in Israel. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports many are now asking about their options to leave. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=100.8s)]
*  On the same day that the U.S. dropped massive bombs on Iranian nuclear sites joining Israel's war there, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=106.0s)]
*  the U.S. ambassador to Israel took to social media to encourage American citizens to sign up for information about evacuation flights. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=112.16s)]
*  Ambassador Mike Huckabee wrote that his team is working around the clock to assist American citizens. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  He encouraged them to fill out a form on travel.state.gov. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=126.32s)]
*  The State Department says so far it has provided information to 27,000 people [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=130.32s)]
*  and a few thousand of them have said they're interested in leaving Israel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, the State Department. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=139.52s)]
*  Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil is now free on bail. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=143.12s)]
*  He spent more than three months in detention. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=147.52s)]
*  Khalil was detained as the first of several students who had peacefully protested against the war in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=150.08s)]
*  Khalil says he was taken by men wearing masks. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  It felt like kidnapping, to be honest. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=159.28s)]
*  You have plain clothes agents in unmarked cars not identifying themselves, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=162.0s)]
*  claiming to have an arrest warrant that they did not show. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=168.96s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's morning edition. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security says his detention was legal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  Khalil is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. The DHS is urging him to self-deport. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=178.88s)]
*  A federal judge in Nashville has ruled that migrant Kilma Abrego Garcia, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=185.04s)]
*  who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, can be released on bail. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=189.68s)]
*  From member station WPLN in Nashville, Mariana Bacquiao reports he may not go free. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=194.56s)]
*  The judge has ordered that Abrego Garcia be released as he awaits trial on human smuggling charges. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=201.36s)]
*  But the 29-year-old who was wrongly deported from Maryland to El Salvador in March [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  may go into ICE custody instead, officials say. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=213.12s)]
*  In her ruling, the judge writes that the government failed to prove that Abrego Garcia was a flight risk. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=217.2s)]
*  Prosecutors say that Abrego Garcia smuggled people without legal status for the MS-13 gang. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=222.96s)]
*  The defense says that the charges are to distract from the lack of due process in Abrego Garcia's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=228.72s)]
*  case. The conditions of his release will be discussed at a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Mariana Bacquiao in Nashville. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=240.24s)]
*  Authorities in southern Michigan say that people at a church were able to avert a mass shooting [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=244.56s)]
*  yesterday. A man driving recklessly got out of his car and then opened fire toward the church in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=250.4s)]
*  Wayne, Michigan. He hit one person in the leg. A church goer then struck the man with his car. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=256.88s)]
*  After that, at least two staff members at the church opened fire. They killed the armed man. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=263.6s)]
*  No one else was injured in the incident. Police in Michigan say the man's motive is not clear. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  A federal judge in San Antonio has ruled that the state of Texas has been illegally placing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=275.84s)]
*  people with severe disabilities in nursing homes. Texas Public Radio's Dan Kass reports the judge [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=280.96s)]
*  gave the state of Texas and the plaintiffs until August 1st to propose a fix to the violations. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia found that the state of Texas for decades unnecessarily [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=292.88s)]
*  institutionalized 4,500 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in nursing homes, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  denying them appropriate services that are required under federal law. Garcia called the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=303.92s)]
*  problem severe and ongoing, dating back to a statute Congress passed in 1987 that requires [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=308.56s)]
*  screening to identify community programs instead of automatically institutionalizing people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  And while they're there, we're not getting even minimally adequate levels of services [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=319.44s)]
*  that is required by federal law. That's Stephen Schwartz, special counsel at the Center for Public [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=325.04s)]
*  Representation. He filed a class action lawsuit 15 years ago and called the ruling a landmark [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=329.36s)]
*  decision. I'm Dan Katz in San Antonio. The National Weather Service says the first significant heat [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=334.88s)]
*  wave is rippling over parts of the central and eastern U.S. this morning. There are heat [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=341.12s)]
*  advisories posted from eastern Texas to New England. National Weather Service meteorologist [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  Brian Hurley says it will be 15 to 20 degrees hotter than usual. Very unusual in June to have [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=351.68s)]
*  temperatures certainly greater than 95 or even even 100 degrees or greater, 101, 102. And it's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=359.2s)]
*  not just that, it's also the overnight lows. Heat values will be above 100 degrees in St. Louis, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=368.0s)]
*  northern Indiana, and even Boston today. This heat is expected to last through the weekend. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=373.52s)]
*  It will persist in some areas well into next week. The Oklahoma City Thunder claimed its first NBA [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=379.36s)]
*  championship last night in a game seven victory. From member station KOSU, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=386.32s)]
*  Abigail Sikowski was on the ground for the celebration. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the sound of Oklahoma City Thunder fans celebrating their squad's first championship. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=398.0s)]
*  Sip Alvarez was among the crowd at a local bar for the game. He says he never expected to experience [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=404.08s)]
*  a victory like this. We're breaking through the boundaries of what people would call a small city. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=410.32s)]
*  And we're ready. Very proud to be an Oklahoman. Very proud they entrusted us with a team and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=416.32s)]
*  that we've come this far. Alvarez works as a painting contractor in OKC, but he says he's [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=423.12s)]
*  not expecting his employees to come into work today as they celebrate the victory. As Oklahoma [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=429.76s)]
*  City's only Big Four sports franchise, this is the city's first ever major championship in a [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=435.2s)]
*  professional sport. For NPR News, I'm Abigail Sikowski in Oklahoma City. I'm Korva Coleman, NPR News. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV09yp6ypqg&t=440.4s)]
