# Federal Trade Court Blocks Trump's Sweeping Tariffs | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE)
*  A federal court has blocked President Trump's tariffs on imports from nearly every other [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=0.0s)]
*  country, and Trump says he's considering pardons for the men convicted of conspiring to kidnap [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=5.32s)]
*  the governor of Michigan. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=10.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  A federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=16.4s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reports the U.S. Court of International Trade says Trump overstepped [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=19.6s)]
*  his authority by taxing imports from nearly every other country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=24.52s)]
*  In a unanimous ruling, the three-judge panel said the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=28.84s)]
*  power to regulate trade and impose tariffs. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=34.12s)]
*  The court says the 1977 emergency law Trump relied on in ordering tariffs does not give [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=37.26s)]
*  the president unbounded power to tax imports from nearly every other country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=42.38s)]
*  If that ruling stands, it would strike down all the tariffs that Trump ordered on April [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=47.06s)]
*  2, as well as separate taxes on imports from China, Canada and Mexico, some of which have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=51.36s)]
*  been temporarily suspended. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=56.08s)]
*  The tariffs were challenged by a dozen states and five businesses. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=58.14s)]
*  The three judges who ruled against the president were appointed by Presidents Reagan, Obama [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  and Trump himself. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=66.34s)]
*  Scott Horsley, NPR News. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=67.94s)]
*  President Trump says he's considering pardons for the men convicted of conspiring to kidnap [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=69.98s)]
*  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=74.28s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordonius reports Trump said he had watched the men's trial. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=76.54s)]
*  President Trump said the case against the two men appears to be somewhat of a, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=81.22s)]
*  railroad job. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=85.74s)]
*  It looked to me like some people said some stupid things, you know? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=86.74s)]
*  They were drinking and I think they said stupid things, but I'll take a look at that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Barry Croft Jr. was sentenced to nearly 20 years, while Adam Fox was sentenced to 16 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=93.94s)]
*  years after being convicted of leading a violent scheme to kidnap Governor Whitmer during the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=99.78s)]
*  final stretch of the 2020 presidential election. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  Defense lawyers have claimed the men were victims of entrapment and that government [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=108.86s)]
*  informants egged them on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=112.5s)]
*  But last month, a federal appeals court upheld their convictions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=114.34s)]
*  Franco Ordonius, NPR News, The White House. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=118.46s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the U.S. will aggressively revoke visas from many Chinese [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  students. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=127.54s)]
*  And here's Emily Fang reports. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=128.54s)]
*  The State Department said in a cable this week it was pausing interview signups for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=130.38s)]
*  new student visa applicants in order to adequately screen their social media profiles. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=133.66s)]
*  Now Rubio says the U.S. will enhance visa application scrutiny for students coming from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=139.22s)]
*  China and Hong Kong and terminate the visas for students with quote connections to China's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=143.94s)]
*  ruling Communist Party and those who study in what he called critical fields. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=150.18s)]
*  Depending on how broadly the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security define [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=155.5s)]
*  those criteria, this could affect many of the some 280,000 Chinese students at all levels [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=159.74s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=166.1s)]
*  China is the second biggest source of international students in the U.S. having recently been [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=167.58s)]
*  eclipsed by India. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=171.58s)]
*  Emily Fang, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=173.66000000000003s)]
*  A judge has ruled Secretary of State Rubio likely violated the Constitution. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=176.34s)]
*  That's after he stripped Mahmoud Khalil's green card and ordered him deported over pro-Palestinian [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=181.06s)]
*  activism at Columbia University. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=186.06s)]
*  And fears Adrian Florido reports the judge stopped short of ordering Khalil freed from [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=188.78s)]
*  custody. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=193.34s)]
*  Judge Michael Farber said in his ruling that Rubio likely overstepped when he relied on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=194.34s)]
*  an obscure statute that allows him to personally order someone deported who he thinks threatens [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=198.9s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy goals. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=204.38s)]
*  Rubio claimed, without offering evidence, that Khalil's protests were anti-Semitic and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=206.22s)]
*  therefore undermined what Rubio said are the government's efforts to fight anti-Semitism [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=210.7s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  The judge said using that authority to go after Khalil for his protests would probably [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=216.46s)]
*  be proven unconstitutional at trial. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=221.02s)]
*  His lawyers hoped the judge would free Khalil from immigration detention as the case moves [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=223.78s)]
*  forward but the judge said his legal team needs to submit more evidence to show how [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=227.78s)]
*  Khalil is being harmed by his detention. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=231.98s)]
*  Adrian Florido, NPR News. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  The Department of Health and Human Services has canceled the only federal contract to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=236.58s)]
*  develop a vaccine to protect people against the bird flu virus. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=240.66s)]
*  NPR's Rob Stein has more. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=245.54s)]
*  Federal officials are canceling a contract with Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=247.98s)]
*  protect people against flu strains that could cause pandemics. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=252.54s)]
*  That includes the H5N1 bird flu virus that's been spreading among dairy cows in the U.S. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=256.34s)]
*  The cancellation comes even though the company says a study involving 300 healthy adults [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  has produced positive results. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  An HHS spokesman says the contract was canceled because of concerns about the safety of mRNA [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=269.5s)]
*  vaccines. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=276.26s)]

*  The Federal Association of the Deaf is suing the White House. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=280.5s)]
*  The organization says the use of American Sign Language interpreters abruptly stopped [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  during press briefings when President Trump returned to office. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=288.34s)]
*  NPR's Kristen Wright reports that's despite the organization's repeated requests. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=292.02s)]
*  The federal lawsuit is filed on behalf of two deaf men who watched televised White House [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=296.78s)]
*  press briefings and have trouble understanding closed captioning, which can be unreliable. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=301.26s)]
*  The suit says the men and others in the deaf community are missing a litany of vital information [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=306.54s)]
*  on the economy, social security and DEI, among other issues affecting Americans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=311.5s)]
*  ASL is the primary language for many deaf people. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=317.06s)]
*  Joy Banister contracts ASL interpreters to the federal government. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=320.66s)]
*  It's really at the detriment to our deaf community. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=324.9s)]
*  So we want to make sure that they are able still to be a part of the community and have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=327.46s)]
*  the accesses that they need. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=333.06s)]

*  groups not to take part in the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=366.54s)]
*  It's a shakedown by UN mobsters. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=369.86s)]
*  How can they do that? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=373.66s)]

*  Five years ago, Broadway theaters were shuttered and after an 18-month pause from COVID-19, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=436.97999999999996s)]

*  But this past season, Broadway posted its highest box office numbers to date, even if [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=447.17999999999995s)]
*  attendance was slightly behind the last season before the pandemic. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=452.7s)]
*  Part of this trend is the box office bonanza of a few high-profile productions of plays [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIGVPJZo5uE&t=457.85999999999996s)]
