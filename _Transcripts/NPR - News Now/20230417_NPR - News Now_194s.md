# 4 Killed, Dozens Injured In Alabama Shooting | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg)
*  Four people were killed at a shooting at a birthday party in Alabama on Saturday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=0.0s)]
*  And the death toll continues to rise in Sudan, where the country's military is fighting members [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=5.0s)]
*  of a paramilitary group. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=9.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=11.44s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=12.44s)]
*  Authorities in the town of Dadeville, Alabama, say four people were killed in a shooting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=16.88s)]
*  at a birthday party Saturday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=20.2s)]
*  Law enforcement officials say 28 more people were injured. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=22.12s)]
*  But they won't say if they know who the suspect is or if they died in the shooting or whether [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=25.52s)]
*  that person is still at large in the community. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=29.98s)]
*  For Troy Public Radio, Kyle Gassett says that lack of information is upsetting residents. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=33.02s)]
*  They're frustrated and don't understand why the police are being so tight lipped. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=38.3s)]
*  As you know, in other mass shootings by this point, a day or two after the event, there's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=42.1s)]
*  typically a good idea about the circumstances and some clues about what happened and why. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  And in this case, we really have none of that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=51.06s)]
*  Kyle Gassett reporting. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=53.18s)]
*  In Kansas City, Missouri, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the home of a man who should [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=55.1s)]
*  have been shot and seriously wounded a black teenager. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=59.9s)]
*  The boy had accidentally rung his doorbell because he had gone to the wrong address by [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=63.26s)]
*  mistake. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=68.22s)]
*  From member station KCUR, Savannah Hawley-Bates reports the boy is now in a medically induced [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  coma. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=74.62s)]
*  The homeowner shot 16-year-old Ralph Yarrow twice in the head through a glass door. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=75.62s)]
*  The shooter was taken into custody but released after a 24-hour hold and is not currently [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  facing charges. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=84.74s)]
*  More than 300 people gathered outside the shooter's home Sunday demanding he face prosecution [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=86.5s)]
*  and possible hate crime charges. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=91.13999999999999s)]
*  Justice Gatson of Real Justice Network spoke at the protest. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  My son delivers food every morning and some of y'all do too. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  And sometimes you go to a wrong address. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=101.86s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=104.38s)]
*  And you should never, ever have to worry that your life will be taken. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=106.38s)]

*  allowed to go home. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=125.28s)]

*  There have been growing calls for a ceasefire in the fighting. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=165.78s)]
*  Neighboring Egypt has offered to mediate between both sides while the regional cooperation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0Oi1Y2vxg&t=168.66s)]
