# At Least 10 Dead As LA Fires Continue To Rage | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A)
*  At least 10 people have been killed and more than 10,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed in the Los Angeles area firestorm. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=0.0s)]
*  And TikTok will plead its case today to the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=7.92s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=11.6s)]
*  The firestorm in the Los Angeles region continues to rage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=16.0s)]
*  The L.A. County Medical Examiner says at least 10 people have been killed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=19.76s)]
*  The largest blaze is the Palisades Fire northwest of the city. It's about 6% contained. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=23.44s)]
*  Another huge blaze is the Eaton Fire in Pasadena and Altadena. That is fully uncontained. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Liz Baker reports on damage from the Eaton Fire in one neighborhood. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=36.0s)]
*  Clusters of colorful bungalows, some 100 years old, used to give this Altadena neighborhood a lived-in, cheerful character. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Hole blocks are reduced to only two colors now, black and white, char and ash. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=47.36s)]
*  Everything seems to be gone. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Smoke still curls out of the ruins of the place 21-year-old Brian Jacobo and his parents and six siblings have called home for a decade. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=54.56s)]
*  They fled on foot earlier this week, blinded by thick smoke, forced to leave everything behind. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  I had three cats right here. I don't know what happened to them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=67.28s)]
*  Everything's going through my head. They could have ran. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=70.16s)]
*  Jacobo and his family are staying in a shelter for now. He says he doesn't know where they're going to go next. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=72.72s)]
*  Liz Baker, NPR News, Los Angeles. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=77.68s)]
*  Video-sharing app TikTok goes to the Supreme Court today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=80.32s)]
*  It's asking the justices to block a federal law that bans the app. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=83.52s)]
*  The Justice Department says TikTok's owner is based in China and that Chinese ownership poses a huge security risk to Americans' data. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=87.52s)]
*  TikTok says it's done a lot to distance itself from its Chinese-based parent company and that should be enough. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=95.52s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen says if the law stays in place, the ban takes effect this month. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  The Supreme Court upholds the law. It could start very soon. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=106.16s)]
*  Apple and Google will then be legally required to remove TikTok from app stores. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=109.44s)]
*  Web hosting firms like Oracle that support TikTok have to cut ties. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=114.56s)]
*  It could be the beginning of the end for TikTok. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=118.72s)]
*  Now, if the Supreme Court strikes down the law, well, then it's just business as usual for the app. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=122.24s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen reporting. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=126.88s)]
*  Vice President-elect J.D. Vance has resigned from the Senate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=129.36s)]
*  The now former Ohio senator stepped down from office before he and President-elect Trump take their new oaths of office on January 20th. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=132.96s)]
*  NPR's Claudia Cressellas has more. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  In his resignation letter, Vice President-elect Vance told Ohio Governor Mike DeWine that it has been, quote, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  a tremendous honor and privilege to serve the people of Ohio in the Senate for the last two years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  The move will give DeWine a Republican extra time to appoint someone to fill Vance's seat until a special election in 2026. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=157.52s)]
*  Even in his short tenure, Vance had already become the state's most senior senator. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=167.44s)]
*  Vance's resignation will also narrow Senate Republicans majority to 51 members, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPr3PbcDX2A&t=173.20000000000002s)]
