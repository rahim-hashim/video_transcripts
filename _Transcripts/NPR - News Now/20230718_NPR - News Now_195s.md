# Search Continues For Philadelphia-Area Kids Swept Away By Floodwaters | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8)
*  The search continues for two Philadelphia area children swept away by floodwaters over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=0.0s)]
*  And Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville continues to block new U.S. military appointments. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=11.0s)]
*  Search teams in Pennsylvania are still looking for two young children swept away by flash flooding north of Philadelphia last weekend. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=16.0s)]
*  From member station WHYY, Sophia Schmidt reports five other people were killed, including the children's mother. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=23.0s)]
*  Those killed in Saturday's flash flooding in Upper Makefield Township, Pennsylvania ranged in age from 32 to 78. All died from drowning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=29.0s)]
*  Upper Makefield Fire Chief Tim Brewer said the victims did not drive into the floodwaters. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=39.0s)]
*  They were caught. This was a flash flood. And this was the meaning of a flash flood. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=45.0s)]
*  Every one of these people were caught in the water. The wall of water came to them. They did not go into the water. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=52.0s)]
*  The search for the two missing children, a nine-month-old and a two-year-old, will continue. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=58.0s)]
*  Officials say they're pulling in assistance from other parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=63.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sophia Schmidt in Philadelphia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=68.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service says heat records could fall in the south and southwest today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=71.0s)]
*  Triple-digit temperatures are expected from California to southern Florida. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=76.0s)]
*  Forecasters say it hit 126 degrees yesterday in Death Valley, California. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=80.0s)]
*  The White House is repeating its call to Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville to stop blocking military appointments. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=86.0s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports this move has stopped hundreds of military promotions from going forward. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=94.0s)]
*  Senator Tuberville has refused to budge, citing his opposition to a Pentagon policy that reimburses service members who travel out of state to have an abortion. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=100.0s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Corrine Jean-Pierre says Tuberville is single-handedly hurting military readiness. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=111.0s)]
*  We're not the problem here. We're not causing this. This is the senator who's causing this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=118.0s)]
*  He's causing something that has never been done before. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=123.0s)]
*  The House on Friday passed its version of the National Defense Authorization Act, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=126.0s)]
*  which includes a provision that would reverse the Pentagon abortion policy. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=131.0s)]
*  Although that language is not likely to make it into the Senate version of the bill. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=137.0s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=142.0s)]
*  Ukraine says it'll work with the United Nations and Turkey to continue shipping Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=144.0s)]
*  Russia said it will stop participating in an agreement to allow its agricultural products and Ukrainian grain to ship safely despite the war. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=151.0s)]
*  UN Secretary-General António Guterres says Russia decided to pull out of the deal and that choice will hurt hungry people. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=159.0s)]
*  Ultimately, participation in these agreements is a choice. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=167.0s)]
*  But struggling people everywhere and developing countries don't have a choice. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=172.0s)]
*  Russian officials say Ukraine is at fault. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=179.0s)]
*  That's because Russia claims yesterday Ukraine blew up part of the key bridge linking mainland Russia with the annexed region of Crimea. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=182.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnDDQN6Lt8&t=190.0s)]
