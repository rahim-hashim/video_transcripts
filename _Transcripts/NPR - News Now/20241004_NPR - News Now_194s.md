# Dockworkers Suspend Three-Day Strike | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw)
*  A three-day strike comes to an end as port companies and the dock workers union reach [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=0.0s)]
*  a tentative contract deal. And hospitals across the country are facing a shortage of IV fluids [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=4.64s)]
*  in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=10.08s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. Unionized dock workers have suspended their strike against more [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  than a dozen ports in the eastern Gulf Coast. They agreed on wage increases in a six-year contract. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  This week, President Biden said some ocean carriers saw their profits grow by 800% [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  during the pandemic. NPR's Andrea Hsu says the dock workers have been demanding a share. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=32.0s)]
*  The union had wanted 77% in raises over six years. The companies had offered close to 50%. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=37.2s)]
*  The White House was working furiously behind the scenes talking to the companies, talking to the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=44.64s)]
*  union, trying to get them back to the table. And it appeared in the end they met somewhere in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=48.72s)]
*  middle. They landed on the 62% increase over six years. That's according to people familiar with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=52.88s)]
*  the talks who weren't authorized to speak. NPR's Andrea Hsu reporting. There's still an [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  outstanding issue, that of automation. The union says it doesn't want its workers replaced by [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=62.88s)]
*  technology. Both sides have agreed to extend their contract till mid-January and will go on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=68.4s)]
*  negotiating. The death toll from Hurricane Helene has now risen to at least 210 people across [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=73.76s)]
*  southeastern states. Scores of people are still missing, including in Tennessee and North Carolina. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=79.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, hospitals across the country may face a shortage of IV fluids because of storm damage. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=86.0s)]
*  Flooding stopped production at a crucial production facility in North Carolina. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=91.76s)]
*  From member station GBH in Boston, Craig LaMoult reports. Baxter International supplies about 60% [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  of IV fluids used in the U.S. The company says it's working to bring the flooded plant back online [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=102.64s)]
*  as soon as possible. In the meantime, Baxter is scaling back what it supplies to hospitals. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=107.92s)]
*  Dr. Kimi Kobayashi of UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester says the hospital is trying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=112.48s)]
*  to conserve the fluids it has. It's hard to put a number on it, but if this goes into a couple weeks, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=117.2s)]
*  I am sure that this will become very challenging if we cannot get, you know, meaningful replacement [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=122.72s)]
*  of supply. Several hospitals in Massachusetts say they'll continue normal clinical care for as long [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=127.76s)]
*  as they can. For NPR News, I'm Craig LaMoult in Boston. Minnesota Governor Tim Wal spoke [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=132.96s)]
*  at a virtual summit yesterday hosted by one of the nation's largest Muslim American voter [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=137.6s)]
*  mobilization groups. The appearance is part of an effort by the Harris campaign to win over Arab [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=142.48s)]
*  and Muslim Americans who are disenchanted with the Democratic Party's ongoing support for Israel. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=148.24s)]
*  Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters has more. The Harris-Walls campaign recently picked up the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=154.0s)]
*  endorsement of Engage. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz gave a brief speech to the group in which [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  he said the war in the Middle East must end now. Our hearts are broken. The concern of the Vice [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=164.48s)]
*  President and Harris and I is on our minds every day. The scale of death and destruction in Gaza [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  is staggering and devastating. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed, families feeing for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  safety over and over again. Engage has a significant presence in the key battleground states of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=182.16s)]
*  Michigan and Pennsylvania. For NPR News, I'm Clay Masters. You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz8HzHk2klw&t=186.88s)]
