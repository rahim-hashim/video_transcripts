*  Russian President Vladimir Putin says he has control after a brief rebellion by a mercenary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=0.0s)]
*  group. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=5.0s)]

*  abortion ban. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=10.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=11.0s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=12.0s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin is reestablishing control over his country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=16.04s)]
*  He gave a speech late last night. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=20.32s)]
*  This follows a short-lived rebellion by the mercenary Wagner group. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=22.6s)]
*  That lasted a day and ended when Wagner founder Evgeny Prigozhin agreed to go into exile in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=26.7s)]

*  insurrection charge against Prigozhin and the rest of the Wagner fighters. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=50.26s)]
*  The question now seems to be whether Prigozhin will keep his end of whatever bargain he [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=54.5s)]
*  made with Putin. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=58.18s)]

*  South Carolina's Supreme Court will hear a challenge of the state's six-week abortion [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=77.22s)]
*  ban today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=81.18s)]
*  This will be the second time a law severely restricting the procedure comes before the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=82.3s)]

*  from a six-week ban passed in 2021 that the state Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=103.86s)]
*  in January? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=109.86s)]

*  signed a law prohibiting abortions with limited exceptions once cardiac activity is detected, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLj6GTNwp_U&t=116.92s)]
