# Perry, Iowa, Mourns 6th-Grader Killed In School Shooting | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao)
*  Residents in Perry, Iowa held a vigil last night after a sixth grader was killed and five others were injured in a school shooting yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=0.0s)]
*  And the antiviral drug Paxlovid may not prevent long COVID. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=8.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=12.0s)]
*  The White House has released U.S. intelligence showing Russia has recently launched several North Korean ballistic missiles into Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=17.0s)]
*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, this comes as the Biden administration pushes Congress for billions of dollars to help Ukraine in its war effort. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=24.0s)]
*  White House National Security spokesman John Kirby says the missiles can travel as much as 550 miles and their use on December 30th and January 2nd marks a significant and concerning escalation in support from North Korea to Russia in its ongoing war against Ukraine. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=32.0s)]
*  We expect Russia and North Korea to learn from these launches and we anticipate that Russia will use additional North Korean missiles to target Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=50.0s)]
*  Kirby declined to answer questions about how many additional North Korean ballistic missiles Russia may have at its disposal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=61.0s)]
*  But he again called on Congress to pass additional funding to supply weapons and air defense systems to Ukraine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=68.0s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News, The White House. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=75.0s)]
*  President Biden will deliver a campaign speech in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania today. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=78.0s)]
*  A senior Biden adviser says he is expected to name former President Donald Trump as a threat to American democracy and values. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=83.0s)]
*  The Valley Forge site is symbolic of the Revolutionary War. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=91.0s)]
*  The speech comes on the eve of the anniversary of the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=95.0s)]
*  Trump has said if he is elected, he will pardon rioters for their criminal actions. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=101.0s)]
*  Authorities in Perry, Iowa say that a high school student killed a sixth grade student at Perry High School yesterday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=107.0s)]
*  He then killed himself. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=115.0s)]
*  Officials say four students and a school administrator were also injured. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=117.0s)]
*  Residents of Perry, a town about 40 miles from Des Moines, held a vigil last night. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=121.0s)]
*  Andrea Niemeyer is a Perry High School graduate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=126.0s)]
*  Know that even though we are a tiny town, the whole world is wrapping its arms around us. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=129.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Perry, Iowa police are looking for the shooter's motive. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=135.0s)]
*  A new study finds that taking the COVID antiviral drug, Paxlovid, does not reduce the chance of later developing chronic symptoms known as long COVID. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=139.0s)]
*  NPR's Will Stone has more. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=149.0s)]
*  There had been some hope that taking Paxlovid when you first get infected would make it unlikely you'd later end up with long COVID. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=152.0s)]
*  Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, set out to answer that question. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=159.0s)]
*  They compared about 350 people who took Paxlovid with those who didn't. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=164.0s)]
*  No one was hospitalized and the participants were vaccinated. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=168.0s)]
*  Dr. Matthew Durstenfeld at UCSF was the study's author. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=171.0s)]
*  The Paxlovid did not actually prevent them from developing long COVID when we surveyed them on average about six months later. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=175.0s)]
*  There's separate research currently going on to see whether a course of Paxlovid can help symptoms once someone has long COVID. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=181.0s)]
*  Will Stone, NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBGERpOqao&t=188.0s)]
