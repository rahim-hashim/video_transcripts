# Hamas Seeking Extension Of Four-Day Pause In Hostilities | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ)
*  Talks continue over extending the four-day pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And memorial services will begin today for former First Lady Rosalynn Carter. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=5.72s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=10.0s)]
*  This is the fourth and final day of an agreed-to pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=14.52s)]
*  The militants are expected to release more hostages today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Israel is expected to set free more Palestinians from Israeli jails. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=23.2s)]
*  As NPR's Brian Mann reports, talks are continuing to extend the pause in fighting. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=27.32s)]
*  The first three days have gone relatively smoothly with Israeli and other foreign hostages released by Hamas. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  And Palestinian prisoners held by Israel also freed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=37.72s)]
*  Work is now underway for a fourth exchange later today. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Michael Barsinei is from Kibbutz Beri. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=43.92s)]
*  And the Israeli community hit hard by Hamas' October 7 attack. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=46.32s)]
*  As long as we get hostages back, that's fine. It's not all of them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=50.32s)]
*  We remember all those that are still there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=54.52s)]
*  Yesterday, Hamas offered to extend the temporary truce the Israeli government signaled to openness to a longer pause in fighting [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=57.92s)]
*  while more hostage-prisoner exchanges are carried out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=64.12s)]
*  United Nations officials say if the deal is extended, it would allow more food and medical supplies to reach civilians in Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=66.92s)]
*  Brian Mann, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=73.52000000000001s)]

*  Dear Heavenly Father, this week, at this moment, I just thank you especially for the life of Rosalynn Carter. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=111.92s)]

*  And, Piers Alina Seljuk reports, the total for the holiday season is expected to set a record despite economic concerns. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=140.32s)]
*  So far, Black Friday already cleared last year's record. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=147.52s)]
*  Just online, Americans spent almost $10 billion, up 7.5% from last holiday. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=150.92000000000002s)]

*  Categories seeing the biggest jumps in sales are electronics, clothes, toys, and jewelry. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  In stores, Black Friday, as always, proved to be the most popular day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=176.12s)]
*  Sensormatic Solutions, which analyzes retail foot traffic, says the next busiest days in stores are going to be the two Saturdays before Christmas. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FpTOlgemUQ&t=180.12s)]
