# Trump Reportedly Fires National Security Agency Director | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg)
*  China is set to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, and the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=0.0s)]
*  has reportedly fired the director of the National Security Agency. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=5.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=9.88s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=10.88s)]
*  Stock markets in Asia and Europe dropped sharply today, reacting to yesterday's enormous losses [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=14.64s)]
*  on Wall Street. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=19.32s)]
*  This morning, in pre-market trading, Dow Jones' industrial average futures are down by more [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=20.66s)]
*  than 1,100 points. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  These drops come after President Trump announced worldwide tariffs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=27.22s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley has more. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=30.82s)]
*  Trump has ordered tariffs that are not only higher but also broader than those we've seen [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=32.98s)]
*  before. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=36.62s)]
*  He's planning to tax all kinds of things that we do not and cannot produce at scale here, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=37.62s)]
*  like tropical fruit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=41.46s)]
*  You know, even with global warming, I don't think we're going to start growing a lot of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=43.18s)]
*  bananas in the U.S. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=45.54s)]
*  So we're going to import the bananas, but Americans are going to pay more for them, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=46.54s)]
*  and nervous shoppers have already started to dial back their spending. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=49.94s)]

*  In coordinated statements, government ministries laid out the details of China's retaliation, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=62.02s)]
*  which sharply escalates the trade war between the world's two biggest economies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=66.02s)]
*  The finance ministry will impose a 34 percent tariff on all U.S. imports. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=70.02s)]
*  That's the same rate that the Trump administration imposed on China during Wednesday's so-called [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  Liberation Day global tariff blitz. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  China's tariffs take effect on April 10th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=81.66s)]

*  to a so-called unreliable entities list, effectively blacklisting them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=89.41999999999999s)]
*  It also said it's imposing export controls on a handful of rare earth minerals, making [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=93.78s)]
*  it harder for American companies to buy them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  And China's customs department is suspending farm product import qualifications for several [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=100.34s)]

*  that cheap imports have harmed their industry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=116.9s)]
*  About 80 percent of all seafood consumed in the United States is imported, and a big portion [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=120.06s)]
*  of that is foreign shrimp. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=125.3s)]
*  Shrimp that U.S. fishers say is subsidized, driving down prices and driving them out of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=127.74s)]
*  business. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=132.98s)]

*  It makes us feel like we finally have somebody looking out for the little guy, and we may [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=143.82s)]
*  be able to continue a heritage that we're very proud of and feed our country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lETy4tjE8Rg&t=148.1s)]
