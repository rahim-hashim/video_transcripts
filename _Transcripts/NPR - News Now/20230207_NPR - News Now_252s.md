# Rescue Efforts Continue After Earthquakes in Turkey, Syria; Biden's SOTU Address | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ)
*  President Biden will deliver his State of the Union address tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And rescue workers are racing to find survivors of the catastrophic earthquakes that hit Syria and Turkey yesterday. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=3.2s)]
*  A warning, some of these images may be hard to view. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=10.24s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=14.08s)]
*  Thousands of rescue workers in Turkey and Syria are racing to try to find earthquake survivors. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=18.72s)]
*  Many victims are trapped in the rubble of hundreds of buildings destroyed by yesterday's tremor and hundreds of aftershocks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=23.68s)]
*  NPR's Rob Schmitz reports from Istanbul. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=29.92s)]
*  Freezing winter temperatures, snow and dozens of aftershocks are hampering efforts by more than 20,000 rescue workers as they search for survivors throughout the affected region. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  By midday in Turkey, the death toll from the quake surpassed 5,000 people with more than four times that injured from the quake and its aftershocks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  The World Health Organization warns the final death toll from the two countries could surpass 20,000. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=50.72s)]
*  Dozens of countries, including the U.S., have dispatched search and rescue teams to Turkey. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=56.72s)]
*  In Syria, the head of the Arab Red Crescent urged countries to lift their sanctions on the country and deliver the heavy equipment needed to rescue people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=61.36s)]
*  Rob Schmitz, NPR News, Istanbul. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=69.44s)]
*  President Biden delivers the State of the Union tonight. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=72.0s)]
*  The primetime speech gives Biden the chance to make a case for himself to a broad audience ahead of an expected announcement that he's running for a second term. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=74.72s)]
*  NPR's Scott Detro has more. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=82.64s)]
*  Returning to the White House on Marine One after a long weekend of speech prep at Camp David, Biden told reporters he views the speech as a conversation with the American people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=84.8s)]
*  It will come as Biden sees momentum from a stronger than expected economy with low unemployment and cooling inflation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=93.84s)]
*  But Biden also faces challenges. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=100.88s)]
*  A Republican-controlled House is launching investigations and threatening a standoff over the debt ceiling. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=102.96s)]
*  And the Department of Justice is still investigating classified documents found at his home and private office. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=108.96s)]
*  The president is expected to focus on the major bipartisan infrastructure law funding projects across the country, as he's been doing in recent weeks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=115.52s)]
*  Scott Detro, NPR News, The White House. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=124.0s)]
*  Emergency responders in Ohio say they have averted a catastrophe from a derailed freight train that caught fire. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=126.24s)]
*  Several cars held toxic chemicals. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=133.12s)]
*  These have been safely drained from the cars, avoiding an explosion. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  Ohio Governor Mike DeWine had ordered people to evacuate who lived nearby. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=139.84s)]
*  The Allegheny Friends' Julie Grant says human exposure to the chemicals, if the rail cars blew up, could have been extreme. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=144.8s)]
*  Skin burns, lung damage and even death. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  And this is why Governor DeWine of Ohio was so adamant that people evacuate the area. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=154.84s)]
*  They didn't see any harmful air quality measurements yesterday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=160.68s)]
*  The Ohio EPA is monitoring air quality and officials say that now clean up and remediation at the site can continue safely. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=164.36s)]
*  She spoke to NPR's Morning Edition. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  A House committee holds a hearing today about funding the Federal Aviation Administration. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=176.68s)]
*  Last month, an FAA computer outage forced a brief nationwide ground stop of all departing flights that lasted for about an hour and a half. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says he fears prospects for peace between Russia and Ukraine are diminishing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=192.0s)]
*  Linda Fasula reports Guterres spoke to the UN General Assembly yesterday. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres stressed he thought the chances of further escalation and bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war keep growing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=204.12s)]
*  And the world, he said, is walking into a wider war with, quote, its eyes wide open. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=212.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, the UN's humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, told Security Council members that aid workers are doing their best to help Ukrainians and have reached nearly 16 million people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  But he said relief efforts need to expand in order to reach more people more frequently. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=228.56s)]
*  Griffiths said he will launch a 3.9 billion dollar appeal later this month. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=233.88s)]
*  Some 650 humanitarian organizations are currently working across Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Linda Fasula in New York. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxMTKM7dnAQ&t=244.35999999999999s)]
