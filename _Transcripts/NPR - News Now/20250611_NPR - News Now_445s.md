**NPR - News Now:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4)
*  Los Angeles' mayor implemented a curfew for some of downtown LA last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=0.0s)]
*  This follows days of protests against immigration raids in the city. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=5.44s)]
*  And billionaire Elon Musk has expressed regret about online statements he made about President [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=9.44s)]
*  Trump last week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=14.34s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=16.22s)]
*  I'm Curova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=17.22s)]
*  Reports from Los Angeles say the city has been quieter overnight following days of peaceful [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=21.14s)]
*  protests and some violent clashes with police. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=25.34s)]
*  Faith leaders have called for nonviolent resistance to federal immigration raids in the area. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=28.82s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has declared an overnight curfew for a specific part of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=33.82s)]
*  downtown LA. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  She says while the whole city encompasses a little more than 500 square miles, the curfew [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=40.14s)]
*  applies to one square mile of downtown LA. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=45.08s)]
*  It is extremely important to know that what is happening in this one square mile is not [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=48.22s)]
*  affecting the city. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=54.58s)]
*  Some of the imagery of the protests and the violence gives the appearance as though this [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=56.3s)]
*  is a citywide crisis and it is not. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=62.18s)]
*  LA officials say there's been a torrent of misinformation published online about the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=65.42s)]
*  protests, much of it aimed at immigrants and political leaders. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=69.89999999999999s)]
*  President Trump has deployed thousands of U.S. troops to LA. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=74.3s)]
*  He says he has saved the city from burning down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=77.7s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom has given a speech saying Trump is abusing his power. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=80.38s)]
*  Steve Futterman reports. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=85.38s)]
*  During an eight-minute address, Newsom said the president is undermining due process rights [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=86.78s)]
*  and is pulling a military dragnet across LA. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=91.94s)]
*  He specifically criticized the deployment of 700 Marines. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=95.42s)]
*  We honor their service. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=99.38s)]
*  We honor their bravery. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=100.66s)]
*  But we do not want our streets militarized by our own armed forces, not in LA, not in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=102.69999999999999s)]
*  California, not anywhere. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=108.34s)]
*  He said Trump is choosing theatrics over public safety. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=110.3s)]
*  Newsom said California will continue fighting. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=113.98s)]
*  In federal court, the state is challenging the use of the Marines and the National Guard. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=116.86s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=122.26s)]
*  It's not just in Los Angeles. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=126.14s)]
*  Protests against federal immigration raids have been held in many major cities in recent [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=128.54s)]
*  days. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=133.1s)]
*  They include New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, Denver, Philadelphia, Seattle, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=134.1s)]
*  and more. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  In Chicago, thousands of protesters turned out to demonstrate against immigration raids. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=141.14s)]
*  No cops, no violence, no practice, no justice. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=146.1s)]
*  Chicago police say that at one point a car drove into that crowd of protesters. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  It's not clear if anyone was hurt and it's not clear if the driver has been arrested. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=154.38s)]
*  An appeal hearing for President Trump's criminal conviction is set to take place in Manhattan [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  this morning. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=163.54s)]
*  As NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports, it's the latest attempt by the president's legal team to move [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=164.61999999999998s)]
*  the historic case to federal court. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=169.34s)]
*  Trump was tried, convicted, and sentenced in the New York state court system. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=171.82s)]
*  His lawyers have tried and failed twice before to get the case moved to federal court, citing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=176.0s)]
*  a specific law that allows federal officials to make such a move if the case involves conduct [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=180.26s)]
*  well in office. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  But the hush money payment at the heart of the case occurred before the 2016 election [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=187.06s)]
*  when Trump was still a candidate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=191.22s)]
*  Now Trump's lawyers are trying a third time, arguing that prosecutors relied on evidence [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=193.02s)]
*  in trial related to Trump's official acts as president. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=197.5s)]
*  Legal experts tell NPR there's a good chance it won't work. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=201.5s)]
*  A three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit will ultimately decide. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=204.78s)]
*  Trump has also appealed the conviction through the New York state courts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=210.06s)]

*  Billionaire Elon Musk is lamenting statements he made about President Trump last week. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=216.46s)]
*  It's an apparent easing of their public feud. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=221.5s)]
*  The two traded insults after Musk criticized the multi-trillion dollar tax and spending [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=224.32s)]
*  bill that Trump backs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Rylan Barton has more. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=231.28s)]
*  In a two-sentence post on X, Musk said he regretted some of his posts about Trump, saying [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  that they, quote, went too far. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=238.62s)]
*  A week ago, Musk called Trump's mega bill a disgusting abomination. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=240.6s)]
*  In response, Trump threatened to slash federal subsidies and contracts to Musk's companies, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=244.84s)]
*  And then Musk claimed, without evidence, that Trump appears in government files about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=249.84s)]
*  convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  Musk deleted that post and some others on Saturday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=257.2s)]
*  Trump said last week his relationship with Musk was over and warned of serious consequences. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=260.28000000000003s)]

*  inciting violence against Palestinians. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=272.88s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio is criticizing the sanctions as NPR's Michelle Kelleman [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=275.84s)]
*  reports. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=280.56s)]

*  Rubio says in a statement that these sanctions do not advance U.S. efforts to reach a ceasefire [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=293.96s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=299.55999999999995s)]

*  It accuses the two far-right cabinet members of inciting, quote, extremist violence and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=309.08000000000004s)]

*  It began Monday after two Romanian-speaking teens were arraigned in court for alleged [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=350.46s)]

*  Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson spoke to reporters. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6OLF-qeta4&t=366.12s)]
