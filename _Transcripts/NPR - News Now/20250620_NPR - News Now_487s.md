# Judges Back Trump's Command Of California's National Guard | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q)
*  European and Iran's top diplomats are set to meet today in Geneva for talks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump can continue to command California's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=6.28s)]
*  National Guard in Los Angeles. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=11.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=13.68s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston from NPR News, and here are some of today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=14.68s)]
*  European diplomats are gathering today in Geneva amid the escalating conflict between [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=19.52s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=25.48s)]
*  The foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss Tehran's nuclear program with Iran's top [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=27.56s)]
*  diplomat. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Frere reports this is the first round of face-to-face talks with Iranian officials [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  since Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran last week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=39.72s)]
*  The foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the European Union are all meeting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=44.06s)]
*  Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Arachi. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=48.62s)]
*  The Europeans are urging a return to diplomacy after days of war. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=51.56s)]
*  But Tehran wants Israeli bombings to end first, with Iranian state TV quoting Arachi as saying [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=55.7s)]
*  there's no room for negotiations with the U.S. until Israeli aggression stops. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  The Trump administration says it'll decide within two weeks whether to join Israeli attacks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=67.94s)]
*  British Foreign Minister David Lammy says that's the window now for any diplomatic solution. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=73.42s)]
*  Lauren Frere, NPR News, London. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=79.10000000000001s)]
*  And Trump continues to weigh whether the U.S. will enter the war between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=81.82s)]
*  The White House says he'll make the decision within the next two weeks. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=87.77999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonstorf reports the U.S. possesses a bomb that is thought to be capable of reaching [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=91.82s)]
*  even Iran's most well-protected nuclear facility. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=97.74s)]
*  The most fortified nuclear facility in Iran is called Fordow, located deep inside a mountain. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=101.85999999999999s)]
*  And the U.S. has the only bomb that could damage it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=107.82s)]
*  Because of its size, that 30,000-pound bomb can only be carried by a B-2 stealth bomber. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=110.68s)]
*  Also something only the U.S. has. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  Most experts agree that the bomb could cause serious, possibly even debilitating, damage [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  to the facility, although it could take several hits. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  The real question is whether that would stop Iran's nuclear program, or simply put it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=125.86000000000001s)]
*  on hold, as Iran would still have the scientists and knowledge to start it back up again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=129.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned such an attack could cause [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=134.4s)]
*  radioactive contamination. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=138.76s)]
*  Kat Lonstorf, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=140.84s)]
*  A federal appeals court says President Trump can keep control of the National Guard troops [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=142.76s)]
*  deployed to Los Angeles. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Steve Futterman reports the state had filed a lawsuit. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  The unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel means that the National Guard troops can stay [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=154.76s)]
*  deployed here in L.A. California Governor Gavin Newsom had argued that the president [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=159.12s)]
*  exceeded his powers when he federalized the troops. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=164.44s)]
*  But the panel concluded that the conditions in L.A., with police and protesters having [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=167.76s)]
*  repeated confrontations, were sufficient enough to give the president the power to take such [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=172.34s)]
*  action. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=177.76s)]
*  Trump called it a big win in his social media post. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=178.76s)]
*  A district court had previously ruled that the protests did not pose enough of a threat [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=182.04s)]
*  to allow Trump to deploy the guard. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=186.84s)]
*  This does not end the battle. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  California is still trying to restrict what National Guard troops can do while they are [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  deployed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=197.72s)]
*  Ice immigration raids have continued at a number of home depots and some car washes [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  in Los Angeles. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=207.24s)]
*  Steve Futterman reports the Los Angeles Dodgers say agents who showed up at their stadium [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=208.8s)]
*  on Thursday were turned away. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=214.0s)]
*  In a social media post, the L.A. Dodgers say ICE agents came to the stadium and requested [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=216.84s)]
*  permission to access the parking lots. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  The Dodgers say they were denied entry. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=224.56s)]
*  The team did not indicate why ICE might have wanted to enter the parking areas. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=227.8s)]
*  DHS responded saying, quote, this had nothing to do with the Dodgers. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=231.3s)]
*  The agency's post says that customs and border protection vehicles were in the parking lot [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  briefly, quote, unrelated to any operation or enforcement. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=241.34s)]
*  The Dodgers have come under criticism by some fans for essentially saying nothing last week [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  about the ICE operations and protests in L.A. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=255.5s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says Ottawa will impose new tariffs on U.S. steel and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=259.06s)]
*  aluminum imports starting on July 21st. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  But as Dan Karpenchuk reports, Carney says that will depend on trade negotiations with [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=268.7s)]
*  the United States. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=274.46s)]
*  Carney would not say what the new tariffs would be, but July 21st coincides with the end of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=275.94s)]
*  the 30-day deadline for a trade deal that was mentioned when Carney and President Trump [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=280.18s)]
*  met on the sidelines of the G7. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=284.66s)]
*  Carney also says Ottawa will limit federal procurement policies to favor Canadian suppliers [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=286.86s)]
*  and what he describes as reliable trading partners. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=291.86s)]
*  And he will announce new retroactive tariff quota rates on imports of steel products from [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=294.98s)]

*  There will also be task forces for steel and aluminum to help guide the government's [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  decision-making. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=308.98s)]

*  He says there are too many people in the government intent on obstructing his policies and goals. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  Now his administration is taking steps to convert tens of thousands of civil servants [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=348.74s)]
*  into at-will employees, those whose jobs are, quote, policy influencing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=353.78s)]

*  people elected him to do. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SOOf9zj1-Q&t=363.58s)]
