# U.K.'s Labour Party Sweeps To Power In Historic Landslide | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw)
*  Live from NPR News in Washington, I'm Windsor Johnston. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=0.0s)]
*  The United Kingdom's Labour Party has handed the nation's conservatives a crushing defeat [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=5.12s)]
*  in Thursday's parliamentary election. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=11.28s)]
*  In his first official remarks as Prime Minister, Keir Starmer pledged to lead a government [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  of service on a mission of national renewal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  Changing a country is not like flicking a switch. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  The world is now a more volatile place. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=25.84s)]
*  This will take a while, but have no doubt that the work of change begins immediately. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=29.32s)]
*  After 14 years under a conservative majority, former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=36.68s)]
*  conceded defeat, apologizing to his supporters. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  To the country, I would like to say first and foremost, I am sorry. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=46.36s)]
*  I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=52.0s)]
*  the United Kingdom must change. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=57.72s)]
*  King Charles welcomed Keir Starmer to Buckingham Palace this morning to officially appoint [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=60.0s)]
*  him as Britain's new Prime Minister. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=65.44s)]
*  Hurricane Beryl has made landfall along Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with wind speeds topping [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=69.4s)]
*  100 miles per hour. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=75.48s)]
*  National Hurricane Center specialist Jack Beaven says forecasters are closely tracking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=77.88s)]
*  the path of the storm as it makes its way toward the U.S. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=82.7s)]
*  What we are looking at right now is that the impacts of the storm will start up on [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=86.76s)]
*  the Texas coast probably sometime Sunday, could be Saturday night, but more likely sometime [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=91.72s)]
*  Sunday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=97.4s)]
*  And then potential landfall is just too early to tell. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=98.4s)]
*  If it goes a little faster, a little further south, the landfall would be possibly Sunday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  If it goes further north and slower, it could be Monday. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=106.4s)]
*  The hurricane battered several Caribbean islands this week, including Jamaica and the Caymans. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=109.28s)]
*  People say at least nine people have died in the storm. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=115.56s)]
*  The U.S. economy continued to add jobs at a healthy clip in June. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reports most of the gains came in health care, government and construction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  U.S. employers added 206,000 jobs in June, a modest slowdown from the previous month. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=130.96s)]
*  The unemployment rate inched up to 4.1 percent as nearly 300,000 new people joined the workforce. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=137.2s)]
*  Care continued its strong job growth, while construction companies also added workers [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=144.32s)]
*  despite high interest rates, which are weighing on the housing market. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  Factories and retailers shed a small number of jobs, and temporary help services cut nearly [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=151.68s)]
*  50,000 jobs. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  The labor market is still strong, but it has been gradually cooling. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=158.48s)]
*  One sign of that is average wages, which rose 3.9 percent over the last 12 months. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  It's the first time in three years that annual wage growth has dropped below 4 percent. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vseuz9TKqLw&t=167.6s)]
