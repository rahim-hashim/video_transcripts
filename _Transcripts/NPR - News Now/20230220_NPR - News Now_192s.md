**NPR - News Now:** [February 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs)
*  President Biden is on his way to Poland after making an unannounced visit to Kiev today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=0.0s)]
*  And there has been an outpouring of support for former President Jimmy Carter, who's now [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=5.44s)]
*  receiving hostis care. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=9.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=11.68s)]
*  I'm Nora Rahm from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=12.68s)]
*  President Biden made an unannounced visit to Kiev today in advance of the one-year anniversary [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=16.96s)]
*  of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=21.5s)]
*  He said he is reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Ukraine's democracy, sovereignty, and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=24.0s)]
*  territorial integrity. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=28.76s)]
*  The president also announced the U.S. will send a half a billion dollars of additional [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=30.64s)]
*  assistance to Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=34.88s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordoñez has more on the visit. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=36.52s)]
*  The president said that he wanted to leave no doubt about U.S. support for Ukraine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=39.28s)]
*  But as you note, the fact is there are some growing doubts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=44.08s)]
*  So part of this trip is about making a case to Americans back home that it's not just [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=46.8s)]
*  about Ukraine, that it's also important to the United States that Russia be stopped. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=51.52s)]
*  But you know, some Americans, particularly Republicans, think the U.S. is spending too [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=56.98s)]
*  much money. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=61.26s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordoñez. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=62.26s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Turkey. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=65.02s)]
*  Yesterday he viewed earthquake damage by helicopter and promised the U.S. would help Turkey to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=68.06s)]
*  recover and to rebuild for as long as it takes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=73.38s)]
*  Officials now estimate the death toll from the earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=77.34s)]
*  exceeds 46,000. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  More than a million people have lost their homes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=84.06s)]
*  Classes are resuming today at Michigan State University, where a shooting last week left [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=87.3s)]
*  three students dead and five hospitalized. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=92.3s)]
*  Argent Hocker from Member Station WKAR reports. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=95.34s)]
*  Classes at MSU have been suspended since the shooting occurred last Monday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=99.22s)]
*  The university has been holding community events and offering counseling resources to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=102.5s)]
*  students and staff. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  Some students have asked for the return to campus to be delayed so the community has [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=107.86s)]
*  more time to grieve. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=111.26s)]
*  But MSU interim provost Thomas Yajchko says the return to a learning environment will [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=112.76s)]
*  help everyone recover. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=116.56s)]
*  Coming back together is something that will help us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=118.04s)]
*  We're a community that was shaped around the interests of discovery and learning, and it [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=122.04s)]
*  is as a community that we will heal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  MSU says two buildings on campus where the shooting occurred will not be used for instruction [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  for the rest of the semester. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=133.52s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Arjun Thakkar in East Lansing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=135.26s)]
*  There's been an outpouring of support for former president Jimmy Carter who's now receiving [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=137.92000000000002s)]

*  At the Maranatha Baptist Church where former president Carter taught Sunday school for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=147.24s)]
*  decades, worshippers prayed for the Carter family after his foundation said he has decided [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  to forego additional medical intervention and spend his remaining time at home with [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=156.72s)]
*  his family. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=161.4s)]
*  Zach Steele is a deacon at the church. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=162.4s)]
*  He worked closely with Carter over the years. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  He's the bedrock of the character here and he's taught a lot of us to be better people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6OeyAIjtYs&t=166.32000000000002s)]
