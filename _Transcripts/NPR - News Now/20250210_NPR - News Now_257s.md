# Trump Plans 25% Tariffs On Steel, Aluminum Imports | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, February 10th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=2.72s)]
*  Most of the work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has stalled this morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=6.88s)]
*  The acting chief has told workers the Washington headquarters are closed for the week [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=11.28s)]
*  and they have to work from home. Critics say it appears the Trump administration is trying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=15.84s)]
*  to close down the agency. The recently fired former CFPB chief Rohit Chopra says this is a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=20.0s)]
*  law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=26.88s)]
*  whether it's a credit reporting agency or a large bank or a credit card giant. The CFPB has been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=34.32s)]
*  recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wrong. He spoke to NPR's morning edition. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=42.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump says that today he will announce a new 25 percent tariff on all steel and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=49.2s)]
*  aluminum imports into the U.S. And Piers Asmohallad has more. The president said these [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=55.36s)]
*  steel and aluminum tariffs will apply to everybody, even neighboring Canada and Mexico. Trump also said [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=60.8s)]
*  he'll be announcing reciprocal tariffs on other items that would apply to countries that impose [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=66.64s)]
*  duties on U.S. goods. Very simply, if they charge us, we charge them. He said he plans to roll out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  details at a news conference later this week. But if they are charging us 130 percent and we're [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=78.16s)]
*  charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way. Trump also told reporters that no foreign [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=83.68s)]
*  company should have a majority stake in U.S. steel. But he did encourage Japan's Nippon steel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  to make an investment in the revered American company. Asmohallad, NPR News. A federal judge [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  is scheduled to hear arguments today in Boston on whether the Trump administration's attempts to get [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=102.0s)]
*  federal workers to resign is legal. Employee unions sued over what the White House calls [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=107.28s)]
*  deferred resignation offers. The judge temporarily blocked that effort last Thursday and then extended [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=113.28s)]
*  the deadline for workers to decide until later today. The Israeli military has expanded its [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=119.52s)]
*  operation in the northern part of the occupied West Bank. Israel launched that operation just two days [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=125.68s)]
*  after the ceasefire in Gaza went into effect. And Piers Kath Lonsdorf reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=132.0s)]
*  Israel says it is conducting counterterrorism operations and that many of those killed were [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=138.4s)]
*  militants. On Sunday, a 23-year-old pregnant woman was killed by Israel in the Palestinian refugee [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=142.8s)]
*  camp of North Shamps. The Israeli military says it's opened an investigation into the incident. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=148.16s)]
*  This operation began in the Jenin refugee camp but has spread to others over several weeks. In [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=153.04s)]
*  a statement, the military says it is quote crushing terror infrastructure in the refugee camps and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=158.08s)]
*  preventing its resurgence. Palestinian officials in the camps say utilities like water and electricity [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=162.4s)]
*  have been destroyed during the raids. More than 74 Palestinians have been killed in this operation, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  including several children, according to Palestinian health officials. Kat Lonsdorf, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  The Philadelphia Eagles have won the Super Bowl and blocked the Kansas City Chiefs from winning [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=180.24s)]
*  a third championship in a row. From member station WHYY in Philadelphia, Corey Sharber has more. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=185.36s)]
*  Fans took to the streets in Philadelphia last night after the Eagles defeated the Kansas City [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=193.36s)]
*  Chiefs 40-22 in Super Bowl 59. The Eagles were led not only by Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=198.0s)]
*  but also Saquon Barkley, who ended up setting this season's rushing record. Gorkham Genniden was [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  soaking in the energy following the Eagles' championship victory. Seven years ago when we [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  first won our chip, I was 16. My dad didn't let me come to Philly because I was too young. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=214.4s)]
*  And now I'm so glad I get to be here for this championship. So I'm blessed. Sunday's victory [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  brought the Eagles their second Lombardi trophy. In 2018, they defeated the New England Patriots [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  in Super Bowl 52. For NPR News, I'm Corey Sharber in Philadelphia. There was a protester in the midst [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=230.4s)]
*  of the Super Bowl halftime performance by singer Kendrick Lamar, a performer held up a flag with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=236.96s)]
*  the words Gaza and Sudan written on it. The NFL says the person was a part of the cast on the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=241.84s)]
*  field, but no one involved knew the person's intent. The protester was tackled and detained. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=247.28s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman, NPR News in Washington. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tUg4iLN774&t=253.6s)]
