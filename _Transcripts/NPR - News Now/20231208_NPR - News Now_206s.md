# Hunter Biden Indicted On Federal Tax Charges | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U)
*  Hunter Biden has been indicted on federal tax charges and the teenager who shot and killed four of his classmates at a Michigan high school two years ago will be sentenced today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=10.44s)]
*  President Biden's son Hunter has been indicted on federal tax charges by a federal grand jury in California. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=14.64s)]
*  A special counsel is accusing Hunter Biden of failing to pay about one point four million dollars in taxes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=20.64s)]
*  The younger Biden has already been indicted on separate federal gun charges in Delaware. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=27.16s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas says Hunter Biden's lawyer is criticizing the new indictment. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  His attorney, Abbey Lowell, said in a statement last night that if Hunter's name was anything other than Biden, that none of these charges, not the gun charges or the new tax charges, would have been brought against him. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=36.72s)]
*  Lowell accused the special counsel of in essence folding under Republican pressure to go after Hunter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=47.24s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reporting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=52.24s)]
*  There's a sentencing hearing today for the teenager who shot and killed classmates at Michigan's Oxford High School two years ago. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=54.36s)]
*  From member station WDET, Quinn Klinefelter reports, Ethan Crumbly could spend life in prison. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=61.72s)]
*  Ethan Crumbly was 15 when he killed four Oxford high students, wounded seven other people, then calmly surrendered so he could watch the results of the carnage. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=68.08s)]
*  Prosecutors say those actions demand a sentence of life without parole. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=76.36s)]
*  Judge Kwame Roe says he doubts Crumbly could be rehabilitated, but Roe could still hand down a sentence other than life, anywhere from a minimum of 25 years in prison to a maximum of 60. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=80.76s)]
*  The sentencing hearing could help tip the scales of justice, with the judge likely hearing statements from survivors of the massacre, families of the victims and those speaking on Crumbly's behalf. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=92.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Quinn Klinefelter in Detroit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli military says it is still fighting Hamas militants in central and southern Gaza. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=105.72s)]
*  Health authorities in Gaza say more than 17,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since the Israel-Hamas war started. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=111.36s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Forces say 91 Israeli soldiers have been killed in its ground offensive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=119.68s)]
*  A new report card ranks the countries of the world on their human rights practices, assigning each nation a letter grade. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Finland got a high A. Iran came in last. NPR's Ari Daniels has more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  Countries were scored on 25 human rights, from freedom of speech to the absence of political imprisonment and child labor. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=140.44s)]
*  60 percent of the countries failed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  These are cases where improving human rights would probably have the biggest effect because there's the most room for improvement. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Skip Mark directs the Center for Nonviolence and Peace Studies at the University of Rhode Island and co-authored the report card. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=157.96s)]
*  He says overall, the more democratic a country, the better its human rights. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=165.04s)]
*  The U.S., however, violated various labor rights, women's rights and civil and political rights. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=169.4s)]
*  That's concerning, says Mark. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=175.32s)]
*  Human rights in the U.S. will decline unless democratic institutions are strengthened. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=177.0s)]
*  The U.S.'s grade on the report card, a D. Ari Daniel, NPR News. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=181.92s)]
*  The Pantone Color Institute has named its Color of the Year. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=187.48s)]
*  It is Peach Fuzz. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=191.04s)]
*  Pantone helps shape product development in everything from fashion to industrial design. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=193.16s)]
*  It says Peach Fuzz is gentle, warm and cozy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=198.84s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFrXfejDP0U&t=203.28s)]
