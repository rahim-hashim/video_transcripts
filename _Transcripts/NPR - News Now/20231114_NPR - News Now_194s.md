*  The House of Representatives is expected to vote today on a short-term spending bill. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=14.88s)]
*  It's to avoid a late Friday night government shutdown. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports Speaker Mike Johnson is facing defections from some Republicans who want deeper spending cuts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=21.42s)]
*  The proposal by Speaker Johnson is a two-step funding bill. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=28.34s)]

*  A block of House conservatives say they will vote no because the legislation continues current funding levels and they want steep spending cuts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=37.04s)]
*  With the razor-thin GOP majority, Johnson is going to need support of Democrats to pass the bill. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=46.18s)]
*  Maryland Democrats' Denny Hoyer criticized the GOP approach of setting two different deadlines, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=52.28s)]

*  They don't have electricity. They can't provide any real treatment. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=114.1s)]
*  They say patients are dying from a lack of care. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFoqnk09x8&t=117.5s)]
