# DOJ's 'Exhaustive Review' Finds No Evidence Of Epstein 'Client List' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs)
*  The death toll continues to rise in Texas, where the search is ongoing for victims of devastating flash floods over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Justice Department now says there's no evidence that Jeffrey Epstein kept a list of his clients. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kristen Wright from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=13.0s)]
*  It's a race against the clock to find survivors of the devastating flash flooding in Texas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=17.0s)]
*  Hope is fading at the same time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=23.0s)]
*  Ryan Logue is a volunteer with the United Cajun Navy. He spoke to ABC News. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=26.0s)]
*  We're out there early and we're out there until we're falling over. When you looked at these guys, we're exhausted. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=31.0s)]
*  They were emotionally tired by looking at the devastation, finding children's Bibles on the ground. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=37.0s)]
*  You know, looking through people's wreckage of their life, it takes a toll on you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=42.0s)]
*  Logue also explains how volunteers are clearing masses of debris in search of victims. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=47.0s)]
*  He says the search area is expansive with just piles of debris the size of multiple 18-wheelers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=54.0s)]
*  The death toll from the July 4th floods keeps rising with many people still missing today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=61.0s)]
*  The number of lives lost has surpassed 100, including 27 girls and counselors who were at sleepaway camp in Kerr County. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=67.0s)]
*  Questions are intensifying over how officials reacted to weather alerts, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=76.0s)]
*  forecasting the possibility of flash flooding and the lack of an early warning siren system. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=80.0s)]
*  Texas' Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told Fox News Monday the state would pay for a system in Kerrville by next summer if the city can't afford it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=85.0s)]
*  President Trump's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff is headed to Qatar, where Israeli and Hamas officials are negotiating a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=94.0s)]
*  Trump has said he's hopeful for a ceasefire deal this week. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=103.0s)]
*  NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=107.0s)]
*  A senior Israeli official told reporters that Israel and Hamas have resolved 80 to 90 percent of the terms of a ceasefire deal, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=110.0s)]
*  but that it could take more than just a few days to reach a final deal. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=118.0s)]
*  The agreement would include a 60-day ceasefire, exchanging hostages and prisoners. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=121.0s)]
*  The main disagreements include Israel's demand to keep troops in a corridor captured in recent months, cutting across Gaza, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=126.0s)]
*  and Hamas' demand for guarantees that talks during a ceasefire lead to a final end of war. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=134.0s)]
*  Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met yesterday in the White House. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=140.0s)]
*  Trump said the U.S. will hold talks with Iran following the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=144.0s)]
*  Netanyahu said he'd like a security pact and eventual peace between Israel and Syria. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=150.0s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=156.0s)]
*  The Justice Department and the FBI say they found no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=158.0s)]
*  who died in prison, kept a client list or blackmailed prominent associates. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=164.0s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=168.0s)]
*  Those are some of the conclusions contained in an unsigned two-page memo outlining the quote-unquote exhaustive review [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=170.0s)]
*  the department conducted of the Epstein files in its possession. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=176.0s)]
*  The memo also states that Epstein died by suicide, which aligns with previous department findings. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=180.0s)]
*  Epstein died at a federal lockup in New York City in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=186.0s)]
*  His death fueled conspiracy theories in large part because of his ties to the rich and powerful. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=193.0s)]
*  It's unclear whether the DOJ review and its conclusions will tamp down those theories, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=198.0s)]
*  particularly since Attorney General Pam Bondi said when asked in February about an alleged Epstein client list that, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=203.0s)]
*  quote, it's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=209.0s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=212.0s)]
*  There's word this morning that you may not have to keep taking off your shoes at security at some airports. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=214.0s)]
*  Multiple reports say the TSA is ending the requirement. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=220.0s)]
*  The agency, though, hasn't made an official announcement just yet. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=224.0s)]
*  President Trump set a 25 percent tariff on goods from major trading partners Japan and South Korea, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=228.0s)]
*  and shared letters he sent to several countries setting new rates and offering negotiations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=234.0s)]
*  The new tariff deadline is August 1st. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=239.0s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom is condemning the sudden appearance of federal immigration agents at a park in Los Angeles. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=242.0s)]
*  Officers and National Guard troops fanned out through MacArthur Park Monday morning on foot, horseback and in military vehicles. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=249.0s)]
*  The park is in an immigrant neighborhood. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=257.0s)]
*  I want folks to know we have your back and we'll continue to come back and do what we can to protect our diverse communities, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=259.0s)]
*  to protect the spirit that defines the best of this city and our state and to push back against this cruelty. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=268.0s)]
*  It is unclear if any arrests were made. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=276.0s)]
*  Newsom is suing the Trump administration over federalizing the California National Guard to oversee immigration enforcement. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=279.0s)]
*  Health Secretary Robert F. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=287.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=289.0s)]
*  is standing by his reforms at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=290.0s)]
*  As NPR's Will Stone reports, several medical groups are suing Kennedy over his vaccine policy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=294.0s)]
*  The lawsuit takes aim at Secretary Kennedy for removing healthy children and pregnant women from the COVID-19 vaccine schedule. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=300.0s)]
*  More broadly, the suit critiques what it describes as his efforts to undermine trust in vaccines. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=306.0s)]
*  The groups behind the lawsuit include the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Public Health Association, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=312.0s)]
*  as well as a pregnant physician who says they've been unable to get a COVID shot because of Kennedy's actions. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=319.0s)]
*  The suit also cites Kennedy's removal of a panel of experts on a federal vaccine committee. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=324.0s)]
*  It asks for the court to reverse Kennedy's changes to the COVID vaccine schedule. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=329.0s)]
*  Will Stone, NPR News. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=333.0s)]
*  A Swiss drug regulator approved the first malaria treatment specifically designed for newborns and infants. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=335.0s)]
*  As NPR's Jonathan Lambert explains, the drug fills a long-standing gap in treatment for the deadly disease. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=342.0s)]
*  Roughly 30 million babies are born in areas with high malaria risk across Africa. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=348.0s)]
*  There's not great data on how many are infected, but children under five account for nearly three-quarters of malaria deaths in the region. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=354.0s)]
*  When cases in newborns and the smallest infants get severe, doctors had been giving drugs designed for older children in smaller doses. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=362.0s)]
*  But babies metabolize drugs differently, so that strategy can potentially cause toxic overdose. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=370.0s)]
*  The new formulation is called Coartum Baby. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=376.0s)]
*  It was specifically formulated by the pharmaceutical company Novartis for newborns and small infants and can be dissolved into breast milk or formula. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=379.0s)]
*  Approval in several African countries with a lot of malaria is expected in the coming weeks. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=387.0s)]
*  Jonathan Lambert, NPR News. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=392.0s)]
*  Mounds of trash are piling up in Philadelphia. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=394.0s)]
*  Municipal workers have been on strike for a week now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=397.0s)]
*  The union represents about 9,000 city workers they want better pay. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=400.0s)]
*  Negotiations are supposed to resume today. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=405.0s)]
*  The city has set up temporary drop-off trash sites, but it's having trouble with people dumping all kinds of things. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=408.0s)]
*  I'm Christian Wright and this is NPR News in Washington. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKqI_OoJNzs&t=415.0s)]
