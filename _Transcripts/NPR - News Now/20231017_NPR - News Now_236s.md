# Thousands Attend Funeral For Illinois Boy Allegedly Killed By Landlord | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8)
*  President Biden will meet in Israel and Jordan tomorrow with those countries' leaders. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=0.0s)]
*  And the House may vote today on whether to elect Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan as its next speaker. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=4.7s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=10.1s)]
*  President Biden leaves this afternoon for a short trip to Israel and Jordan, arriving tomorrow. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=14.5s)]
*  He'll meet in person with leaders. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=19.8s)]
*  NPR's Tamara Keith reports Biden wants to hear about Israel's military strategy and its needs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=21.5s)]
*  Normally, when a president visits a war zone, it's done in secrecy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  When Biden went to Ukraine earlier this year, he took a 10-hour train ride to get to Kyiv, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=30.9s)]
*  with virtually no one in the world knowing about it until he was there. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=36.2s)]
*  National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says the situation is different. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=40.0s)]
*  Tel Aviv isn't Kyiv. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=44.6s)]
*  The security situation is certainly tense, of course, but we take all those factors into account [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=46.5s)]
*  when we both plan the president's trip and when we make a decision to preview it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  Polling shows at this moment Americans are very much in favor of showing strong support for Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  And that support for an ally at war is a big part of Biden's agenda with this trip. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=70.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel continues to strike at Hamas and Hezbollah targets in both Gaza and in Lebanon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=72.10000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Jerusalem. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=77.9s)]
*  After an intense 24 hours of continued airstrikes, the Israeli military said it had killed Osama Mazini, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=80.69999999999999s)]
*  a Hamas official responsible for those taken prisoner by Hamas, and who quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=86.6s)]
*  directed terrorist activities against Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=90.8s)]
*  To the north, the IDF announced that it was striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=93.8s)]
*  and later said it had carried out strikes against what it called terror targets [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  and infrastructure of the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=101.6s)]
*  adding that it was in response to Fire Monday toward Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  The IDF chief of staff released a message to soldiers saying in part, quote, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=108.5s)]
*  we took a hard hit and we are responsible, but now the initiative is in our hands. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=112.2s)]
*  The war will be difficult and long, the message continued, but the IDF will prevail. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=116.5s)]
*  Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Jerusalem. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=121.4s)]
*  As Israel continues bombing Gaza, the situation for Palestinians remains desperate. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=123.4s)]
*  Palestinian health officials say the airstrikes have left nearly 2,800 people dead. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=128.6s)]
*  Israel is blocking all water, food and fuel from entering the Palestinian enclave. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  Relief groups in other countries say the situation is catastrophic. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=139.0s)]
*  People in hospitals cannot get medical aid. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=143.0s)]
*  There is fear of disease as people drink dirty water. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=145.6s)]
*  The U.S. is pushing Israel to allow relief aid to enter Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Many people turned out in a Chicago suburb yesterday to mourn a six-year-old boy [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=153.2s)]
*  who was stabbed to death by his landlord. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=158.1s)]
*  Allegedly, Wadiyah al-Faom was Palestinian American. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=160.7s)]
*  Prosecutors allege the landlord targeted him because of his family's Muslim faith. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=164.7s)]
*  Mahmoud Youssef is the boy's great uncle. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=170.0s)]
*  He says the fighting between Israel and Hamas militants should not be reflected here in the U.S. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  You want war? It's overseas. It's not our war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=178.1s)]
*  It's not the United States war. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=180.7s)]
*  And we're gathered here to say we need to save our kids. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=184.1s)]
*  I'm not just saying about Palestinians. I'm saying about our kids. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=189.4s)]
*  The landlord is charged with murder. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=193.9s)]
*  There may be a vote later today in the House to select a new speaker. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  Republicans have the majority and Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan won a GOP leadership contest last week. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=200.1s)]
*  But he did not have near unanimity of GOP support. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=206.9s)]
*  New York Congressman Mark Molinaro says Jordan has won his backing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=210.6s)]
*  He's assured me that members like me and the people I represent will have a voice at the table [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=214.7s)]
*  and he understands that we need to govern and for that I'll be voting for him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=219.4s)]
*  But it's not clear if Jordan has enough support. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=223.4s)]
*  If all members are voting, Jordan can only afford to lose a few Republicans in order to win the Speaker's gavel. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=225.9s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0y15oIfqB8&t=233.4s)]
