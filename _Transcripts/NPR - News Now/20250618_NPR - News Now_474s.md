# Trump Appears Move The U.S. Closer To Conflict With Iran | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk)
*  President Trump appears to be moving the U.S. closer toward conflict with Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=0.0s)]
*  And New York City's controller, and one of the candidates to be the city's next mayor, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=4.7s)]
*  was arrested yesterday outside an immigration court. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=9.1s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=12.1s)]
*  Israeli warplanes have continued to strike Iran overnight, including hitting the capital, Tehran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=16.8s)]
*  An Iranian foreign ministry official is warning against U.S. intervention in this conflict, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  saying it could lead to a wider war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=27.3s)]
*  President Trump is speaking out about the conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=29.8s)]
*  And NPR's Franco Ordoñez reports Trump does not appear to be interested in diplomacy anymore. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=34.0s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=39.900000000000006s)]
*  He's drawn a red line if soldiers are targeted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=42.7s)]
*  But he's also signaling the U.S. is already more involved than the White House previously led on. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=46.0s)]
*  He's boasting that, quote, we now have total complete control of the skies over Iran. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=51.6s)]
*  He's saying we know where the supreme leader is. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  I mean, he's repeatedly using that word, we, blurring the line between Israel's objective and U.S. objectives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=58.5s)]
*  Taking that kind of ownership has really raised more concerns of the U.S. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=65.1s)]
*  getting more involved into another foreign conflict. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=69.2s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordoñez reporting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=71.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are considering adjusting the multi-trillion dollar tax cut [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=74.3s)]
*  and spending bill backed by President Trump. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=79.3s)]
*  But NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports new Senate provisions are setting up a collision course with the House. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=82.0s)]
*  The Senate Finance Committee released the highly anticipated legislative text, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=88.0s)]
*  which addresses programs like Medicaid, clean energy tax credits and other hotly disputed items. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=91.7s)]
*  This comes after the House passed its version of the bill in May after narrowly overcoming internal divisions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=97.2s)]
*  Some of those House members who are at the center of the negotiations have already said the latest text from the Senate [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  crosses their red lines, like not enough of a deduction for state and local taxes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=108.7s)]
*  Some senators are also concerned the Senate language makes too many adjustments to Medicaid. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=114.0s)]
*  Senate Republicans want to pass the bill by July 4th. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=118.9s)]
*  Barbara Sprunt and Peer News, Washington. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=122.2s)]
*  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has released a more detailed analysis of the proposed measure. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=124.4s)]
*  The CBO says it would increase U.S. deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=130.3s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says it fails to take into account how much economic growth the bill creates. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=137.0s)]
*  New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested yesterday outside an immigration court. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=143.6s)]
*  For member station WNYC, Charles Lane reports Lander was detained as immigration officers were trying to take a migrant into custody. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=150.2s)]
*  Video shows Lander being led away in handcuffs by two men who appear to be masked law enforcement officials, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=158.7s)]
*  typical of recent practices by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  Lander, who's running for mayor, said he was escorting a migrant from court and asked to see the person's arrest warrant. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=169.2s)]
*  And they would not show me the warrant. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=175.2s)]
*  And I said I'd let go of his arm as soon as they showed it to me. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=178.0s)]
*  And they did not show it to me. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=181.4s)]
*  And you saw what happened. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=182.9s)]
*  A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal court officer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=185.4s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Charles Lane in New York City. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=193.1s)]
*  In Georgia, the mother of a brain-dead and pregnant woman who was kept on life support tells Atlanta TV station WXIA [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  the woman's baby was delivered prematurely by C-section last Friday. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  She was about six months pregnant. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  The baby is now in intensive care. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=210.6s)]
*  WXIA is reporting the woman was about eight weeks pregnant when she was first declared brain-dead. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=212.89999999999998s)]
*  But her family says Georgia's near total ban on abortion required them to keep her on life support for months. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=218.7s)]
*  Her mother says she was taken off life support yesterday. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=225.6s)]
*  An overnight curfew for downtown Los Angeles has now been lifted. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  It was imposed last week following clashes between authorities and protesters after federal immigration raids. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=233.1s)]
*  Steve Futterman has more. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=240.1s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass, who imposed the curfew, said tensions here in the downtown area have been reduced. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=241.9s)]
*  In a written statement, she said the curfew and other crime prevention efforts have been successful in protecting stores, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=247.7s)]
*  restaurants, businesses and residential areas. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=254.3s)]
*  When the curfew first went into effect, L.A. was enduring nightly confrontations with police at times using non-lethal explosives, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=257.7s)]
*  tear gas and declaring unlawful assemblies. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  Although the nightly protests and confrontations have essentially ended, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=273.90000000000003s)]

*  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is facing another lawsuit, this time for allegedly hiding assets from the Sandy Hook families. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=287.5s)]
*  They won more than a billion dollars in damages for defamation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=294.9s)]
*  NPR's Tovia Smith reports a federal trustee overseeing the settlement calls Jones' financial dealings, quote, textbook fraud. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=299.2s)]
*  Jones has long claimed he didn't have the money to pay the families who sued him after he accused them of faking their children's deaths in 2012. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=307.5s)]
*  Now, the trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case is trying to prove that Jones at least used to have it, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=315.8s)]
*  but tried to hide it by giving it to his father, his ex-wife and his kids' trust. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=320.2s)]
*  The trustee wants the federal bankruptcy court to undo $5 million worth of last-minute sales and transfers of cars, condos, cash and a ranch. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=324.8s)]
*  Lawyers for Jones did not respond to requests for comment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  Chris Maddie, attorney for the families, says it's no surprise Jones would lie to hide his assets, but added, quote, he won't get away with it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=337.90000000000003s)]

*  The major bank, Chase, is hiking its annual fee for a popular credit card to nearly $800. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=347.7s)]
*  And Piers Alina Seljuk reports it applies to a premium card often used by people to collect travel points and rewards. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=354.0s)]

*  And that amount is not increasing, though Chase is promoting various new rewards, including deals with Apple TV, rideshare company Lyft and food delivery service DoorDash. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=380.7s)]

*  They won the Stanley Cup last night, defeating the Edmonton Oilers 5-1 at home. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGmiBkvbyk&t=455.40000000000003s)]
