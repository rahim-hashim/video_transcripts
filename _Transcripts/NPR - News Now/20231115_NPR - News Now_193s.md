# Israeli Troops Enter Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c)
*  Israeli troops have entered Gaza's largest hospital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=0.0s)]
*  They say they're targeting Hamas militants inside. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=3.0s)]
*  And the House of Representatives has passed a short-term spending bill to help avert a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=6.0s)]
*  government shutdown. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=9.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=10.68s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=11.68s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=13.6s)]
*  The Israeli military says its troops have entered the largest hospital complex in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=15.08s)]
*  It says Hamas militants are operating a command center there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=20.2s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Freyer reports medical staff and patients are trapped inside the hospital. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=23.52s)]
*  Israel's military says it's carrying out a precise and targeted operation in a specific [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  area of the El Shifa hospital complex. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=34.04s)]
*  It called on any Hamas fighters inside to surrender. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=36.32s)]
*  From the crowded hospital, the head of its burns unit tells El Jazeera that people are [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  being told to move away from the windows. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=44.12s)]
*  They're panic-stricken, he says. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=46.44s)]
*  Israel accuses Hamas of basing fighters in or under hospitals. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=48.84s)]
*  The U.S. says its intelligence suggests the same. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=52.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, after the United Nations said its fuel depot in Gaza is now empty and that many [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=55.64s)]
*  more people would die as a result, Israeli defense officials now say they will allow [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  fuel into Gaza for the first time since October 7. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=65.4s)]
*  They say it's in response to a request from the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=69.32s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=71.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, the World Health Organization says it has also lost contact with medical staffers [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=74.2s)]
*  inside the Gaza hospital. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=79.68s)]
*  Congress could be on the way to averting a pending government shutdown. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=82.16s)]
*  The Senate is poised to take up a temporary funding measure to push that deadline to early [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=86.16s)]
*  next year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=90.96s)]
*  NPR's Claudia Corsales reports the House approved the plan yesterday in a strong bipartisan [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=91.96s)]
*  vote. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  The Senate will take up the temporary funding measure in the coming days to keep the government [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=98.4s)]
*  open past a shutdown deadline this Friday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=102.44s)]
*  Now that shutdown threat is expected to be moved to two dates early next year. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=105.66s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson crafted the plan with help from hardline Republicans. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=110.76s)]
*  They suggested temporarily funding certain agencies, which will now face a new funding [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=114.76s)]
*  deadline in mid-January and the remainder of agencies facing a February deadline. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=119.36s)]
*  However, conservative Republicans voted against the plan because it did not have deep spending [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=125.36s)]
*  cuts or significant policy plan changes, issues that kept House Democrats on board to support [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=129.86s)]
*  it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=137.16s)]
*  Claudia Corsales, NPR News. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=138.16s)]
*  President Biden is in San Francisco where he will attend a major Asian Pacific Economic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=140.6s)]
*  Forum. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=145.4s)]
*  But NPR's John Ruich tells us the key event today is Biden's meeting with Chinese President [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=146.4s)]
*  Xi Jinping. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=151.6s)]
*  It's an opportunity actually for Biden and Xi to reconnect after quite a long time and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=152.6s)]
*  also, you know, attempt to renew their relationship. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=157.88s)]
*  You know, they've met many times going back to when they were vice presidents. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=160.16s)]
*  The challenge, of course, is that the relationship between China and the U.S. is very contentious, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=164.22s)]
*  right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=168.24s)]
*  The U.S. administration has cast it as fundamentally competitive. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=169.24s)]
*  Xi Jinping himself has explicitly said he thinks the U.S. is out to encircle China. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  NPR's John Ruich reporting. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=177.24s)]
*  It is possible the leaders could agree to resume communication between the U.S. and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=179.36s)]
*  Chinese militaries. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  These communications have been severed for more than a year. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=185.84s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON_uZbOHr7c&t=189.76000000000002s)]
