# Gaetz Calls For Vote To Oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo)
*  Florida Representative Matt Gaetz has called for a vote to oust Kevin McCarthy from his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=0.0s)]
*  role as Speaker, and a federal court will review proposals today for Alabama's new congressional [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=4.86s)]
*  districts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=10.46s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=11.46s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=12.46s)]
*  The Nobel Prize in Physics has gone to three researchers for their work generating ultra-short [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  pulses of light. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=20.34s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brumfield explains. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=21.62s)]
*  The prize went to Pierre Augustini of Ohio State University, Ferenz Krauss of the Max [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Germany, and Anne Luye of Lund University in Sweden [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=28.22s)]
*  for their work developing addosecond light pulses. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=33.4s)]
*  An addosecond is a billionth of a billionth of a second. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=36.84s)]
*  It's a moment in time so brief that these light pulses could be used to glimpse electrons. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=40.06s)]
*  Electrons are the negative particles whizzing around the cores of atoms. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=46.34s)]
*  How they move affects everything from chemical reactions to modern electronics. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  That's why it's called electronics. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=53.42s)]
*  Making electrons even briefly was enough to win these researchers a Nobel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=56.12s)]
*  Jeff Brumfield, NPR News. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is facing a leadership challenge. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=62.82s)]
*  Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz says McCarthy broke promises to hardline House [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=65.64s)]
*  Republicans when he worked with Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=69.96s)]
*  Gaetz insists he's got enough Republican support to topple McCarthy as Speaker without help [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=74.12s)]
*  from Democrats. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=79.2s)]
*  I have made no deal with Democrats because I believe that Democrats should vote against [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=80.2s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy for free. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  It's Kevin McCarthy who's out there offering deals to Democrats. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=86.68s)]
*  So if there's a deal made with Democrats, the only deal is to make one with McCarthy [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=89.98s)]
*  because I'm not offering anything and won't offer anything. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  Other House Republicans have urged Gaetz to drop the challenge. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  McCarthy has told Gaetz to quote, bring it on. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=101.36s)]
*  A federal court hearing is taking place today in Alabama to review proposals for the state's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  new congressional election map. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=108.92s)]
*  As NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports, the hearing is part of a long-running redistricting fight [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=111.2s)]
*  that could help determine which party controls Congress after next year's elections. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=115.92s)]
*  Republicans hold a slim majority in the U.S. House and they may be overtaken by additional [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=120.88s)]
*  Democratic pickups in southern states like Alabama. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=125.0s)]
*  That's where a voting rights lawsuit has put Alabama on track to having two congressional [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=127.92s)]
*  districts where black Alabamians have a realistic chance of electing their preferred candidate. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=131.4s)]
*  The state's Republican-controlled legislature has been pushing for a map with only one such [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=136.12s)]
*  likely violating the Voting Rights Act. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=140.28s)]
*  Because of how racially polarized voting is in Alabama, those two new districts are likely [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=142.6s)]
*  to elect Democrats. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=146.72s)]
*  The exact lines of those districts are expected to be decided by a panel of three federal [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=148.28s)]
*  judges after today's hearing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=154.24s)]
*  Separately, a federal trial is underway in Florida over a redrawn congressional district. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=155.96s)]
*  Lawyers representing black voters allege Florida Governor Ron DeSantis improperly took apart [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=161.12s)]
*  a congressional district where black voters could select their preferred candidate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=166.64s)]
*  Lawyers for DeSantis say the map was redrawn to better reflect natural boundaries instead [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  of race or party. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=176.48s)]
*  Texas Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar was carjacked in Washington, D.C. last night. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  His office says he was not hurt. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  D.C. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  Police say they're looking for three suspects. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVC5Fm0faGo&t=189.92s)]
