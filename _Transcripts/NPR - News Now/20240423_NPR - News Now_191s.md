# Biden Campaigns In Florida Today As State’s 6-Week Abortion Ban Looms | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ)
*  President Biden will be campaigning in Florida today, one week before the state's six-week abortion ban is set to take effect. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And the British Parliament has signed off on a plan to deport migrants to Rwanda. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kristin Wright with NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Today is day two of the criminal hush money trial of former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=16.0s)]
*  The former publisher of the National Enquirer is expected to return to the witness stand. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=21.0s)]
*  The judge will also hear arguments on whether Trump violated a court gag order that prohibits him from publicly attacking witnesses. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=26.0s)]
*  The judge will decide if Trump should be held in contempt over a series of truth social posts. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=35.0s)]
*  President Biden campaigns in Florida today, one week before the state's new six-week abortion ban is set to take effect. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=42.0s)]
*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports now, a Democratic presidential candidate hasn't won the state since 2012. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=51.0s)]
*  The Biden campaign says it is competing there this year, buoyed by the fact that a reproductive rights referendum will be on the ballot in November. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=58.0s)]
*  Campaign communications director Michael Tyler says the entire purpose of today's trip is... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=66.0s)]
*  Forcefully advocate for reproductive freedom and call out Donald Trump's abortion bans, as he's been doing since Roe was overturned. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=72.0s)]
*  It's going to stand in stark contrast to Trump, who when he's out on the stump, every single day is bragging about the role that he played in overturning Roe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=80.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump does often speak proudly about naming three Supreme Court justices who made the majority on the court that overturned Roe v. Wade. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=88.0s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=98.0s)]
*  The Senate could vote as soon as today on a foreign aid package providing assistance to Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and other allies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=100.0s)]
*  The funding includes $61 billion to Kiev to support its defense against Russia's invasion and $26 billion to Israel and humanitarian aid for Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=109.0s)]
*  The package also includes a measure that could trigger a nationwide TikTok ban. President Biden says he would sign it into law if it clears the Senate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=119.0s)]
*  Coast Guard officials say at least five people, including a child, have drowned trying to cross the English Channel from France to England. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=127.0s)]
*  The deaths come just hours after the U.K. Parliament passed a controversial plan to deport to Rwanda migrants who make that channel journey. NPR's Lauren Freyer reports. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=136.0s)]
*  U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sonak says the threat of deportation to Rwanda in Central Africa will deter migrants from risking their lives to enter the U.K. illegally. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=146.0s)]
*  His landmark immigration policy faced two years of debate, votes and legal challenges before passing parliament after midnight. Sonak says flights will take off in 10 to 12 weeks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=156.0s)]
*  No ifs, no buts. These flights are going to Rwanda. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=167.0s)]
*  But Sonak's government has yet to find an airline willing to participate. Human rights groups question whether the U.K. can legally outsource its asylum system to Rwanda. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=171.0s)]
*  And they also question whether that country will treat migrants fairly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=181.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, London. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=184.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY-1zoqdKCQ&t=187.0s)]
