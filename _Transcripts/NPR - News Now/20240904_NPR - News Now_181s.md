# Pressure On Netanyahu Grows To Agree To A Cease-Fire | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI)
*  Live from NPR News, I'm Korva Coleman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=0.0s)]
*  The Justice Department has announced terrorism charges against six leaders of Hamas. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=3.9s)]
*  That includes the group's political chief, Yaya Sinwar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=8.74s)]
*  Three of the defendants are dead. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=11.84s)]
*  The other three face several charges, including conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=13.32s)]
*  U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland says one American was just killed by Hamas. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=18.04s)]
*  This weekend, we learned that Hamas murdered six more hostages, including Hirsch, Goldberg, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=23.88s)]
*  and Colin, a 23-year-old Israeli American. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=29.72s)]
*  We are investigating Hirsch's murder and each and every one of the brutal murders of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=33.68s)]
*  Americans as acts of terrorism. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=38.78s)]
*  Court papers say Hamas killed at least 43 Americans in the October 7th attack on Israel [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=41.32s)]
*  and took at least 10 Americans hostage. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=46.96s)]
*  Pressure is growing inside Israel, demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu make [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=50.28s)]
*  a ceasefire with Hamas. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  There have been days of protests since news that Hamas killed six hostages. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=56.64s)]
*  They were slain just as the Israeli troops were approaching the part of Gaza where they [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=61.24s)]
*  were held. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=65.16s)]
*  And Piers Hadil Al-Shalchi reports critics include one of Israel's leading political [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=66.38s)]
*  figures. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=71.2s)]
*  Former general and emergency war cabinet member Benny Gantz called on Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=72.2s)]
*  to quit if he can't reach a ceasefire deal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=77.08s)]
*  In a speech Tuesday, Gantz told Netanyahu to quote, hand over the keys and go home. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=80.28s)]
*  He also said Netanyahu has lost his way and sees himself as a state, which is dangerous. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=85.42s)]
*  Gantz doesn't have enough influence to sway Netanyahu, but his voice adds to the growing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=90.54s)]
*  pressure from inside Israel for the Prime Minister to accept a deal and eventually end [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  the war in Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=99.18s)]
*  A major sticking point in the negotiations is the Israeli military presence on the Gaza-Egyptian [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=100.58s)]
*  border. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=105.3s)]
*  Hamas wants a complete withdrawal, something Netanyahu is adamant not to do. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=106.3s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shalchi, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=110.62s)]
*  New York Governor Kathy Hochul is expressing outrage at the alleged behavior of one of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=113.26s)]
*  her former aides. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=118.34s)]
*  Hochul's former deputy chief of staff is accused of acting as an agent for the Chinese [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=124.9s)]
*  From member station WNYC, John Campbell reports. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  Linda Sun spent more than 10 years in New York state government, the last two with Governor [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=130.1s)]
*  Hochul's administration. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=134.94s)]
*  Federal prosecutors say she used her position to push the Chinese government's views, including [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=136.66s)]
*  by keeping the governor from interacting with Taiwanese officials. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=141.46s)]
*  Hochul told WNYC she fired the aide last year after uncovering evidence of misconduct. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=145.1s)]
*  I'm furious and I'm outraged and absolutely shocked at how brazen her behavior was. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=150.3s)]
*  It was a betrayal of trust. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=155.86s)]
*  Sun and her husband are accused of leaning on people with ties to the Chinese government [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=157.82s)]
*  for assistance. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=161.56s)]
*  They helped her husband's business export lobsters to China, which brought in millions [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=162.88s)]
*  The couple allegedly used to buy a Ferrari and expensive homes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=167.77999999999997s)]
*  The couple has pleaded not guilty. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=172.1s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm John Campbell in Albany. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49ezAAqbAI&t=174.22s)]
