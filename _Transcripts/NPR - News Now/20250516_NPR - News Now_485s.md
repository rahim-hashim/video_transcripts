# Cassie Ventura's Cross-Examination Continues In Sean Combs' Trial | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q)
*  The Department of Homeland Security is asking the Pentagon for help in removing migrants [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=0.0s)]
*  illegally in the U.S. from the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=5.22s)]
*  And Oklahoma's new academic standards will require students to be able to identify, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=8.16s)]
*  discrepancies in the 2020 election results. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=13.6s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=17.52s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=18.52s)]
*  President Trump is completing his Mideast trip today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=22.44s)]
*  He spent the past week meeting with Gulf Arab leaders and striking multibillion-dollar defense [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=24.44s)]
*  and tech deals. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=29.16s)]
*  But NPR's Ea Batraoui reports Trump leaves the region with the war in Gaza still flaring. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=30.16s)]
*  Trump's Mideast visit began just after Hamas released the last living American-Israeli [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=35.92s)]
*  hostage held in Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=40.24s)]
*  Hamas says it did so on the understanding the U.S. would call for a permanent ceasefire [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=41.96s)]
*  and push for aid to enter Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=46.16s)]
*  Instead, while in the region, Trump appeared to double down on his idea that Palestinians [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=48.2s)]
*  in Gaza should be permanently relocated outside the territory, saying the U.S. should get [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=52.32s)]
*  involved there and make it a, quote, freedom zone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=56.32s)]
*  He then said his administration's looking at people starving in Gaza under Israel's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=59.0s)]
*  total blockade, saying, we've got to get that taken care of without elaborating. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=62.7s)]
*  His comments come as Israel says it struck more than 100 Hamas sites in recent days [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=67.16s)]
*  and attacks that have killed hundreds, including entire families. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=71.36s)]
*  Ea Batraoui, NPR News, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=74.88s)]
*  Representatives from Ukraine and Russia are in Istanbul, Turkey. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=78.28s)]
*  They're supposed to be holding direct negotiations about ending Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Expectations for success are low after Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=85.72s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in Turkey, but he's not at these talks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=90.92s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio is there, and Piers Michelle Kellerman reports he's sounding [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=95.4s)]
*  pessimistic about the negotiations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=100.52s)]
*  Secretary Rubio says President Trump is impatient and wants the war to end, but the Kremlin [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  balked at the idea of high-level talks with Ukraine, so now Rubio is talking about a one-on-one [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=108.06s)]
*  between Presidents Trump and Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=114.32s)]
*  I think he's ready to have that engagement and determine once and for all if there's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=117.08s)]
*  a path forward and what that path is. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=121.28s)]
*  And it's my assessment that I don't think we're going to have a breakthrough here until [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  the President and President Putin interact directly on this topic. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=127.38s)]
*  Rubio sounded disappointed that the Russians sent a low-level team to Turkey, so he doesn't [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=132.12s)]
*  expect much to come out of the talks in Istanbul. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=137.44s)]
*  Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, the State Department. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=140.6s)]
*  The star witness in the federal sex trafficking trial against rapper Sean Diddy Combs may [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=144.48s)]
*  return to the stand today. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=149.28s)]
*  Cassie Ventura has been cross-examined by Combs' defense team, as NPR's Isabella Gomez [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  Sarmiento reports. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=156.16s)]
*  A note, this report contains description of sexual activity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  For two days, Cassie Ventura testified about the violence and control that she says dominated [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=162.28s)]
*  her relationship with Sean Combs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=167.48s)]
*  This allegedly included forcing Ventura into drug-fueled, highly orchestrated sexual performances [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=169.96s)]
*  with male escorts. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=175.84s)]
*  Combs faces charges that include sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  His defense says he did not commit these crimes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  In cross-examination of Ventura, the defense relied heavily on text messages she exchanged [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=185.32s)]
*  with Combs over the years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=190.24s)]
*  Ventura read out messages in which she agreed to or planned logistics for those sexual encounters. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=192.28s)]
*  The defense is trying to suggest that she willingly consented to the sexual activity. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=197.76s)]
*  Isabella Gomez Sarmiento, NPR News. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security is asking the Pentagon to provide some 20,000 National [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Guard troops to help in removing migrants illegally in the U.S. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=209.94s)]
*  The New York Times was the first to report the story. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Tom Bowman reports military lawyers are reviewing the request. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=217.04s)]
*  There's no sense at this point what role the Guard troops would play. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=221.48s)]
*  It might be providing transportation or security or if they would be detaining migrants or [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=225.18s)]
*  actually maybe taking part in arrests. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=230.66s)]
*  This would be the first time Guard troops at the national level have been asked to assist [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  in deportations. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=238.18s)]
*  NPR's Tom Bowman reporting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=239.18s)]
*  Air traffic controllers at another airport have experienced a communications blackout [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=241.82s)]
*  for well over a minute, this time in Colorado. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=246.5s)]
*  NPR's Jacqueline Diaz reports this comes on the heels of several outages at newer [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=250.18s)]
*  Caliberty International Airport in New Jersey. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=254.9s)]
*  Multiple radio transmitter failures left pilots flying into Denver International Airport on [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=258.5s)]
*  Monday unable to communicate with air traffic controllers. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=262.94s)]
*  The outage lasted for about two minutes, hitting the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=266.66s)]
*  in Longmont, Colorado. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=270.98s)]
*  That's according to Frank McIntosh, an official with the Federal Aviation Administration, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=273.9s)]
*  who shared the details in testimony before a House committee hearing this week. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  Several reports in Denver claimed the outage lasted for six minutes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=282.78s)]
*  McIntosh said those reports were quote, over-exaggerated. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=287.14s)]
*  Planes were able to remain at safe distances in the sky during the outage. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=291.78s)]
*  Jacqueline Diaz, NPR News. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=296.38s)]
*  Floride will soon be banned in Florida's public water systems under a bill signed into law [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=304.26s)]
*  For member station WUSF, Douglas Soll has more. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=305.26s)]
*  Senator DeSantis says the restriction allows Floridians to choose whether they use fluoride. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=309.46s)]
*  Yes, use fluoride for your teeth, that's fine, but forcing it into the water supply is basically [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  forced medication. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=319.52s)]
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has concerns that ingesting [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=321.29999999999995s)]
*  fluoride can cause health problems. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  But dental groups are adamant that low levels of the mineral only have health positives, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=327.97999999999996s)]
*  preventing cavities, especially for those without regular access to care. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  Florida's ban begins on July 1st. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=336.94s)]
*  A similar law in Utah, the first state to target fluoride, took effect earlier this [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=338.78s)]
*  month. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=343.14s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Douglas Soll in Tallahassee. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=344.14s)]
*  There are new academic standards in Oklahoma. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=347.5s)]
*  These require Oklahoma students to identify quote, discrepancies in the 2020 election [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=349.9s)]
*  results. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=356.58s)]
*  Beth Wallace reports the policy is going into effect, although there were no major discrepancies [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=357.58s)]
*  substantiated in the 2020 presidential election. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=362.85999999999996s)]
*  The standards have been championed by Ryan Walters, Oklahoma State Superintendent of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=366.78s)]
*  Public Instruction and a conservative firebrand. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=371.21999999999997s)]
*  These new standards will ensure that kids have an accurate and comprehensive view of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  historical events while also reinforcing the values that make our country great. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=377.85999999999996s)]
*  While Republican leadership raised concerns about a rushed procedure to get the standards [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=382.73999999999995s)]
*  through the State Board of Education, the content of the standards has gotten little [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=387.17999999999995s)]
*  pushback from the majority party. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=391.94s)]
*  A lawsuit filed by a former GOP Oklahoma attorney general could stall the implementation of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  the standards, which are set to take effect next school year. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=400.02s)]
*  But like other Republican criticisms, the lawsuit takes issue with how the standards [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=403.65999999999997s)]
*  were approved, not the standards themselves. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=408.26s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Beth Wallace. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjOkuSMF9Q&t=411.73999999999995s)]
