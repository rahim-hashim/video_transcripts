*  Khamenei will have to wait whether he wants to risk entering into a broad regional war [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X2p7TaNeT0&t=122.84s)]
*  with Israel, which undoubtedly would pull in the U.S., or wait and perhaps bide his [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X2p7TaNeT0&t=127.6s)]
