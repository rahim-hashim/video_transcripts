# Harris Secures Support To Be The Democrats' Nominee | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, July 23rd. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=2.84s)]
*  and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=4.84s)]
*  The Associated Press says that Vice President Harris [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=6.84s)]
*  has secured enough pledges from Democratic Convention [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=9.38s)]
*  party delegates that she should be able to win [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=12.18s)]
*  the party's presidential nomination. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=14.68s)]
*  Democratic officials are expected to hold [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=17.02s)]
*  an electronic roll call vote of delegates [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=19.22s)]
*  within about two weeks, well before next month's convention. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=21.76s)]
*  Harris spoke to campaign staffers [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  in Wilmington, Delaware yesterday [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=27.6s)]
*  about the next steps in a very short campaign season. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=29.8s)]
*  So in the next 106 days, we have work to do. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=34.04s)]
*  We have doors to knock on. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=38.64s)]
*  We have people to talk to. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=40.8s)]
*  We have phone calls to make. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=42.58s)]
*  And we have an election to win. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Democrats may also face a legal challenge from Republicans. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=46.64s)]
*  It's unclear if Harris can draw on campaign money [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=50.88s)]
*  that was raised when Biden was on the ticket. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=53.86s)]
*  But Harris has always been on the Democratic ticket, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  and other election law experts suggest [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=60.1s)]
*  there should not be a problem for her [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=62.6s)]
*  to tap the campaign funding. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=64.36s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=66.9s)]
*  is in Washington for a three-day visit. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=69.14s)]
*  Tomorrow, he is scheduled to address [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  a joint meeting of Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=73.5s)]
*  The Israeli leader will meet Vice President Harris [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  later this week, and NPR's Jackie Northam reports [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=78.12s)]
*  he's also expected to sit down with President Biden. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=81.54s)]
*  This is Netanyahu's first time out of Israel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=84.78s)]
*  since the start of the war in Gaza in October, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=87.24s)]
*  but he'll be greeted in Washington [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  with many of the same divisions and anger [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=91.78s)]
*  over the conflict that he left back home. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=94.32s)]
*  Netanyahu has been facing increased pressure [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=96.96s)]
*  by the Biden administration to reach a ceasefire deal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=99.42s)]
*  to end the war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=102.5s)]
*  Some relatives of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=103.86s)]
*  as well as Israeli soldiers, are also traveling to Washington [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=106.94s)]
*  to take part in protests over Netanyahu's handling of the war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=110.6s)]
*  Police in Washington are preparing for thousands [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=115.56s)]
*  of demonstrators to fill the streets [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=117.9s)]
*  around the Capitol Wednesday [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=119.6s)]
*  ahead of Netanyahu's speech to Congress. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=121.2s)]
*  Jackie Northam, NPR News. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=124.1s)]
*  Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=126.58s)]
*  testified before the House Oversight Committee yesterday. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=128.84s)]
*  Lawmakers grilled her for nearly five hours [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=132.14s)]
*  about the attempted assassination [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=134.98s)]
*  of former President Donald Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=136.76s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas has more. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=138.96s)]
*  In her testimony, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheadle [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=141.16s)]
*  The assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=144.46s)]
*  on July 13th is the most significant operational failure [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=146.96s)]
*  of the Secret Service in decades. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  But lawmakers grew frustrated [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=153.94s)]
*  with the lack of answers from Cheadle, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=155.4s)]
*  including about how the gunman was able to get up on a roof [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=157.04s)]
*  with a clear line of sight on Trump. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=159.64s)]

*  They deserve answers. Congress deserves answers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=165.64s)]
*  You were subpoenaed today to provide answers, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=168.82s)]
*  and ma'am, you did not do that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=172.24s)]
*  Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=174.18s)]
*  ramped up their calls for her to step down. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=175.82s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW7iUHxMWg8&t=178.02s)]
