# Candidates Spar Over The Economy, Abortion In Milwaukee Debate | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk)
*  Former president Donald Trump is expected to turn himself in to authorities in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=0.0s)]
*  Georgia today. And on Maui, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=3.68s)]
*  a high school in Lahaina is fully reopening today. Good morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=5.46s)]
*  I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=10.0s)]
*  Former president Donald Trump is expected to turn himself in to the Fulton County [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=14.32s)]
*  jail later today. Georgia public broadcasting, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=18.82s)]
*  Stephen Fowler reports Trump faces 13 felony counts for an alleged [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=22.42s)]
*  effort to overturn Georgia's 2020 election. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=27.2s)]
*  In some ways Trump will be like every other defendant who stepped foot into the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=31.08s)]
*  Fulton County jail. He'll be formally arrested, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=34.46s)]
*  fingerprinted and processed after being charged last week. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=37.0s)]
*  But the former president who is under secret service protection also was expected [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=40.2s)]
*  to have a booking photo taken, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=44.16s)]
*  the first one in the four different indictments he's received in the last few [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=45.8s)]
*  months. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=48.96s)]
*  After upstaging the GOP presidential debate last night by refusing to attend, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=49.94s)]
*  Trump's visit to Atlanta is expected to dominate headlines again with his [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  arrival expected to coincide with the evening prime time television viewing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=57.86s)]
*  hours. For NPR News, I'm Stephen Fowler in Atlanta. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=61.4s)]
*  One high school fully reopens today in the Maui town of Lahaina where at least [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=65.18s)]
*  115 people died in a wildfire earlier this month. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=69.6s)]
*  Meanwhile NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports more places are offering temporary [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  housing to survivors. In addition to hotels, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=78.34s)]
*  the county says landlords and property owners across the state have stepped up. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=81.56s)]
*  They've offered 900 houses, apartments or rooms for wildfire survivors [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=85.92s)]
*  to rent. A new Maui bus route also starts Thursday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=90.92s)]
*  It will take evacuees between hotels and a shopping mall. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=94.48s)]
*  A lot of people lost their cars in the fire and they have found travel difficult. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Jennifer Ludden reporting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=101.72s)]
*  Schools across the country are leaving millions, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  perhaps billions of federal dollars on the table. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  That's money that could help tens of millions of children, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=110.08s)]
*  including kids with disabilities. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  Emily Harris reports on the findings of a new NPR investigation. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  The money comes from Medicaid, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=119.2s)]
*  which covers many health needs for students with disabilities and students from [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=120.72s)]
*  low income families. Last year, schools got a total of $6.6 billion. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=124.5s)]
*  Medicaid officials say they could be getting much more, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=130.16s)]
*  but many schools say the reimbursement process has been too cumbersome to be [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  worthwhile. Now Medicaid has simplified things. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=136.84s)]
*  Deputy Administrator Dan Tsai hopes this will get more money into schools. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  You're talking about things on the order of magnitude of billions. First though, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=144.12s)]
*  states have to update their Medicaid policies. So far, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=148.12s)]
*  at least 22 states have at least partially done so. For NPR News, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm Emily Harris. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  The head of the Wagner mercenary group, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=157.16s)]
*  Zyavdany Purgosian's name was found on the passenger list of a plane that crashed [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=159.2s)]
*  with no survivors north of Moscow, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=163.88s)]
*  but there is no confirmation that he is dead. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=165.88s)]
*  Russian state media says 10 bodies were recovered this just months after [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=168.72s)]
*  Purgosian launched a mutiny against Russia's military leadership. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin relies on the Wagner group to supplement Russian troops [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  in his war against Ukraine. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=181.76s)]
*  Republican presidential hopefuls gathered in Milwaukee for the first Republican [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=184.2s)]
*  presidential primary debate carried by the Fox News channel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=188.68s)]
*  They sparred over a number of issues, including the economy, abortion, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=192.48s)]
*  and former president Donald Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=196.68s)]
*  election. NPR's Sarah McCammon has more. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=200.96s)]
*  Trump refused to attend the debate saying his solid lead in primary polls made [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=204.16s)]
*  his participation unnecessary. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=208.28s)]
*  Moderators asked the candidates to weigh in on indictments he's facing in four [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=210.52s)]
*  jurisdictions and his actions leading up to the January 6th insurrection. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=214.28s)]
*  Former vice president Mike Pence said in a debate on the Fox News channel, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=218.84s)]
*  he would support Trump if he's the Republican nominee, even if he's convicted. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=222.56s)]
*  But Pence said he could not support Trump's request on January 6th. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=227.08s)]
*  He asked me to put him over the constitution and I chose the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=230.72s)]
*  constitution and I always will. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=234.96s)]
*  Eight Republicans met the criteria to participate in the Milwaukee debate, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  which includes signing a pledge to support the eventual nominee. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=241.12s)]
*  The city also will host the GOP convention next summer. Sarah McCammon, NPR News, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjbStnLkBk&t=244.64000000000001s)]
