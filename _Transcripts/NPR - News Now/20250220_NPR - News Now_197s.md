**NPR - News Now:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y)
*  European leaders have expressed anger and dismay after President Trump's latest comments on the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And Hamas has released four hostages' bodies, including those belonging to a young mother and her two young children. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=6.24s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=12.88s)]
*  European leaders have expressed anger and dismay after President Trump labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Zelensky says Trump appears to be amplifying Russian disinformation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=24.44s)]
*  This comes as the U.S. and Russia held high-level negotiations this week about ending the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=28.8s)]
*  Zelensky was not invited to the talks, nor were any European leaders. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=34.76s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ortonius says that European leaders are now reaching out to Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=39.28s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron will be in Washington next week to meet with Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=44.0s)]
*  Also, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is also expected to visit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=48.16s)]
*  Now, like many leaders, Macron and others are concerned about Europe not being part of these negotiations with Russia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=52.76s)]
*  The big worry across Europe is that even if a deal is reached, it won't be lasting, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=59.2s)]
*  and that Russia will likely invade again and possibly another European nation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=64.28s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ortonius reporting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the U.S. military to identify $50 billion in cuts for next year. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=71.56s)]
*  NPR's Rylan Barton reports the order comes as the Pentagon braces for layoffs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=79.2s)]
*  The cuts would shift funding to Trump's priorities, which include securing the country's borders, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=84.08s)]
*  building a so-called Iron Dome for America missile defense system, and ending, quote, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=88.2s)]
*  radical and wasteful government DEI programs. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  That's according to a statement from Pentagon spokesman Robert Solisis. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=95.88s)]
*  The cuts amount to about 8 percent of the Defense Department's $850 billion budget. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=99.36s)]
*  The move could rankle congressional Republicans, who have been pushing for increases in defense spending [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=104.47999999999999s)]

*  to Elon Musk's Doge service. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=114.6s)]
*  It's part of the wave of firings that's already affected thousands of federal workers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=116.96s)]
*  Rylan Barton, NPR News. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=121.16s)]
*  The Defense Secretary has ordered an end to all agency celebrations linked with Identity Months, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=122.88s)]
*  such as Black History Month, ongoing now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=128.12s)]
*  The Trump administration is rooting out DEI programs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=130.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump himself will host a reception at the White House today, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=134.44000000000003s)]

*  The Palestinian militant group Hamas returned the bodies of four Israeli hostages today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=141.12s)]
*  They include three members of the Bebas family, who became a symbol across Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=146.44000000000003s)]
*  NPR's Hadil El-Shilchi reports. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  A large crowd of Palestinians gathered at a ceremony in the city of Khan Younis, south of Gaza, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  to watch the four coffins transferred to the International Committee of the Red Cross. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=158.36s)]
*  NPR's Gaza producer Enes Baba was at the scene. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=163.52s)]
*  The stage was like a theater, closed with black curtains, and behind there was two missiles [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=166.4s)]
*  and four coffins. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=174.0s)]
*  There was a picture or portrait of Netanyahu himself with blood all over his face and with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=175.4s)]
*  his own teeth. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=180.84s)]
*  That's like a vampire. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=181.84s)]
*  Israeli officials confirmed they had received the coffins of the dead Israelis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=183.4s)]
*  They said the bodies would undergo forensic testing to confirm the identities. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GI69Rvq-4Y&t=187.07999999999998s)]
