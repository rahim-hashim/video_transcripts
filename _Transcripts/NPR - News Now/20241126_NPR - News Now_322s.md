**NPR - News Now:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE)
*  Officials in Canada, China and Mexico are expressing alarm at President-elect Donald Trump's plan for new tariffs on products imported from their countries. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=0.0s)]
*  And tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Pakistan this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=9.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=14.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose 25 percent tariffs on all goods entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico on the day he's sworn in. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=18.0s)]
*  He says that's to stop the flow of undocumented migrants and illegal drugs into the U.S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=27.0s)]
*  There's reaction to this news coming from Canada. Dan Karpanchuk reports the premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, says these tariffs would be devastating. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=31.0s)]
*  Ford's comment came less than an hour after Trump suggested that he would be signing an executive order to implement the tariffs on this first day in office. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=40.0s)]
*  Ford says a 25 percent tariff would be, quote, devastating to workers and jobs in both Canada and the U.S., adding that Ottawa needs to establish a Team Canada approach and response. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=47.0s)]
*  Ford says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau must call a meeting of all the provincial premiers as soon as possible. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=58.0s)]
*  Trump has said the tariffs would remain until Canada and Mexico stop drugs and migrants from crossing the border illegally. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=63.0s)]
*  The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has said that even a 10 percent tariff on Canadian goods would seriously impact the 30 billion dollars a year in exports to the U.S., resulting in a major hit to the Canadian economy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=71.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Dan Karpanchuk in Toronto. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=82.0s)]
*  A Chinese spokesperson rejects the allegations that China lets fentanyl precursors into the U.S. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=85.0s)]
*  NPR's Emily Fang says the spokesperson also defended trade ties with the U.S. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=90.0s)]
*  The proposal caused a stir in China, prompting its spokesperson in the U.S. to say the allegations, quote, run counter to facts and to reality. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=95.0s)]
*  The spokesperson, Liu Pengyu, warned, quote, no one will win a trade war or a tariff war. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=103.0s)]
*  During his first presidential term, Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50 percent on more than 300 billion dollars worth of goods in order to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with China. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=108.0s)]
*  China, in turn, slapped its own tariffs on U.S. goods, tariffs some economists say cost U.S. maintenance. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=118.0s)]
*  And it cost U.S. manufacturing jobs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=124.0s)]
*  NPR's Emily Fang reporting. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=126.0s)]

*  NPR's Franco Ardonez explains. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=132.0s)]
*  Congress has the power of the purse. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=134.0s)]
*  It decides how money should be spent. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=136.0s)]
*  Impoundment is when the president kind of holds back money that Congress has approved for a specific purpose. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYKiAi2hPEE&t=139.0s)]
