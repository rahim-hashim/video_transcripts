**NPR - News Now:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0)
*  Health officials report patients are dying at Gaza's two main hospitals due to a lack of power, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=0.0s)]
*  and Congress is facing a late Friday deadline to avoid a partial federal government shutdown. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=10.8s)]
*  Health officials say the two largest hospitals in Gaza have ceased to function. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  The head of the World Health Organization says patient deaths are rising significantly at the biggest one, Al-Shifa. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=19.6s)]
*  Some of the vulnerable patients are premature babies who were on ventilators. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=25.6s)]
*  Israel is blocking fuel imports into Gaza. There's no power to the hospitals. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=29.6s)]
*  One of the facility's doctors, Marwan Abu Sada, says the babies should be moved to safety. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=34.0s)]
*  I'm afraid that we are going to lose all of these babies. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=39.6s)]
*  We are afraid that we would like to move these babies outside Gaza to Egypt to keep them alive, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  because if we leave them in this situation here in Gaza, I think we will lose them all. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=50.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says it's battling Hamas fighters around the hospital. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=55.2s)]
*  Israel's prime minister says Hamas is blocking Palestinians who want to evacuate. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=59.2s)]
*  Israel also claims Hamas uses hospitals to hide their underground tunnels. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=64.0s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson has laid out a short-term spending plan [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=68.8s)]
*  to avert a partial federal government shutdown this coming weekend. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=72.4s)]
*  He wants to split it up so that spending will lapse for some federal agencies by one date, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=76.4s)]
*  and funding for other agencies will end on a different date. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=82.0s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports Democrats and some Republicans don't like it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=85.6s)]
*  Lawmakers are once again scrambling to avert a shutdown. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=90.0s)]

*  says he expects the partisan bickering to come down to the wire. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  In some ways, the only thing that moves action in Washington these days is external forces, right? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Is the impending government shutdown and the loss of certain benefits and the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=109.52s)]
*  people losing paychecks and things like that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=114.16s)]
*  The stopgap bill would fund certain federal agencies through mid-January and others until [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=116.16s)]
*  early February. The White House calls the proposal a quote, recipe for more Republican chaos and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=122.39999999999999s)]

*  appearance on Fox News. Senator Tim Scott says running for president has been one of the most [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=144.48s)]
*  fantastic experiences of his life. But in an interview with former South Carolina Congressman [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=149.52s)]
*  Trey Gowdy on Fox News, Scott said voters were sending him a clear message about his candidacy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=155.04s)]
*  But when I go back to Iowa, it will not be as a presidential candidate. I am suspending my campaign. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=160.8s)]
*  Scott is the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate and he's tailored his message to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=168.48s)]
*  conservative Christian voters. His departure could create more space in the GOP primary for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=173.04s)]
*  other candidates, particularly former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is also from South Carolina. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9oKlf_TJG0&t=178.64s)]
