*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=11.0s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=12.0s)]

*  fuel and food directly to Tal Al Hawa Hospital in northern Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=32.96s)]
*  It says the four-metre ton shipment is equipped with GPS so that officials can track exactly [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=38.22s)]
*  where it's distributed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  The United Nations says Israeli restrictions, fighting and a breakdown of order on the ground [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=45.28s)]

*  In addition to its own aid, Jordan is helping to deliver about $1.3 million of UK aid to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=68.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, London. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=69.0s)]
*  House Republicans are continuing their impeachment probe into the president despite new criminal [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=71.08s)]
*  charges against a central witness in the case. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  He's accused by prosecutors of lying about the claims at the heart of the inquiry. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=78.26s)]
*  NPR's Eric McDaniel reports President Biden's brother, James, spoke behind closed doors [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=83.24000000000001s)]

*  foreign business dealings. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=93.76s)]
*  It's why Republicans called his brother James to appear before them, though he said repeatedly [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=95.28s)]
*  that the now president has not been involved at all. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=98.92s)]

*  witness. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=105.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, it is what it is, so it doesn't change the fundamental facts. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=106.84s)]
*  House Republicans are eager to set up a contrast with GOP frontrunner, former President Donald [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=110.58s)]
*  Trump, who's facing more than 90 criminal charges ahead of a general election. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=114.82s)]
*  But it remains to be seen whether Republicans have the near unanimous support within the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=118.78s)]
*  caucus that they need to impeach Joe Biden. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=122.9s)]

*  The robotic spacecraft called Odysseus is orbiting just a few miles above the lunar [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=136.94s)]
*  surface. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=141.34s)]
*  It was built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines as part of a NASA program to encourage private [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=142.34s)]
*  spaceflight to the moon. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Later today, Odysseus will slowly descend to a crater near the lunar south pole. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=149.14s)]
*  Things have gone smoothly so far, but a smooth landing is far from assured. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2NhKJdFLiA&t=154.5s)]
