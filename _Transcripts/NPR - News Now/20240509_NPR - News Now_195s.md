*  ground invasion of Rafa. And a Republican-led House committee questioned three public school [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=5.36s)]
*  leaders over anti-Semitism in their districts. Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=10.16s)]

*  Israel if it proceeds with a major ground assault on Rafa. That's the southern Gaza city where about [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=20.0s)]
*  half the territory's population is now sheltering. Israeli tanks have moved into the city's outskirts, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=25.52s)]
*  and Israeli officials are urging Palestinians to leave parts of Rafa. But farther north, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  there's also been heavy Israeli bombardment, as NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=36.56s)]
*  Grainy black and white video released by Israel's military shows an explosion enveloping a whole city [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=41.92s)]
*  block. The military says its warplanes struck 25 targets, including tunnels and sniper posts in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=47.68s)]
*  central Gaza. The UN says tens of thousands of Palestinians are leaving Rafa in the south, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=54.4s)]
*  but that the places where they're going may also be under bombardment and lack essential infrastructure. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=60.0s)]
*  It says that with Israeli tanks controlling the Rafa crossing with Egypt, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=66.32s)]
*  no fuel has entered the territory, and that existing stocks will be depleted within days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=70.56s)]
*  Lauren Freyer and PR News Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is also warning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=76.08s)]

*  districts testified. All three have been in the spotlight for students and in some cases staff [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=98.72s)]
*  saying or doing things that could be considered anti-Semitic. From the get-go, though, these [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=104.56s)]
*  district leaders acknowledge these incidents are happening, but they denied that they are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=109.84s)]
*  unchecked or pervasive. And in fact, at one point, David Banks, who heads the New York City schools, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  actually warned lawmakers of casting aspersions on an entire system. After all, he said some members [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=121.04s)]
*  of Congress have made anti-Semitic statements. NPR's Cory Turner reporting. The former interpreter [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=127.2s)]
*  for the Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Otani says he will plead guilty. He's admitting to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErDVFlawZ7k&t=133.44s)]
