# Investigation Into Baltimore Bridge Collapse Continues | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU)
*  Investigators boarded the ship that struck Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge for the first time yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal appeals court says any undated mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania should not be counted. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=6.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=12.9s)]
*  Federal investigators are laying out a timeline of what happened before a cargo ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge on Tuesday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  It was near the port of Baltimore. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports investigators were able to board the ship for the first time yesterday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=26.8s)]
*  Investigators say they've recovered the voyage data recorder from the ship, which is still tangled in the wreckage of the bridge, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=31.9s)]
*  and have reviewed about six hours of audio and data from the night of the incident. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=38.3s)]
*  The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jennifer Homendy, says the ship was carrying more than 760 tons of hazardous materials, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=42.4s)]
*  mostly corrosives and flammable materials, as well as lithium-ion batteries. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=50.1s)]
*  Homendy says some of those containers had been breached in the ship, but Coast Guard officials say they are not aware of any release of hazardous materials, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=54.6s)]
*  and that there is currently no threat to the public. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=61.9s)]
*  Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=64.7s)]
*  Israel's prime minister has changed his mind and will allow a delegation to visit Washington. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=66.6s)]
*  The delegation will meet with Biden administration officials to discuss potential Israeli military operations in the southern Gaza city of Ra'a. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=72.0s)]
*  White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=80.7s)]
*  The prime minister's office has agreed, has agreed, to reschedule the meeting dedicated to Ra'a. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=83.5s)]
*  So we're now working with them to set, to find a convenient date that's obviously going to work for both sides. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  The delegation was originally supposed to arrive in Washington this week, but the Israeli leader canceled the visit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  He was angry over the U.S. decision not to veto a resolution at the UN Security Council. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  It called for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=110.1s)]
*  A federal appeals court has weighed in on an elections case in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=114.7s)]
*  It could play a role in determining who wins this year's presidential race and other elections in the key swing state. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=118.5s)]
*  The court has ruled that mail-in ballots that arrive on time, but without handwritten dates on their envelopes, should not be counted. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=125.2s)]
*  NPR's Hansi Lo Wang explains. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=134.1s)]
*  The ruling by a panel of the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to be appealed and set up a potential Supreme Court battle. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=136.3s)]
*  State law requires mail-in ballots to be sent in envelopes with a current date handwritten by the voter. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=142.8s)]
*  But those dates are not used to verify whether a person is qualified to vote. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  The Third Circuit panel has now struck down a lower courts ruling that found that not counting what are often called undated ballots violates the Civil Rights Act, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  which says a person's right to vote cannot be denied for an error that is, quote, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=158.5s)]
*  not material in determining if a person is eligible to vote. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=161.5s)]
*  Pennsylvania officials recently redesigned the outer envelopes for the mail-in ballots to try to remind voters to write the current date under their signatures. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=165.0s)]
*  Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=171.8s)]
*  The convicted head of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX will be sentenced in federal court today in New York. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9mr9F236nU&t=173.4s)]
