# Trump Wins A Second Term In Office | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, November 6th. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump has won the 2024 election and he will become the next president of the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=6.76s)]
*  A short time ago, the Associated Press called the swing state of Wisconsin for him. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=13.72s)]
*  That pushed Trump to 277 electoral college votes. 270 votes are needed to clinch victory. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=18.28s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris has 224 votes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=24.52s)]
*  Trump didn't wait for that declaration this morning. NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports that overnight, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=28.08s)]
*  he and his family appeared before a crowd of supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=33.4s)]
*  Flanked by his family and staff, Trump declared victory before a crowd of supporters in West Palm Beach. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=38.04s)]
*  We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible and it is now clear that we've achieved the most incredible political thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=43.64s)]
*  Look what happened. Is this crazy? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  Trump didn't mention Vice President Kamala Harris by name and said he wants to help the country heal. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=55.88s)]
*  During his campaign, Trump focused on voters' concerns about the economy and illegal immigration. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  He also said he would seek retribution against his political opponents during a campaign fueled by anger and grievance. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania in July. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=73.0s)]
*  After the Secret Service pulled him to the ground, Trump got up and raised his fist, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  an image that became a rallying cry for the remainder of his campaign. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=81.44s)]
*  Barbara Sprunt in Peer News, Washington. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=85.56s)]
*  Republicans have flipped control of the U.S. Senate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=88.0s)]
*  They've won at least two seats from the Democrats, one in West Virginia and another in Ohio, giving them 51 Senate seats. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=90.72s)]
*  There are other Senate races yet to be called. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=98.28s)]
*  The issue of abortion appeared on ballots in 10 states. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=101.6s)]
*  Voters in South Dakota, Nebraska and Florida have voted to keep abortion restrictions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=104.92s)]
*  However, a majority of Florida voters supported overturning that ban. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  But Florida required that 60 percent of voters approve the abortion measure in order for it to pass, and it failed to do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=114.36s)]
*  Abortion measures passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri and Nevada. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=121.72s)]
*  A vote in Montana is still too close to call. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Voters in New York have approved an amendment to the state constitution that protects abortion access. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=130.56s)]
*  From member station WAMC, Ian Pickes reports. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=136.32s)]
*  The Equal Rights Amendment was a response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=139.36s)]
*  The amendment does not include the word abortion, but it holds that no one can face discrimination based on sex, including pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive health care. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=144.24s)]
*  Shelly Hegan is president and CEO of Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  I just am really elated that we passed this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=158.84s)]
*  I think it makes New York the leader in protection of people's basic rights. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=163.44s)]
*  Republicans campaigned against the measure, claiming it would enshrine rights for transgender women to compete in women's sports and for minors to receive gender affirming care without parental consent. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=170.0s)]
*  Ian Pickes reporting. It's NPR. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytG9GG31N4&t=180.72s)]
