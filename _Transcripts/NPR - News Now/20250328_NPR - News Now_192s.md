*  The magnitude 7.7 earthquake toppled buildings near the epicenter. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=21.82s)]
*  And it rattled neighboring Thailand's capital, Bangkok, hundreds of miles away. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=26.68s)]
*  NPR's John Rewich reports Thai officials say that at least three people have been killed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=31.56s)]
*  in that country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=36.84s)]
*  The U.S. Geological Survey says the epicenter was about six miles deep and not far from [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=38.12s)]
*  the city of Mandalay in central Myanmar. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=42.12s)]
*  Mandalay is the country's second biggest city after Yangon, with a population of around [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=44.72s)]

*  including one with a magnitude of 6.4. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=54.6s)]

*  in what appears to be the quake zone. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  In one video from Bangkok, a high rise under construction crumbles to the ground, sending [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=64.3s)]

*  Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on imports of foreign automobiles. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=86.56s)]
*  Carney would not say exactly what response Canada will take. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=91.76s)]
*  He's waiting for next week, when a raft of additional Trump tariffs will take effect [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=95.36s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=99.72s)]
*  Carney does say things have changed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=100.72s)]
*  The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=103.16s)]

*  As NPR's Jeff Brumfield reports, the lab maintains a crucial catalog of atomic properties. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=136.0s)]
*  The Atomic Spectroscopy Group is made up of just seven federal scientists at the National [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=141.96s)]
*  Institute of Standards and Technology. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=146.8s)]
*  For 120 years, it's had a really important job maintaining a catalog of atomic spectra, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=149.2s)]
*  the unique colors emitted by different elements in the periodic table. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=155.24s)]
*  These atomic fingerprints are used throughout science and industry for things like GPS, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=159.24s)]
*  and microchip manufacturing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=164.68s)]
*  Elizabeth Goldschmidt is a physicist at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=166.6s)]
*  Having these reliable standards is what allows industries to innovate and make new products. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=171.12s)]
*  According to an email from the group's leader, the administration plans its closure in a [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  matter of weeks. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  More than 3,000 researchers have signed a petition to try and save it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9TUHfLDhBs&t=182.4s)]
