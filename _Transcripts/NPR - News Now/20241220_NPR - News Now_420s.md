# Lawmakers Scramble As Federal Government Shutdown Looms | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM)
*  Lawmakers continue to scramble to avert a partial federal government shutdown that is set to begin tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=0.0s)]
*  And the suspect, the UnitedHealthcare CEO's death, is now facing federal charges. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=6.4s)]
*  Good afternoon. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=11.8s)]
*  The federal government faces a partial shutdown tonight unless Congress passes spending legislation to keep it open. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=16.6s)]
*  A short-term bill backed by House Speaker Mike Johnson and President-elect Trump collapsed last night. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=22.6s)]
*  Nearly all Democrats and scores of Republicans rejected it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=28.0s)]
*  Now, Speaker Johnson says he is prepared to move forward fast. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=31.6s)]
*  We're expecting votes this morning, so y'all stay tuned. We've got a plan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=35.8s)]
*  Democrats are demanding that the Speaker restore the original bipartisan spending plan unveiled earlier this week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=39.0s)]
*  But Trump and his billionaire ally, Elon Musk, torpedoed that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=45.0s)]
*  Some Republicans are furious over Trump's views on how much money the federal government can borrow to pay its bills. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=49.2s)]
*  Trump wants to get rid of the debt ceiling or extend the time frame for it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=56.0s)]
*  Some Republicans say that is not fiscally responsible. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  The man charged with killing UnitedHealthcare's CEO, Brian Thompson, is now in New York facing federal charges. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=63.4s)]
*  From member station WNYC, Samantha Max reports. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=69.6s)]
*  Federal prosecutors charged the Ouija Mangione with murder, firearm, and stalking charges. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=73.0s)]
*  They say he took a bus to New York City and waited outside a hotel where CEO Brian Thompson was staying for an investor conference. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=79.0s)]
*  Then, prosecutors say Mangione shot the CEO with an untraceable ghost gun and fled to Pennsylvania. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=87.4s)]
*  A new criminal complaint cites a letter addressed, quote, to the feds that police found after Mangione's arrest. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=94.6s)]
*  It also quotes from a notebook where officials say he wrote about his plans to target the insurance industry. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=101.8s)]
*  Mangione was already facing state charges in New York and Pennsylvania, including for murder as an act of terrorism. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=108.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Samantha Max in New York. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=116.4s)]
*  A new study finds the number of executions in the U.S. remains about the same this year as it has been recently. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=120.0s)]
*  Twenty-five people have been put to death in 2024. NPR's Martin Kosty reports. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=126.6s)]
*  Robin Maher is the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which just published its annual report. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=132.0s)]
*  She says the death penalty was not a major political issue this year and not much has changed. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=137.8s)]
*  Public support for the death penalty remains at a bare majority, which is 53 percent. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  That's a five-decade low. But active use of the death penalty remains limited to just a minority of states. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=148.0s)]
*  Just four states accounted for three-quarters of all executions this year, and Maher says that has contributed to making the death penalty a, quote, local issue, which escapes the notice of most Americans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  Twenty-seven states have the death penalty on the books, though five of those have paused executions by order of their governors. Martin Kosty, NPR News. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=165.2s)]
*  The Oxford, Michigan school shooter failed to withdraw his guilty plea to first-degree murder, terrorism and other charges. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  Ethan Crumbly's attorney said he didn't understand what he was doing when he entered the plea, but the judge was not convinced, as NPR's Kristen Wright reports. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=181.2s)]
*  The judge said Ethan Crumbly's guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily and accurately given. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=189.8s)]
*  He also rejected Crumbly's request to be re-sentenced, the school shooter serving life without the possibility of parole. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  But Crumbly's new defense team argued the now 18-year-old was only 16 and living with mental illness and cognitive impairment when he pleaded guilty, waiving his right to a trial. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=202.10000000000002s)]
*  They claim his previous attorneys failed to properly raise these issues during the plea process and sentencing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  The same judge who handed down Crumbly's sentence last December concluded Thursday he showed no signs of confusion when he pleaded guilty and the sentence stands. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=217.8s)]
*  Crumbly murdered four classmates and wounded seven other people in 2021. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  His parents were the first in the nation to be convicted in a school shooting committed by their child. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=230.8s)]

*  Now, they are designated a terrorist organization and they are desperate for the U.S. to drop that so that it can get aid, desperate aid to rebuild the country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=266.9s)]
*  And Piers Hadil al-Shelchi reporting. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQdm8xoS3yM&t=275.79999999999995s)]
