*  stretches into a fourth day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=4.48s)]
*  And authorities in Minnesota say they have arrested the suspect wanted for two shooting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  deaths over the weekend. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  The death toll has grown on both sides of the Israeli-Iranian conflict. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=17.02s)]
*  They're exchanging fire for a fourth day. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=21.04s)]
*  Iran's Ministry of Health says more than 200 people have been killed, including many women [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=23.56s)]
*  and children. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=27.72s)]
*  Another 1,000 Iranians have been injured. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=28.72s)]
*  In Israel, officials say more than 20 people have been killed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=31.52s)]
*  And Piers Hadil Al-Shelji has more. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=35.16s)]
*  The Israeli military said that four areas in northern and central Israel were struck [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=37.48s)]
*  by Iranian overnight missiles. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=41.78s)]
*  Videos posted online showed fire engulfing buildings in the northern city of Haifa. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=44.2s)]
*  While President Trump said that the two sides needed to quote, end this bloody conflict, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=49.16s)]
*  he then told reporters that quote, sometimes they have to fight it out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  Israeli Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave an interview to Fox News and doubled down [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=57.68s)]
*  on continuing the war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=61.56s)]
*  The issue here is not de-escalation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=63.08s)]
*  The issue here is not ceasefire. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=65.16s)]
*  The issue here is stopping those things that will threaten our survival. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=67.44s)]
*  And we're committed to stopping them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=71.6s)]
*  And I think we can achieve them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=73.52s)]
*  Iran has not signaled publicly, at least, that talks were imminent. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=74.88s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shelji, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=78.36s)]
*  Authorities in Minnesota have arrested the suspect wanted in connection with the shooting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=81.74000000000001s)]

*  Police found a car belonging to Belter down the road from his home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=98.9s)]

*  run into the woods, so authorities hurried to set up a perimeter. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=107.48s)]
*  Brule says officers called Belter out of the forest and into a field where he surrendered. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=111.44s)]
*  Authorities say Belter was armed, but they did not specify what type of weapon he had. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=117.08s)]

*  As NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Leibin reports, Trump has one-on-one meetings planned with multiple [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=130.96s)]
*  leaders, including some who are not from G7 nations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=136.0s)]

*  White House officials also confirm that he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=144.72s)]
*  Zelensky and Mexican President Claudia Schoenbaum. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=148.18s)]
*  The White House has said Trump hopes to talk about topics including migration, drug smuggling, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=151.5s)]
*  and trade at this week's summit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  Trump has imposed tariffs on goods from all of his fellow G7 countries. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=157.72s)]
*  Trump's America First worldview has put him at odds with foreign leaders at past G7s. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  In his first term, they clashed over climate change and trade. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=166.34s)]
*  But his team also took issue with G7 agendas, thinking covering non-economic topics like [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=169.74s)]
*  culture and climate change constituted overreach. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=174.34s)]
*  Danielle Kurtz-Leibin, NPR News, Calgary. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=177.74s)]
*  President Trump has ordered officials in his administration to expand deportation campaigns [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=180.94s)]
*  in large, democratically-led cities. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=185.9s)]
*  As NPR's Adrian Florido reports, writing online, Trump said they should do all they can to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  achieve his mass deportation goals. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=193.66s)]
*  ICE officers are herewith ordered, Trump wrote on Truth Social, to detain and deport illegal [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=196.66s)]
*  aliens in America's largest cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=201.3s)]
*  The president went on to accuse democratic leaders in those and other cities of using [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=206.46s)]
*  immigrants without legal status to expand their voter base and to cheat in elections. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=211.38s)]
*  There's never been evidence of this, but the president's post suggests that more than a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=216.06s)]
*  week after ICE agents began aggressive raids in Los Angeles, setting off protests, other [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=219.56s)]
*  large cities could soon expect the same. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=224.92s)]
*  Trump wrote, quote, I have directed my entire administration to put every resource possible [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=227.55999999999997s)]
*  behind this effort. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=232.0s)]
*  Adrian Florido, NPR News, Los Angeles. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=233.72s)]
*  The Agriculture Department estimates about half the workers in that industry do not have [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=236.16s)]
*  legal status in the U.S. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=240.54s)]
*  NPR's Jimena Bustillo reports, President Trump's efforts to increase deportations is leaving [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=242.67999999999998s)]

*  Last week, federal immigration officials carried out several arrests at a meatpacking plant [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=250.44s)]
*  in Nebraska and at farms in California. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  The move was seen by farmworker advocates as the biggest targeted sweep on the agriculture [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=256.76s)]
*  sector so far this year. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=260.8s)]
*  For months, administration officials have sent mixed messages over how protected farm [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=262.8s)]
*  and food system workers are from the goal of deporting everyone without legal status. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=267.4s)]
*  Trump has said that he wants to provide some solutions to farmers, but other cabinet officials [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=272.28s)]
*  are united on another message that anyone without legal status has to leave. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=276.9s)]
*  Still, labor advocates say even if arrests don't happen at the work sites, arrests in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=281.88s)]
*  the communities where workers live could still disrupt the supply chain. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=287.0s)]
*  Jimena Bustillo, NPR News, Washington. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=291.08s)]

*  efforts to deport certain migrants. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=298.24s)]

*  In Major League Baseball, Shohei Otani of the Los Angeles Dodgers is scheduled to pitch [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=346.24s)]
*  tonight for the first time in nearly two years. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=351.12s)]
*  As Steve Futterman reports, Otani has been recovering from injury. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=354.52s)]
*  It is one of the most anticipated returns in many years. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  The last time Shohei Otani pitched was in September 2023, when he was still with the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=362.28s)]
*  LA Angels. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=367.76s)]
*  Otani suffered an elbow injury and underwent surgery. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=369.36s)]
*  Last year, after leaving the Angels and joining the Dodgers, Otani still played, but only [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=372.8s)]
*  as a designated hitter. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=377.48s)]

*  I don't know if it's going to be one or two innings, but you know, my guess is probably [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=384.68s)]
*  an inning to start. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t1KbqguXz8&t=389.4s)]
