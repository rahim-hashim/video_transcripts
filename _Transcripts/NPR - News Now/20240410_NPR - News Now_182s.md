# Jury Selection In Trump’s N.Y. Criminal Trial Starts Monday | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, April 10th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Abortions will be completely banned in Arizona in two weeks, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  except to save the life of the mother. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=9.8s)]
*  The Arizona Supreme Court has upheld a Civil War-era law [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=12.0s)]
*  that has no exceptions for rape or incest and none for pregnancy complications. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=15.5s)]
*  Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs says the law requires prison time for doctors [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  who perform the procedure. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=25.1s)]
*  She says Arizona lawmakers who support total abortion bans [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=26.6s)]
*  are not going to stop with that law. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  These extreme legislators sent a fetal personhood bill to my desk [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=32.300000000000004s)]
*  that I was able to veto last year. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  This is a bill that would have paved the way for an Alabama-style ruling [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=39.7s)]
*  that would ban IVF. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=43.8s)]
*  In Arizona, they're going after contraception. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=45.5s)]
*  This doesn't stop at abortion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=48.5s)]
*  She spoke to CNN. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=50.3s)]
*  Jury selection is set to start next Monday [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=52.2s)]
*  for former President Donald Trump's New York criminal trial. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=54.6s)]
*  He's pleaded not guilty to 34 counts involving alleged hush money payments [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=57.9s)]
*  made before the 2016 election. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=62.6s)]
*  And Piers Jimena Bustillo reports the judge has released questions [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=65.3s)]
*  for the potential jurors. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=68.9s)]
*  This is the first criminal trial featuring a former or sitting president, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=70.8s)]
*  and Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee for the 2024 election. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=74.6s)]
*  Still, jurors will not be asked for whom they have or will vote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=78.5s)]
*  nor will lawyers question them about their political affiliations [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=82.5s)]
*  or campaign contributions. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=85.7s)]
*  Judge Juan Murchon believes those views will be made clear through other questions. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=87.8s)]
*  These include where and how they consume news, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=92.4s)]
*  if they have ever attended a rally or campaign event for Trump, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=95.1s)]
*  volunteered for his campaign, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=98.7s)]
*  or been part of any quote, anti-Trump efforts. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=100.2s)]
*  The jurors will also be asked if they have read or listened to any podcasts [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=103.5s)]
*  or books by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=107.3s)]
*  and if they are a member of a list of extremist and white supremacist groups. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  Jimena Bustillo, NPR News, New York. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=114.3s)]
*  Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is at the White House today. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=116.6s)]
*  His visit comes as the Biden administration is looking to its close ally Japan [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=120.7s)]
*  to help quell tension in the South China Sea. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=125.8s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Shivaram reports Kishida's visit also comes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=129.0s)]
*  as Japanese company Nippon Steel is planning to take over U.S. Steel, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=132.7s)]
*  a move Biden opposes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=137.5s)]
*  A senior administration official says the topic of Nippon is not on the agenda [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=139.6s)]
*  for Biden and Kishida's meeting, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=143.6s)]
*  but they will discuss strengthening the military partnerships [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=145.4s)]
*  between the U.S. and Japan. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=148.2s)]
*  The two will announce an agreement about space exploration [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=150.4s)]
*  and joint research projects regarding artificial intelligence. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=153.5s)]
*  The Japanese Prime Minister will also visit the National Mall [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  to plant a cherry tree, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=160.5s)]
*  which has long been a symbol of friendship between the U.S. and Japan. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=161.7s)]
*  Tonight, Biden will host Kishida for his fifth state dinner, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=165.6s)]
*  and on Thursday, Biden and Kishida will take part in a trilateral meeting [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=168.9s)]
*  with President Marcos of the Philippines. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJuBk7SXOpc&t=172.8s)]
