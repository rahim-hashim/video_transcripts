# Final Full Day Of Campaigning Gets Underway | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM)
*  As the final full day of campaigning gets underway, tens of millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=0.0s)]
*  And abortion is on ballots in 10 states, including Arizona, Nevada, and Florida. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=6.28s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=11.58s)]
*  This is the final full day of campaigning in the race for the White House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=15.98s)]
*  Vice President Harris has several events scheduled today in the swing state of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=19.26s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump will also go to Pennsylvania, along with North Carolina and Michigan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=23.46s)]
*  And Beersmore-Eliason reports tens of millions of Americans have already cast ballots. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=28.9s)]
*  More than 75 million people have cast their votes already, by mail or in person, depending on their state's rules. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=34.1s)]
*  That's a little less than half the total vote cast in the 2020 presidential election. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=40.7s)]
*  But the early vote doesn't tell you whether overall turnout will be higher than 2020, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=45.74s)]
*  because many early voters are people who would otherwise have voted in person on Tuesday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=50.18s)]
*  One trend that can be seen is the large numbers of women who are voting early. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=55.18s)]
*  The gender gap in turnout is mirroring the gender gap in the polls, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=59.68s)]
*  where women are choosing Harris by big margins and male voters are choosing Trump. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  That's why Trump is reaching out to white, non-college educated men who support him heavily, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=67.78s)]
*  but don't usually turn out to vote. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=72.72s)]
*  Mar Eliason, NPR News. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Abortion is on the ballot in 10 states, including the swing states of Arizona and Nevada. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=77.2s)]
*  Tomorrow, people in Florida will vote on a constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to an abortion until fetal viability. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=83.12s)]
*  That is usually around 24 weeks of pregnancy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=90.72s)]
*  Right now, abortion is banned in Florida after six weeks, with some exceptions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=93.86s)]
*  From member station WUSF, Stephanie Columbini reports on a Tampa woman who says the current Florida law put her health at risk. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=98.56s)]
*  Thea Thompson tried to qualify for an exception to Florida's ban because her fetus had a genetic disorder that was likely fatal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=107.06s)]
*  But she says due to legal concerns, doctors wouldn't approve it unless she got additional testing, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  even though they warned she was at higher risk for the test to cause complications. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=119.2s)]
*  Thompson spent thousands to travel to New York for abortion care instead. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=123.84s)]
*  I'm mad. I'm really angry that I was put in that position because of the laws, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  because of the politicians who are making decisions about my own health. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=132.8s)]
*  Thompson supports the abortion amendment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=138.4s)]
*  Governor Rondy Santas is among those opposing it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=140.34s)]
*  He says the ban's exceptions are clear. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=142.98s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Stephanie Columbini in Tampa. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=145.24s)]
*  Striking machinists for Boeing are going to vote today on their third contract offer from the troubled aircraft maker. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=148.34s)]
*  They've been on strike for about two months. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=154.96s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports that union leaders say Boeing has moved a great deal since its prior contract offers were rejected, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=157.28s)]
*  and this proposed deal is sweeter. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=164.78s)]
*  Boeing is offering a 38 percent wage hike. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=167.12s)]
*  That is up from 25 percent in their first offer, though it is still not quite the 40 percent raise the union wanted. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=169.62s)]
*  Union leaders are endorsing this offer. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  That's something they notably did not do for that previous proposal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=177.56s)]
*  And they say, quote, It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  And bears Joel Rose prepared that report. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=185.9s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeeKfXwXsM&t=189.3s)]
