# Biden Hits The Campaign Trail After State Of The Union | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo)
*  Biden hits the road today after delivering his State of the Union address last night [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=0.0s)]
*  and a probe into the police response to the 2022 Uvalde, Texas school shooting found fault [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  with some of the victims' families. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=11.84s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=12.84s)]
*  President Biden is out on the road today highlighting themes from his State of the Union address [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=16.64s)]
*  last night. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=20.82s)]
*  Today, he'll travel to Philadelphia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=21.82s)]
*  Biden discussed issues from abortion to immigration in his speech last night and he jeered Republican [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=24.38s)]
*  Republicans who torpedoed border legislation that lawmakers had worked on for months. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=29.98s)]
*  The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=34.78s)]
*  ever seen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=39.42s)]
*  Oh, you don't think so? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=40.42s)]
*  Oh, you don't like that bill, huh? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=43.42s)]
*  That conservatives got together and said it was a good bill? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  I'll be darned. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=51.74s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=52.74s)]
*  The border bill had won some key Republican support until former President Donald Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  slammed it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=59.4s)]
*  It was voted down in the Senate the same week it was introduced. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=60.44s)]
*  There will be another big shakeup in the Republican National Committee today and Bios Franco-Ortoneos [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=63.92s)]
*  reports the 168 members of the RNC are going to elect new leadership. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  They're expected to pick several loyalists to former President Donald Trump, including [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=75.28s)]
*  Michael Watley, the chair of the North Carolina GOP, as well as Trump's daughter-in-law, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=79.64s)]
*  Lara Trump, as co-chair. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Having someone with his last name as co-chair has raised some eyebrows, but Morton Blackwell, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=87.48s)]
*  a member from Louisiana, thinks it's a good thing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=93.48s)]
*  One of her roles will be raising money and Blackwell expects she'll be able to reach [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=97.04s)]
*  people who don't usually give to the RNC. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=101.38000000000001s)]
*  So I think the finances of the RNC are going to be significantly improved by having her [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=104.16s)]
*  co-chairman. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=110.84s)]
*  He also pointed out that the RNC's ability to raise funds is directly tied to its relationship [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=111.84s)]
*  with Trump, Franco-Ortoneos. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=116.92s)]
*  NPR News, Houston. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  The city of Uvalde, Texas has released an independent investigation into the police [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=121.68s)]
*  response to the mass school shooting at Robb Elementary School in 2022. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=126.84s)]
*  It cited failures in communication and leadership, but the Texas newsroom Sergio Martinez Beltran [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=132.2s)]
*  tells us the report says local officers on scene did not violate any department policies [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=137.64s)]
*  and the report blamed some victims' families instead. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=143.72s)]
*  According to the report, none of the 25 Uvalde officers violated policy when they responded [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=147.08s)]
*  to the shooting despite waiting 77 minutes to kill the gunman. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  The report blamed families who rushed to the school that day for compromising the police [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  response. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  The investigation also exonerates Mariano Pargas, the acting Uvalde Police Department [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  chief the day of the shooting. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  Veronica Mata, mother of 10-year-old victim Tess, slammed the report's findings. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=167.56s)]
*  All this is, it's a pact, it's a brother's pact. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=172.6s)]
*  You protect your own. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=176.04s)]
*  Earlier this year, the Department of Justice found cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=177.92s)]
*  tactics, policy and training. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=183.28s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sergio Martinez Beltran in Austin. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=186.48s)]

*  entering the record books and completing the roughly 30,000-mile journey right where she [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=206.64s)]
*  started. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=210.84s)]

*  other competitors, all of whom were men and more than half of whom dropped out before [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=216.68s)]
*  finishing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=220.68s)]

*  and it just felt like it was just forever. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=232.88s)]
*  The post showed her both braving the elements as well as moments of awe, and she tells NBC [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAKMDJTkQo&t=235.92000000000002s)]
