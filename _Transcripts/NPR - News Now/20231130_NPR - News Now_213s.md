# Former Diplomat Henry Kissinger Dies At 100 | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM)
*  Good morning. It's Thursday, November 30th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=0.0s)]
*  are today's top stories. Israel and Hamas have agreed on another day of pause in fighting. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=5.44s)]
*  It may mean Hamas will free more hostages. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=10.16s)]
*  and says he'd like this to continue, as NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=14.96s)]
*  Secretary Blinken calls it a very positive development that some of the hostages are [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=19.04s)]
*  being reunited with their families and more humanitarian aid is getting to innocent civilians [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=23.56s)]
*  in Gaza who desperately need it. This process is producing results. It's important, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=28.8s)]
*  and we hope that it can continue. He was speaking alongside Israel's president, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=34.72s)]
*  Isaac Herzog, who says there are about 150 hostages still held by Hamas, including a baby [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=39.04s)]
*  and a toddler. Blinken says the U.S. has been, in his words, relentlessly focused on this since the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=45.6s)]
*  October 7th attack by Hamas. He says he's also here meeting separately with Israelis and Palestinians [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=51.68s)]
*  to talk about the way ahead for Gaza. Michelle Kellerman, NPR News Tel Aviv. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=58.48s)]
*  Israeli police in Jerusalem say gunmen opened fire on people at a bus stop today. Three people [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  were killed. Police say off-duty soldiers and a civilian killed the two attackers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=69.36s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has died at the age of 100. As NPR's Tom Jolton reports, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  Kissinger played key roles in opening trade with China in the early 70s and in talks to end the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=80.24s)]
*  Vietnam War. Henry Kissinger's energetic diplomacy under Presidents Nixon and Ford helped stabilize [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=85.6s)]
*  U.S. relations with China and the Soviet Union. He had many achievements, but also some notable [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=92.0s)]
*  failures. None more evident than his 1972 announcement that the Vietnam War was on the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=97.83999999999999s)]
*  verge of being settled. We believe that peace is at hand, he said. We believe that an agreement is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=103.6s)]
*  in sight. Kissinger and his North Vietnamese counterpart won the Nobel Peace Prize for their [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=110.4s)]
*  efforts, but fighting continued for another three years. Tom Jolton, NPR News. The House of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=115.92s)]
*  Representatives could hold a vote as soon as today to expel New York Republican George Santos. He faces [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  a slew of federal corruption charges. Fellow New York Republican Nicole Malatakis wants Santos to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=129.28s)]
*  leave. I do believe it will be an overwhelming majority and I do believe that the expulsion [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=136.08s)]
*  will pass. I think we have the votes. Santos has denied wrongdoing but admits he could be expelled [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=142.72000000000003s)]
*  from the chamber. The owner of the social media platform X has attacked corporations that have [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  stopped advertising on his site. NPR's Bobby Allen reports Elon Musk says the advertiser boycott could [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  bankrupt his company, formerly known as Twitter. On stage at the New York Times Dealbook Summit, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=162.72s)]
*  Elon Musk made a rather crass suggestion as to what advertisers who have left could do to themselves. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=167.76s)]
*  Beyond cursing out companies that have pulled back advertising, Musk said the advertiser exodus [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=174.4s)]
*  could force X into bankruptcy. What this advertising boycott is going to do is it's going to kill the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=179.68s)]
*  company and the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company and we will document [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=185.6s)]
*  it in great detail. At the same time, Musk said a recent post of his that endorsed an anti-Semitic [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=191.28s)]
*  theory quote handed a loaded gun to his enemies and those who are anti-Semitic and for that he [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=195.84s)]
*  said he was sorry. He said it was perhaps one of the most foolish things he's ever said on the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=201.84s)]
*  platform. Bobby Allen, NPR News. I'm Corva Kuhlman, NPR News. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xziMVtOgVPM&t=206.4s)]
