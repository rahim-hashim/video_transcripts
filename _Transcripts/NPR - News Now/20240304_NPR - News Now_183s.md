# Harris Calls For A Cease-Fire In Gaza Over The Weekend | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, March 4th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris will meet a leading member of the Israeli War Cabinet today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=6.2s)]
*  Benny Gantz is in Washington to see several U.S. officials this week. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  He'll meet the vice president this afternoon at the White House. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=14.4s)]
*  Harris was in Alabama yesterday where she called for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=17.2s)]
*  Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=21.599999999999998s)]
*  For at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=34.6s)]
*  Harris also plans to press for a ceasefire deal that includes the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  The demand to leave Gaza is soaring. Palestinians are paying thousands of dollars to flee the war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Egypt is facing questions about border fees. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv these can reach $5,000 a person. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=52.800000000000004s)]
*  For most people in Gaza, the only available pathway out is to pay an Egyptian travel company, according to Palestinians who recently left. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=61.0s)]
*  One mechanical engineer, Mazen, told NPR he spent $20,000 to take his family of four to Egypt. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=68.4s)]
*  After we lost everything in Gaza, all our positions, we have to collect the amount of money, which is a big sum, just to buy our lives. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=74.6s)]
*  He spoke without his full name to protect his residency status in Egypt. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=86.0s)]
*  On March 1st alone, around 400 Palestinians who left Gaza paid around $1.3 million total, according to an NPR estimate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  Egypt's foreign minister told Sky News he wanted to eliminate the practice. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=97.6s)]
*  Analysts say the company collecting the money has ties to Egyptian security officials. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=102.0s)]
*  Congressional leaders have released the texts of six government funding bills. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=108.2s)]
*  Lawmakers need to pass these bills before Friday to avoid a partial federal government shutdown. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=112.6s)]
*  But NPR's Eric McDaniel reports there are only half the bills that Congress needs to pass to avert a second potential shutdown that could come later in March. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  The agencies in this package are the less contested battlefields in the appropriations fight. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=127.2s)]
*  The Department of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Veterans Affairs, along with a few others, funding those agencies through September 30th. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=131.8s)]
*  The bills will lose support without the partisan policy writers that some House Republicans had been pushing for, so Speaker Mike Johnson will have to rely on Democratic support to pass the bills. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=139.4s)]
*  After the vote this week, Congress will have until March 22nd to sort the harder six bills, including funding for the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=149.0s)]
*  Lawmakers are already five months late to these deals. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=157.4s)]
*  They've been extending funding for just a few weeks or months at a time, hampering federal agencies' ability to plan. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=160.2s)]
*  Eric McDaniel in PR News, Washington. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=166.2s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump won three Republican presidential contests over the weekend in Idaho, Missouri and Michigan. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=168.6s)]
*  Rival Nikki Haley won the contest in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=175.7s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXzdxt6twsQ&t=180.2s)]
