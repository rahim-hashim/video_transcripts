# Trump Rally Comedian Calls Puerto Rico An 'Island Of Garbage' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc)
*  35 million Americans have already cast their ballots in this fall's presidential election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=0.0s)]
*  And Egypt is proposing a brief ceasefire in Gaza and an exchange of hostages and prisoners. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=5.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=11.56s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=12.56s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump held a campaign rally yesterday at New York's Madison Square [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=15.8s)]
*  Garden. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  But inflammatory remarks from some of his guest speakers are now threatening to overshadow [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Trump's own campaign speech. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=24.32s)]
*  And Piers Daniel Kurtz-Levin reports. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=26.32s)]
*  President Tony Hinchcliffe started the rally with remarks that included a joke referring [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=28.64s)]
*  to Puerto Rico as a, quote, floating island of garbage. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=32.32s)]
*  Another speaker seemed to imply that Vice President Harris is a prostitute. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=36.7s)]
*  All told, more than four hours of speakers preceded Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=41.08s)]
*  During his speech, Trump doubled down on recent comments calling some Democrats the enemy [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=45.08s)]
*  from within and suggesting he'd use the military against them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=49.16s)]
*  And when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy, becomes this alcohol. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=53.28s)]
*  How can he say? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=58.96s)]
*  No, they've done very bad things to this country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=59.96s)]
*  They are indeed the enemy from within. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Trump is rallying supporters across swing states this week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Danielle Kurtz-Levin, NPR News, New York. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  The Trump campaign has released a statement saying that the comedian's joke about Puerto [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=70.36s)]
*  Rico does not reflect the views of former President Trump or the Trump campaign. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=74.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris spent the day yesterday crisscrossing Philadelphia, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=79.36s)]
*  and Piers Osmahalit has more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=84.08s)]
*  The vice president specifically was trying to energize black and brown voters, focused [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=85.96s)]
*  on energizing voters in the key state of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Here she is at a rally in Philadelphia. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=93.32s)]
*  We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regrets about what we could have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=95.16s)]
*  done in these next nine days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  Harris had a series of smaller retail stops visiting a black barbershop and later a Puerto [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=103.56s)]
*  Rican restaurant where she spoke about her plan for economic development and investment [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=108.56s)]
*  in the electrical grid on the island. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  Osmahalit, NPR News. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=115.12s)]
*  With about a week until Election Day, some 35 million voters around the country have [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  already cast their ballots early for this fall's election. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  And Piers Hansi Lo Wong reports. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=125.76s)]
*  If you're planning to vote by mail, the Postal Service is urging you to check your state's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=128.1s)]
*  deadline and return your ballot at least one week before that date, which may be coming [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=132.08s)]
*  up very soon now that the last day of voting is about one week away. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=136.52s)]
*  Absentee voters could also consider turning in their ballot at their local election office [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=140.08s)]
*  or at any available drop box. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=143.72s)]
*  Today is the last chance for eligible voters in Colorado and Washington to sign up online [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  to vote in this election. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=150.0s)]
*  Those who miss this deadline can still register in person through Election Day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=151.6s)]
*  There's also time to sign up in person in the swing states of Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=155.88s)]
*  But Wisconsinites, take note. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  You can get registered at your municipal clerk's office through Friday or wait to register [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  and vote at the polls on November 5th. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=167.01999999999998s)]

*  Another official briefed on the talks said Israel is considering the Egyptian proposal [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgvxqfBzflc&t=212.8s)]
