*  and the court's ruling won't change that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGhJA5uM7C8&t=92.52s)]
*  This is not a cause for celebration because the reality of certain things are still not going to change. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGhJA5uM7C8&t=94.76s)]

*  The Justice Department alleges the Phoenix Police Department uses excessive force [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGhJA5uM7C8&t=122.24s)]
*  and discriminates against people of color and says officers don't have enough oversight. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGhJA5uM7C8&t=127.19999999999999s)]

*  to the public and the media before allowing the decision makers and the department to review it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGhJA5uM7C8&t=153.8s)]
*  He says he would oppose any consent decree that could put the city of Phoenix under federal supervision for police reform. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGhJA5uM7C8&t=158.28s)]
