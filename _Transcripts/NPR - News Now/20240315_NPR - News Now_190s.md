# New Wave Of Violence Breaks Out In Haiti’s Capital | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI)
*  A federal judge has denied a motion to dismiss charges against former President Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=0.0s)]
*  handling of classified documents and a new wave of violence has broken out in Haiti's capital. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=5.36s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Kristin Wright from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=11.44s)]
*  A federal judge in Florida is saying no to Donald Trump's request to dismiss charges in one of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=15.84s)]
*  criminal cases against the former president. It involves Trump's handling of classified documents [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=22.48s)]
*  after he left the White House. NPR's Greg Allen reports. Trump is charged with withholding and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=28.16s)]
*  concealing classified and top secret documents he took to Mar-a-Lago from the White House and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=34.16s)]
*  then lying about it to investigators. Judge Eileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, heard two motions to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  dismiss the case. In one, Trump says the statute under which he's being prosecuted is unconstitutionally [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=43.44s)]
*  vague. The judge denied that motion. Trump is charged with having unauthorized possession of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  classified and top secret documents. His lawyers say as president Trump effectively designated them [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  as personal records and gave him self-authorization to take them when he left the White House. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=58.08s)]
*  Judge Cannon has yet to rule on that motion. She says the defense arguments raise factual issues [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=62.64s)]
*  best brought up at trial. Greg Allen, NPR News, Fort Pierce. A judge will decide whether to delay [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=67.36s)]
*  Trump's hush money trial in New York. Prosecutors say they are open to a delay of up to 30 days. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=73.52s)]
*  Trump's legal team requested more time to review new records. Gangs in Haiti have unleashed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=80.48s)]
*  another day of violence in the country's capital. NPR's Adar Peralta reports it comes as political [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=88.16s)]
*  groups try to form a transitional council. The gangs rampaged across Port-au-Prince on Thursday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=95.04s)]
*  They shot at the airport just as workers had begun to fix damage from previous attacks. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=101.68s)]
*  Local news reported that gangs had also looted the house of the director of the national police [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  and then set it on fire. The violence follows a couple of days of relative quiet and it comes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=111.84s)]
*  days after Haiti's prime minister agreed to resign and days after the international community [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=117.2s)]
*  brokered a deal to install a transitional council that will eventually elect a new [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  transitional prime minister. Some prominent gang leaders have rejected the plan saying [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=127.04s)]
*  it doesn't represent the will of the Haitian people. The gangs have threatened more violence [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=132.16s)]
*  as a means to oppose the plan. Adar Peralta, NPR News, Cap Haitian in northern Haiti. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=137.28s)]
*  Russia's presidential election starts today. Vladimir Putin is expected to secure a fifth term. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=143.6s)]
*  NPR's Charles Maines says there are other candidates and those who did not make it on the ballot. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  Two anti-war candidates were disqualified over supposed registration violations and of course [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=156.0s)]
*  Putin's fiercest challenger Alexei Navalny died in a remote prison colony under circumstances [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=161.12s)]
*  still aren't clear. Navalny's allies certainly think his death or murder was timed to these [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=166.0s)]
*  elections. In fact they're calling on people to honor Navalny's last known political wish to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=170.64s)]
*  protest the vote by swarming the polling stations at noon on Sunday. Voting takes place over three [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  days. Tornadoes and severe weather swept parts of the Midwest killing at least three people in Ohio. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=180.88s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News in Washington. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI_ZNThP9YI&t=187.11999999999998s)]
