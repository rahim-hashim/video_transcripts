*  package for 225 million dollars. Zelensky said today's meeting would get into military strategy, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=29.28s)]
*  but was also symbolic. It's very important that you stay with us. This bipartisan support with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=35.68s)]
*  the Congress, it's very important that in this unity, United States, America, all American people [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=42.24s)]
*  stay with Ukraine. We're still in completely, said Biden. Tamara Keith, NPR News, Paris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=47.760000000000005s)]

*  NPR's Alaina Moore has more. President Biden's statements come just four days after Hunter [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Biden's trial began in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden's only surviving son faces three felony [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=70.08s)]
*  charges for illegally obtaining a firearm back in 2018. He was indicted last fall. Hunter Biden has [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=76.16s)]
*  previously been public about his longtime struggle with addiction. He is also expected to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=83.04s)]

*  everyone's interest. That would mean a kind of fire sale of everything from his ownership in his [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=138.08s)]
*  media company to his personal gun collection. In the end, that may yield only a couple hundred [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=143.28s)]
*  thousand dollars per plaintiff, but a judge has ruled Jones's debt will not be wiped out by [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=148.8s)]
*  bankruptcy so families can go after his future earnings and any assets he may have hidden for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=154.0s)]
*  the rest of his life. A judge will decide next week whether to approve the bankruptcy plan. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZpKPq6JtY&t=159.20000000000002s)]
