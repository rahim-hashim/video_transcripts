# Apple Doubles Down On AI With Its ChatGPT Partnership | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E)
*  Apple is doubling down on artificial intelligence, announcing a partnership with OpenAI yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=0.0s)]
*  And FDA advisers have strongly backed a new Alzheimer's drug, despite concerns about its [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  risks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=11.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=12.4s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=13.4s)]
*  The UN Security Council has endorsed a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=17.28s)]
*  President Biden outlined the plan last month, calling it an Israeli proposal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=21.96s)]
*  Hamas has released a statement saying it welcomes the resolution. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=25.96s)]
*  Israel has not commented on the resolution, and Piers Mitchell-Kellerman has more. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=29.62s)]
*  After a 14-0 vote with Russia abstaining, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=34.02s)]
*  the council is sending a clear message to Hamas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=39.02s)]
*  Israel has already agreed to this deal, and the fighting could stop today if Hamas would [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  do the same. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=47.58s)]
*  I repeat, the fighting could stop today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=48.86s)]
*  The ceasefire plan sets out three phases, starting with a six-week ceasefire, with Hamas [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=53.3s)]
*  releasing some hostages and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=58.26s)]
*  Hamas and Israel would then negotiate Phase 2, a permanent end to the war, and Israel's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=62.78s)]
*  withdrawal from Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=67.62s)]
*  Hamas wants a guarantee of a permanent ceasefire now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=69.68s)]
*  The third phase is rebuilding Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=72.82s)]
*  Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, the State Department. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=75.5s)]
*  Big tech company Apple has reached a new deal with OpenAI, a top artificial intelligence [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=78.94s)]
*  company. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  They're going to pair AI technology with Apple's digital assistant, Siri, and Piers [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=85.74s)]
*  Dara Kerr explains. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=90.74s)]
*  With Siri now, you can ask it questions, and it'll point you where to find answers on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=92.86s)]
*  the web. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=97.06s)]
*  But when it gets integrated with ChatGBT, it will have OpenAI's technology and be able [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=98.06s)]
*  to scrape the web and form its own answers. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  So if you ask it something like how to make a Philly cheesesteak, it will search recipes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=106.58s)]
*  all over the web and come back with its own ingredient list and cooking instructions. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=110.78s)]
*  And like ChatGBT, Siri will also be able to compose essays or stories. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=116.06s)]
*  NPR's Dara Kerr reporting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=121.06s)]
*  A committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration has recommended approving a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=123.22s)]
*  new drug for Alzheimer's disease. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=127.82s)]
*  NPR's John Hamilton reports that members endorsed the drug despite concern about its [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=130.3s)]
*  risks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=135.62s)]
*  The drug is Dananamab, a lab-made antibody designed to remove the amyloid plaque that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=136.62s)]
*  builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=141.3s)]
*  Dananamab appears to slow the progression of Alzheimer's by more than a third, but [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=144.46s)]
*  like other drugs in its class, it can cause swelling or bleeding in the brain. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=148.78s)]
*  Dr. Risa Sperling of Harvard Medical School told the committee that Dananamab's benefits [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=153.02s)]
*  outweigh its risks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=158.02s)]
*  We have to take Alzheimer's disease seriously, and serious diseases require aggressive treatments. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=159.78s)]
*  At the end of an all-day meeting, the advisors unanimously recommended Dananamab be approved. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=166.52s)]
*  The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=171.96s)]
*  John Hamilton, NPR News. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  Jurors are set to continue deliberating today in the federal gun trial of Hunter Biden. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=177.8s)]
*  Prosecutors accuse the president's son of lying about his drug use when he bought a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=183.88s)]
*  gun several years ago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  He is pleaded not guilty. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=188.72s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoddXNCq_1E&t=191.64000000000001s)]
