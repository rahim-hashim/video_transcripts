# After Ceasefire Breakdown, Israel Weighs Full Occupation Of Gaza | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc)
*  Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=0.0s)]
*  Today is Monday, March 24th. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=1.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=3.0s)]
*  Israel is considering a major ground invasion into Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The goals are to fully occupy the Palestinian territory within a few months and establish [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Israeli military rule over Palestinians living there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=16.56s)]
*  NPR's Jan Esteren in Tel Aviv spoke with two people who have reviewed the plans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Both people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the classified military plans. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=25.76s)]
*  They said the plans would have major forces occupy Gaza, pushing Palestinians into a small [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=30.12s)]
*  zone designated for civilians, and that Israel is examining options for the military to take [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=34.68s)]
*  control of distributing food at a minimal caloric amount. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=39.88s)]
*  Both people who reviewed the plans said it was unclear if or when the plans would be [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=43.94s)]
*  carried out, or if they were a negotiation tactic to pressure Hamas to release more Israeli [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=47.42s)]
*  hostages. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=52.58s)]
*  The military said it would not comment on future operational plans. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=53.76s)]
*  It has announced it's mobilizing another army division for ground operations. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=57.42s)]
*  Daniel Esteren, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=61.8s)]
*  This afternoon, a federal appeals court will take up President Trump's appeal to block [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=64.4s)]
*  lower court judges' orders to release information about recent deportation flights. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=69.06s)]
*  U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg wants to know why Trump used wartime power to deport [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=74.4s)]
*  hundreds of migrants when the U.S. is not at war. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=80.92s)]
*  The power is known as the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=84.12s)]
*  President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, says the administration will not defy the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=87.48s)]
*  judge's order but will continue to deport migrants. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=91.58s)]
*  I don't care about that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=94.76s)]
*  Judges think as far as this case, we're going to continue to arrest public safety threats [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=96.44s)]
*  and national security threats. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=100.84s)]
*  We're going to continue to deport them from the United States. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=102.12s)]
*  I understand this case is in litigation through the Alien Enemies Act and will abide by the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=104.72s)]
*  court order as litigated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=109.92s)]
*  He spoke to ABC News' This Week. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=111.66s)]
*  Members of one of the largest unions of U.S. postal workers held rallies across the country [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  These were to protest the Trump administration's proposals to transform the agency. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  As NPR's Hansi Le Wong reports, Trump officials have floated the idea of bringing the independent [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  mail agency under White House control. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=131.64s)]
*  U.S. mail is not for sale! [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=134.92s)]
*  Members of the National Association of Letter Carriers in cities including Silver Spring, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=138.76s)]
*  Maryland demonstrated against comments last month by President Trump. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=142.0s)]
*  He cited trouble finances at USPS and said his administration is considering having the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=145.36s)]
*  Commerce Department take control of what Congress set up to be an independent postal service. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=149.22s)]
*  Legal experts say that will likely violate federal law. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=153.52s)]
*  NALC union steward Kevin Abernathy says he's also concerned about talk of privatizing the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=155.92s)]
*  country's mail service. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=159.84s)]
*  If they carve up and sell the postal service, we will lose small businesses, seniors, veterans, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=160.84s)]
*  rural families and everyday customers who trust us to deliver. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=167.96s)]
*  The union of rural letter carriers is set to rally Tuesday on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=173.24s)]
*  Hansi Le Wong, NPR News, Silver Spring, Maryland. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=176.68s)]
*  Canadians will go to the polls April 28th for a national election. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=179.6s)]
*  As Dan Karpenchuk reports, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney triggered the election [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=183.22s)]
*  call by dissolving the country's parliament. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=187.56s)]
*  Recent polls suggest Carney's Liberals are in a tight race with the opposition Conservatives. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=190.52s)]
*  And this election campaign, only five weeks long, will focus on the main issue of tariffs [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=194.76s)]
*  and annexation talk from President Donald Trump. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=199.0s)]
*  Carney says in the past ten days since he's become Prime Minister, he's initiated several [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=202.0s)]
*  major changes, including getting rid of the unpopular carbon tax and expanding dental [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=205.88s)]
*  care to more than four million Canadians. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=210.72s)]
*  So Carney has asked for a strong mandate from voters in what he described as the most consequential [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=213.48s)]
*  election in a lifetime. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=217.88s)]
*  The Conservatives, led by Pierre Pauliev, continue to say Carney still represents the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=219.64s)]
*  old Liberals and their policies. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=223.9s)]
*  And it's time for a change. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=226.02s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Dan Karpenchuk in Toronto. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=227.46s)]
*  There will be a new champion this year in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=230.46s)]
*  That came after two-time defending champion Connecticut fell to the Florida Gators yesterday. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=235.18s)]
*  Greg Eklund has more on the men's and women's tournaments. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  To reach the Sweet 16, UConn would have to knock off a number one seed, the University [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=244.28s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=248.46s)]
*  The Gators prevailed, 77-75, and UConn Huskies coach Dan Hurley says he'll be going through [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=249.46s)]
*  what he calls rewiring in the upcoming offseason. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=256.42s)]
*  You just get caught up in this tidal wave of success that we've had and you know, you [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=259.62s)]
*  just lose perspective. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=266.94s)]
*  With Florida moving on to the Sweet 16, the Gators are one of seven SEC teams still alive. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=270.3s)]
*  The women's defending champion is the University of South Carolina, which advanced to the Sweet [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=276.6s)]
*  16 after a 64-53 win over Indiana University. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Greg Eklund. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=286.68s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OLCAAHbvqc&t=289.90000000000003s)]
