# White House Dismisses Issues In 'Make America Healthy Again' Report | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I)
*  The White House is dismissing criticisms of a study released by the Make America Healthy Again commission. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=0.0s)]
*  And the winner of this year's Scripps National Spelling Bee is a 13-year-old from Texas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=6.08s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  A federal appeals court has temporarily restored President Trump's ability to impose sweeping global [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=15.6s)]
*  tariffs. But as Wall Street tries to shrug off the latest tariff whiplash, NPR's Maria Aspin [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=20.64s)]
*  reports some economists say the U.S. remains at an increased risk for recession. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=25.84s)]
*  Top executives at Goldman Sachs gathered to discuss the markets, the financial industry, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  and the broader economy. Speaking hours after a federal trade court blocked the tariffs, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=36.0s)]
*  Goldman's chief economist, Jan Hatzias, said he's still worried about damage to the U.S. economy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Goldman currently predicts that the country has a 35 percent chance of tipping into a recession [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=48.32s)]
*  within the next year. We don't think this court decision really makes a major difference. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=53.6s)]
*  The president loves tariffs. Hatzias says he expects Trump to continue looking for ways to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=59.68s)]
*  impose the tariffs. Hours later, an appeals court gave them a temporary green light again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=65.84s)]
*  Maria Aspin, NPR News, Dana Point, California. President Trump will meet with a few hand-picked [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=71.76s)]
*  reporters today at the White House. He says he has asked billionaire Elon Musk to join them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=78.0s)]
*  It's Musk's last day as a special federal government employee. He has been overseeing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=83.12s)]
*  the cost-cutting entity Doge. NPR's Stephen Fowler says that Musk initially boasted he would use Doge [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=88.4s)]
*  to slash government spending by an enormous amount of money. Musk had these lofty savings goals of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=95.28s)]
*  cutting two trillion dollars from before joining the government to a fraction of that to around [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=101.68s)]
*  150 billion. Our reporting has found those claims are inaccurate, overstated, and rooted in a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=106.56s)]
*  fundamental misunderstanding of how the federal budget works. Also, Doge's other signature efforts [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=111.84s)]
*  like cutting the workforce have hit repeated legal snags, driven in part by Musk's public statements [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=116.64s)]
*  that have been used to claim those changes broke the law. NPR's Stephen Fowler reporting. Musk says [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=121.76s)]
*  he's returning to his businesses. One of them, automaker Tesla, sought sales plunge in their [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=127.36s)]
*  most recent quarter by 71 percent year over year. A report from the nonprofit news outlet, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=132.96s)]
*  Notus, is questioning the findings of a federal health report. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=139.68s)]
*  Jr. has released the study from the Make America Healthy Again commission, but the report from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Notus cites problems with this study. These include misstated findings and some of the studies the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=150.24s)]
*  commission cited apparently do not exist at all. White House press secretary Caroline Lovett is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=156.32s)]
*  dismissing criticism. We have complete confidence in secretary Kennedy and his team at HHS. I [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  understand there were some formatting issues with the Maha report that are being addressed and the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=167.44s)]
*  report will be updated, but it does not negate the substance of the report. The Notus report [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=171.92s)]
*  found the commission study also had broken web links, missing or incorrect authors, and there was [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=178.32s)]
*  an entry where the Maha report references itself as the only scientific citation. A grand jury in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=183.92s)]
*  New York has indicted a cryptocurrency investor who is now accused of kidnapping and torturing [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=190.4s)]
*  a man for weeks in Manhattan. John Waltz is accused of trying to force the victim to give [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=195.76s)]
*  up his password to his bitcoin account. A judge has denied bail for Waltz and alleged accomplice [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=201.04s)]
*  in the kidnapping has also surrendered to police. President Trump is traveling to Pittsburgh later [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=206.64s)]
*  today to celebrate a deal between U.S. Steel and the Japanese company Nippon Steel. As NPR's Tamara [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=211.84s)]
*  Keith reports, there are still a lot of missing details. When he was in office, former president [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=217.6s)]
*  Biden blocked the acquisition on national security grounds and as a candidate, Trump promised to do [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=222.8s)]
*  the same, saying a Japanese company shouldn't own the iconic American brand. But Trump has now changed [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=228.96s)]
*  his tune, announcing in a social media post last week that he supports the quote planned partnership. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=236.08s)]
*  It'll be controlled by the United States, otherwise I wouldn't make the deal. That was Trump on Sunday [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  before boarding Air Force One. He was asked about the management structure. We'll see what the final [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=247.6s)]
*  is, but they're going to invest millions of dollars in steel and it's a good company. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=253.28s)]
*  More details may come at today's rally. Tamara Keith, NPR News. The aid situation remains dire [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=258.64s)]
*  in Gaza. A U.S.-Israeli-backed effort to provide some limited aid to Palestinians in southern Gaza [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=266.32s)]
*  is mired in chaos. Yesterday, the U.S.-backed group handing out aid only opened one site to offer [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=273.28s)]
*  limited amounts of food. This effort is coming as Israel continues to bomb sites in Gaza. No aid [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=280.24s)]
*  is being sent to northern Gaza. Harvard University can continue enrolling international students. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  That's after a federal judge temporarily stopped the Trump administration yesterday from trying to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=292.64s)]
*  block them. NPR's Alyssa Nadwarni reports. Harvard has nearly 7,000 international students, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=297.52s)]
*  about a quarter of the entire student body. Ella Ricketts, a first-year student from Canada, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=302.88s)]
*  was hesitant to call this order a victory. Until that case is actually won, I don't necessarily [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=308.24s)]
*  feel 100% safe with everything that's going on. Obviously, I remain optimistic and hopeful, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=315.6s)]
*  but this is very much just one step in a much, much larger process. After the judge's order, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=323.28s)]
*  the White House told NPR that the Trump administration, not judges, has final say over [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=329.2s)]
*  whether or not universities can issue student visas. Alyssa Nadwarni, NPR News. President Trump [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=334.56s)]
*  has commuted the federal life sentences of a former Chicago gang leader. Larry Hoover founded [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=341.36s)]
*  the Gangster Disciples. For Member Station WBEZ, Anna Sovchenko has more. In the 1990s, Hoover was [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=347.28s)]
*  given six life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, drug conspiracy, and other criminal charges. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=354.48s)]
*  Former federal prosecutor Ron Safer led the Gangster Disciples prosecution. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=360.56s)]
*  He told the Chicago Sun-Times commuting Hoover's life sentence was an injustice. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  I do not understand why Hoover among all of the people in federal custody is worthy of this result. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=369.6s)]
*  But Hoover isn't free. He still faces a 200-year jail term in Illinois for murder. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=382.8s)]
*  It's unclear if the Illinois governor will be willing to commute his sentence. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=388.16s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Anna Sovchenko in Chicago. This year's winner of the Scripps National Spelling Bee [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=392.64s)]
*  is 13-year-old Faison Zaki of Dallas, Texas. And here is Faison's championship moment. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=399.2s)]
*  Your word is éclaircissement. E-C-L-A-I-R-C-I-S-S-E-M-E-N-T. That is correct. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=406.72s)]
*  Faison Zaki was last year's runner-up. He now wins a medal, a trophy, and a $50,000 prize. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman, NPR News, from Washington. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BFangGq86I&t=434.8s)]
