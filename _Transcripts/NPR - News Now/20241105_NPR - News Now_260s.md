# After Early Voters Shatter Records, Millions More Vote Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g)
*  While the number of people who voted early for the general election set new records, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=0.0s)]
*  millions more plan to cast their ballots today, and the presidential candidates wrapped up [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=4.72s)]
*  their campaigns in key swing states last night. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=9.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  It is election day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  At last, officials say that the number of people who voted early in person for the general [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=17.72s)]
*  election has shattered records nationally. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=22.06s)]
*  But as NPR's Miles Parks reports, many people still vote on the first Tuesday of November. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=25.0s)]
*  Close to 80 million voters are expected to cast ballots today, and any time that many [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=30.16s)]
*  people are doing the same thing on the same day, there will be hiccups. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=34.36s)]
*  Whether it's power outages or websites crashing, experts say it's important to realize those [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=38.24s)]
*  are expected and not assume it means the process is rigged. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=42.42s)]
*  Kentucky's Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams notes this is, after all, a process [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=46.36s)]
*  run by human beings. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=51.08s)]
*  Most of my counties, people go to church with the poll workers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=52.72s)]
*  They go to church with the county clerk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  They see them at the grocery, right? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=57.16s)]
*  Like, it's harder to accuse people of being crooks and stealing elections when you know [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=58.64s)]
*  them and you see them every day. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=63.68s)]
*  It could take officials a few days to tally enough votes to know who won the presidency. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=64.8s)]
*  Miles Parks, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=69.36s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump campaigned in several swing states yesterday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=72.2s)]
*  He started his very last rally after midnight this morning in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=75.78s)]
*  This is it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  This is the last one that we're going to have to do. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  This is the third time Trump has closed out his presidential campaign in Grand Rapids. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=85.4s)]
*  He spoke for about two hours this morning, castigating the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  Vice President Harris rallied for the last time in Philadelphia last night. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaram has more. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=98.92s)]
*  Harris's campaign says her rally in Philadelphia had 30,000 people, and the location was at [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=100.84s)]
*  the famous Rocky Steps outside the art museum that has the statue of the iconic movie character [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=106.24s)]
*  Rocky. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  A tribute to those who start as the underdog and climb to victory. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  Harris told the crowd that Pennsylvania will decide the election. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=119.6s)]
*  On her way out of Philadelphia, when asked if she's confident if she'll win, she said [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=123.32s)]
*  her campaign is encouraging people to vote on election day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=127.46s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News, Philadelphia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=131.16s)]
*  Also at stake in this election is control of the U.S. Senate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=134.04s)]
*  That's where Democrats currently hold a narrow 51 to 49 majority. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=137.16s)]
*  But Republicans are favored for a takeover. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=141.6s)]
*  NPR's Susan Davis explains that's because the map tilts dramatically in the GOP's favor. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Of the 33 U.S. Senate seats up for election this year, Republicans are defending just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  10, while Democrats are defending 23. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=154.64s)]
*  To tip the balance of power in their favor, Republicans need to win just two of three [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=158.11999999999998s)]
*  conservative states, Montana, Ohio and West Virginia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=162.16s)]
*  The two parties are also contesting close races in the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=166.24s)]
*  Michigan and Pennsylvania, where the Senate races tend to fall in line with the presidential [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=170.72s)]
*  outcome. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=174.92s)]
*  Democrats are defending seats in Nevada and Arizona, where they've had the edge in polls. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=176.4s)]
*  There are only two Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats are trying to flip, Texas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=180.84s)]
*  and Florida, but both are seen as long shots. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=184.76s)]
*  Susan Davis, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=187.56s)]
*  A man who successfully challenged a federal ban on bump stocks is getting back his gun [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=189.56s)]
*  enhancement devices. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=194.6s)]
*  Michael Cargill spent more than five years challenging the Trump-era ban and finally [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=196.28s)]
*  prevailed in the Supreme Court last June. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=200.6s)]
*  NPR's Nita Totenberg reports it took until this week for a federal court to carry out [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=203.76s)]
*  the high court's mandate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  President Trump ordered the ban on bump stocks in 2017 after a single gunman at a Las Vegas [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=210.28s)]
*  concert used multiple guns modified by bump stock devices to kill 60 people and injure [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  400, all in the space of 11 minutes. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=222.6s)]
*  President Trump then ordered the ATF to re-examine whether bump stocks violated the 1934 banning [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=226.16s)]
*  machine guns, and the federal agency concluded that the devices illegally converted semi-automatic [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=232.48s)]
*  weapons into illegal machine guns. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=238.67999999999998s)]
*  The Supreme Court's conservative supermajority disagreed, saying the ATF had exceeded its [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  authority. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=247.32s)]
*  Now, a federal judge has ordered the agency that seized the devices to return them to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=248.32s)]
*  Mr. Cargill. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=253.08s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=254.08s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HykFhZ_kU8g&t=257.32s)]
