*  and President Biden's son, Hunter, is expected to appear [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=3.16s)]
*  in federal court in Delaware today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Kori Voekelmann from NPR News, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=8.48s)]
*  and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=10.8s)]
*  Forecasters say dangerous heat conditions [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  are spreading in the central plains. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=15.14s)]
*  Heat advisories are up from central Texas to Ohio. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=16.92s)]
*  Heat indexes will be well into the triple digits. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=20.48s)]
*  Battalion Chief Michael Hopkins [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=23.56s)]
*  is with the Kansas City, Missouri Fire Department. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=25.28s)]
*  He warns that everyone is at risk of heat exhaustion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=27.96s)]
*  Doesn't matter what kind of shape you're in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  I mean, there are certain people, like I said, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  the elderly and very young that are more susceptible, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=35.04s)]
*  but the heat can get to anyone. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=37.44s)]
*  The city of Phoenix has now had 26 straight days [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=39.040000000000006s)]

*  President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  is expected to appear in federal court in Delaware today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  the younger Biden struck a plea deal [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=56.88s)]
*  with the Justice Department last month [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=58.88s)]
*  after a lengthy investigation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  Hunter Biden is expected to plead guilty [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=62.52s)]
*  to two misdemeanor tax crimes [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=64.92s)]
*  during today's court appearance. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=66.86s)]
*  The hearing is also expected to address an agreement [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=68.64s)]
*  between federal prosecutors and Biden [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  to avert prosecution on a felony charge [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=73.94s)]
*  of illegally possessing a firearm. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=76.88s)]
*  Hunter Biden's plea deal with prosecutors [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=79.68s)]
*  has outraged House Republicans [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=81.88s)]
*  who have criticized the agreement as a slap on the wrist. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=84.12s)]
*  In the meantime, the chairman of three House committees [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=87.92s)]
*  have requested testimony [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=90.36s)]
*  from nearly a dozen officials at the DOJ. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=91.78s)]
*  The department informed the House Judiciary Committee [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=94.84s)]
*  on Monday that US Attorney David Weiss, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=97.22s)]
*  who's been leading the federal investigation into Biden, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=99.72s)]
*  will appear for a public hearing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=104.64s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy suggests [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=106.48s)]
*  he's moving closer to opening an impeachment inquiry [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=108.64s)]
*  into President Biden. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=111.94s)]
*  The speaker says there needs to be an investigation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=113.4s)]
*  into alleged financial improprieties involving Biden [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  and his son Hunter. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Democrats say there is no evidence of this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  and McCarthy did not provide any. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=123.0s)]
*  This fall, Ohio voters will consider [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=125.48s)]
*  a proposed constitutional amendment. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=127.76s)]
*  It would enshrine abortion rights [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  in the state constitution. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  Ohio Public Radio's Joe Ingalls reports [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  the measure has just qualified for the November ballot. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=136.32s)]
*  Ohio's proposed constitutional amendment [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=139.32s)]
*  is similar to the one that Michigan adopted last year. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=142.32s)]
*  Kelly Copeland with the coalition behind Ohio's measure [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=146.84s)]
*  says they have nearly 500,000 valid signatures [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=150.16s)]
*  from voters who want guaranteed rights to abortion, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=153.42s)]
*  not the six-week ban that's on hold now [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  but could be reinstated. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=160.16s)]
*  So that we never have to go back [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=161.92s)]
*  to where we were a year ago. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=163.88s)]
*  But before voters here can cast ballots [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=166.24s)]
*  on the abortion amendment, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=168.92s)]
*  they'll have to vote in August on a change [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=170.36s)]
*  that could make it harder [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  to pass future constitutional amendments [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=173.84s)]
*  by requiring a 60% threshold instead of a simple majority. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=176.4s)]
*  Early voting is underway now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=181.24s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Joe Ingalls in Columbus, Ohio. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXAz4u0ZQxk&t=183.44000000000003s)]
