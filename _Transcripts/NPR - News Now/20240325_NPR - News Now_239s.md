# 4 Charged In Attack On A Moscow-Area Concert Hall | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE)
*  Four men have been charged as suspects in last Friday's attack on a Moscow area concert [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=0.0s)]
*  hall. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=4.96s)]
*  And Wyoming has joined nearly two dozen other states in banning gender-affirming care for [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=5.96s)]
*  minors. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=10.36s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=11.36s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=12.36s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=13.9s)]
*  Israel's defense minister is in Washington today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=15.76s)]
*  He's asking the Biden administration for more weapons for Israel's offensive in Gaza and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=18.16s)]
*  potential war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=22.48s)]
*  But some Democratic lawmakers are urging President Biden to withhold military aid because of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=25.2s)]
*  Israeli restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=29.98s)]
*  NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=33.46s)]
*  Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Galant is meeting Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=36.26s)]
*  and other top U.S. officials. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=39.74s)]
*  He says he'll seek to preserve Israel's ability to obtain munitions as Israel presses on with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=41.68s)]
*  its goal to defeat Hamas and Gaza and to prepare for potential war with Hezbollah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=46.22s)]
*  But the rift between the Biden administration and Israel is widening. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=51.66s)]
*  The U.S. opposes Israel's plans for a military offensive in Rafah, where more than a million [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=55.24s)]
*  people are sheltering. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=59.96s)]
*  It says Israel needs to do more to allow aid into Gaza where there's extreme hunger. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=61.32s)]
*  Groups of Democratic senators and House representatives have written to President Biden that Israel [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  is not complying with a U.S. law that requires Israel, as a recipient of military aid, not [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=71.08s)]
*  to restrict the delivery of humanitarian aid. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=76.14s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Russian authorities have charged four men as suspects in last Friday's terror attack [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=81.24s)]
*  on a Moscow-area concert hall that killed at least 137 people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=85.28s)]
*  The suspects all pleaded guilty in court, but NPR's Charles Means says they showed signs [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  of duress and torture. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=94.96s)]
*  One of the accused was brought in a wheelchair, not even conscious. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=96.88s)]
*  Another showed up with a bandage on his ear after his interrogator cut off a portion of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=100.44s)]
*  it with a knife. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  We know because the authorities released a video. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=105.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, others had swollen faces with bruises and cuts, so taking all of that into account, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=107.8s)]
*  there certainly will be those who question the confessions they gave. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Charles Means reporting. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=116.0s)]
*  An affiliate of ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Moscow attack, but the Kremlin insists, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=118.12s)]
*  without proof, that Ukraine was involved. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=123.76s)]
*  Ukraine denies this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  Wyoming Republican Governor Mark Gordon has signed a law banning gender-affirming medical [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=128.28s)]
*  care for minors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=133.12s)]
*  Wyoming Public Radio's Chris Clements reports the state joins nearly two dozen others with [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=134.76s)]
*  similar bans. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=139.6s)]
*  The ban outlaws gender-affirming surgeries for Wyoming youth even though those surgeries [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  aren't performed in the state. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=145.6s)]
*  It also bans other forms of gender-affirming care that physicians broadly agree can be [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  crucial to helping an already vulnerable population. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=151.68s)]
*  Brittany Brown is an administrator at a clinic in Casper that provides trans patients with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=155.0s)]
*  some kinds of gender-affirming care. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Here she is before the decision was handed down. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  It's so ironic to me that in the same session that passed a bill affirming parent rights, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=164.36s)]
*  they now want to step in and say, but not that one, all the rights except the one about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  your child's medical care. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=175.28s)]
*  It's possible that Wyoming's ban could face a court challenge similar to other states [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=176.68s)]
*  like Oklahoma, where a ban has been appealed to the 10th Circuit. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=180.68s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Chris Clements in Laramie. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=184.38000000000002s)]
*  They're down to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=187.24s)]
*  Pierre's Becky Sullivan reports. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=192.12s)]
*  In the men's tournament, all four 1-seeds and all four 2-seeds have made it out of the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=194.24s)]
*  opening weekend. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  That includes top seeds Connecticut, Purdue, North Carolina, and Houston, who survived [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  a Sunday night overtime thriller to advance. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  It's the first time since 2019 that the top eight teams have all gotten this far. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=206.44s)]
*  Upsets have gotten more common in recent years, but this tournament has bucked that trend. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=210.44s)]
*  The only team left seeded lower than six is North Carolina State, an 11-seed. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  In the women's event, top overall team South Carolina has won both their games by about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  50 points on route to the Sweet 16. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=222.68s)]
*  There they'll be joined by fellow 1-seed Texas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=225.4s)]
*  The other two top seeds, Iowa and USC, each play on Monday night for their shot at advancing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=228.16s)]
*  Becky Sullivan, NPR News. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xvH2uwO5XE&t=233.52s)]
