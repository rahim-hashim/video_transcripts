*  And a new doping scandal has erupted less than 100 days before the Summer Games in Paris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=6.5s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Kristen Wright with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=12.3s)]
*  Prosecutors in New York will begin laying out their case against former President Donald Trump in opening statements today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=16.7s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Bernstein reports the case stems from the final weeks of the 2016 presidential race and an alleged affair. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=24.3s)]
*  In October of 2016, right before Election Day, not long after the Access Hollywood tape became public, the campaign is in a panic. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=33.900000000000006s)]

*  Israeli media quote the Prime Minister is accusing members of his negotiating team of conducting false briefings that he said are seeding desperation among the families of the hostages. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=81.6s)]
*  The Discord comes after two Israeli news channels quoted unnamed members of the negotiating team as saying the Prime Minister appeared to be indifferent to the fate of the hostages and his undermined efforts to win their release. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=91.1s)]

*  They say the exposure was accidental, but they never reported the findings to sports officials from other countries. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=158.7s)]

*  They haven't addressed why no provisional suspensions were put in place, why no announcement was made. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJtBlwpav10&t=169.7s)]
