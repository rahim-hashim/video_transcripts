# 9 Dead After Stage Collapses At Mexican Political Rally | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to blast three European countries' [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=0.0s)]
*  decision to recognize a Palestinian state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=6.62s)]
*  And Arizona's Senate has passed controversial new immigration legislation. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=10.82s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=16.14s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=17.14s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is continuing to lambast the announcement [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=21.86s)]
*  by three European countries to recognize a Palestinian state. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=27.78s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports Netanyahu is calling the decision a quote, reward for terrorism. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=32.86s)]
*  Spain, Norway and Ireland have said they will recognize a state of Palestine, a move those [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=40.5s)]
*  countries leaders said was a step forward in the Middle East peace process. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=46.02s)]
*  But Netanyahu, along with several other key lawmakers in Israel, saw it very differently. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=50.5s)]
*  In a video released Wednesday night, Netanyahu said that a Palestinian state would be quote, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  a terrorist state that would try to repeat the same events of October 7th. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=63.14s)]
*  A prize for terrorism will not bring peace, he said. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=68.02s)]
*  Israel has recalled its ambassadors from those three countries. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=72.18s)]
*  Kat Lonsdorf, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=75.22s)]
*  Controversial immigration legislation has advanced in the Arizona Senate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=78.22s)]
*  Wayne Chudsky from Member Station KJZZ reports if the measure passes the House, it will go [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=83.06s)]
*  directly to voters in November. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=89.5s)]
*  The measure would make it a state crime to cross the state's border with Mexico illegally. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=92.5s)]
*  That's already illegal federally but not locally enforceable. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=96.58s)]
*  Republicans like Senate President Warren Peterson say the measure is needed to secure the border [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=99.7s)]
*  and combat crimes like drug and human trafficking. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=103.7s)]
*  How safe will this country be? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=106.62s)]
*  How prosperous will this country be? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=109.18s)]
*  If we do not enforce our laws, it won't be. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=111.26s)]
*  Republicans modified the proposal to remove sections critics said would target people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=115.5s)]
*  with DACA status brought to the country as children. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  But Senate Democrats argued the proposal will still result in racial profiling by law enforcement. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=122.14s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Wayne Chudsky in Phoenix. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=126.9s)]
*  At least nine people were killed after a stage collapsed at a political rally in Mexico last night. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=129.78s)]
*  The accident occurred at a campaign event for Mexican presidential candidate Jorge Alvarez [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=136.78s)]
*  Maynez. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=143.22s)]
*  Videos on social media show people trying to climb out from under metal poles after [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=144.22s)]
*  the stage went down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=149.7s)]
*  British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced the next general election in the United Kingdom [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=151.94s)]
*  will take place on July 4. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=157.66s)]
*  Villamarks reports Sunak's party is behind in the polls and his opponents have repeatedly [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=160.3s)]
*  pushed to hold a vote. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=166.26s)]
*  While making the announcement, Sunak said he arrived in office to stabilize Britain's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  economy, but he struggled to highlight his achievements since 2022 as nearby protesters [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=171.34s)]
*  sarcastically played a song called Things Can Only Get Better. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=175.45999999999998s)]
*  I hope my work as prime minister shows that we have a plan, Sunak said, insisting he'd [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=178.66s)]
*  take difficult decisions unlike his opponents, the Labour Party. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=182.89999999999998s)]
*  His conservatives trailed them by 20 points in national polls. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  That's Villamarks reporting from London. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=189.78s)]
*  A very different kind of airline will begin operating today. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=192.74s)]
*  Its target flyer, dogs. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=197.74s)]
*  The carrier dubbed Bark Air says its motto is that no dog should fly in a crate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=200.3s)]
*  Reporter Steve Futterman has more. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=207.46s)]
*  Matt Meeker is the CEO of Bark Air. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  We've tried to build an experience for the dog that is as low anxiety and low stress [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  as possible. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=218.46s)]
*  The initial plan is to have one flight each way each week between New York and Los Angeles, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=219.72s)]
*  every other week between New York and London. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=225.48s)]
*  Each dog must be accompanied by a person. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=228.04s)]
*  Information is gathered about the dog before the flight. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=230.8s)]
*  They are an experienced flyer. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=234.44s)]
*  They're anxious. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=236.52s)]
*  They get along well with other dogs. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=237.52s)]
*  The first flights will be on smaller private Gulfstream jets, only 10 dogs per flight. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=239.64s)]
*  And it isn't cheap. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  $6,000 each way for the LA flights, $8,000 for the London flights. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=246.44s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2olq9LA2D8&t=251.6s)]
