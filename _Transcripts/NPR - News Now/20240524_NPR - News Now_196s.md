*  In the early stages of the war, Israel's military went systematically from the north [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9rdyZQFApk&t=34.2s)]

*  meeting room was so packed with people the air conditioning couldn't keep up. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9rdyZQFApk&t=123.53999999999999s)]
