**NPR - News Now:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U)
*  Two candidates are vying to be the next speaker of the House, and former President Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump is backing one of them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=4.5s)]
*  And thousands of health care workers remain on strike against Kaiser Permanente. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=6.7s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=11.1s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=12.1s)]
*  It's still unclear who will be the next speaker of the House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=15.92s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump initially floated the idea of temporarily filling the Post himself. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=18.6s)]
*  Now he says he's backing Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=23.76s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports the other contender for the speakership is Louisiana's Steve Scalise. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=26.96s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise are rushing to lock down the more centrist members [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=32.56s)]
*  of the conference ahead of a vote that's expected to take place next Wednesday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=37.6s)]
*  Jordan, the chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee and a fierce defender of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=41.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, has pitched himself to his fellow Republicans as someone who can unify the party [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=46.2s)]
*  going forward. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Majority leader Scalise has argued that he has the experience needed to unite the conference, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=52.8s)]
*  having served as part of the House Republican leadership team for the past 10 years. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=58.68s)]
*  In order to become the next speaker, any candidate will need a simple majority of the House members [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=63.28s)]
*  who are present and voting. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=68.14s)]
*  Historically, that number has been 218. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=70.08s)]

*  Last November, when the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed, Paradigm marked down that investment [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=109.28s)]

*  guilty to wire fraud, securities fraud, and commodities fraud charges. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=119.8s)]

*  the country. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=140.36s)]
*  They're demanding better wages, and they're calling on Kaiser to immediately address a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=141.52s)]
*  significant staffing shortage in its facilities. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XExHaNNs2_U&t=145.56s)]
