# Trump Signs A Flurry Of Orders On His First Day In Office | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI)
*  President Trump has pardoned about 1,500 people convicted or accused of participating in the attack on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Trump has again withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=7.18s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Cora Vick-Holman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=11.68s)]
*  President Trump has been in office for less than 24 hours and he has already signed scores of executive orders and actions. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=16.18s)]
*  That includes pardons for about 1,500 people convicted of or accused of participating in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=22.68s)]
*  NPR's Tom Dreisbach has more. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=31.08s)]
*  Almost every single defendant got a full unconditional pardon. That means their conviction is forgiven. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=33.08s)]
*  If they're locked up, they get released. If they were convicted of a felony, they get their gun rights back. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=38.92s)]
*  And that group includes more than 400 people charged or convicted of violent assaults on law enforcement, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  driving a stun gun into an officer's necks, for example, beating officers with a bat. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=49.92s)]
*  And then just 14 people are getting these commutations. So they still have a felony on the record, but they are getting out of prison. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=55.04s)]
*  NPR's Tom Dreisbach reporting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=62.08s)]
*  President Trump has declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=64.4s)]
*  NPR's Sergio Martinez Beltran reports Trump wants additional funding and resources for border security. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  President Trump's executive order calls for the deployment of armed forces, including the National Guard, to the southern border. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=74.72s)]
*  The order says it's needed to obtain, quote, complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=81.52s)]
*  Trump is also asking the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to continue building barriers at the border [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=88.0s)]
*  and to secure detention space and transportation for the immigration enforcement operations. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=94.16s)]
*  It's important to note that Trump is inheriting a relatively quiet border. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=99.76s)]
*  Although it's true that unauthorized crossings hit an all time high in 2023 during the Biden administration, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=104.0s)]
*  that number has sharply dropped to COVID era figures, in part due to Biden's asylum restrictions at the border. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=109.76s)]
*  Sergio Martinez Beltran, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=116.64s)]
*  Among the other executive actions, President Trump has signed an order to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Julia Simon has more. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=126.56s)]
*  Trump pulled the U.S. out of the climate treaty in his last term. This time he did it on his first day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=128.72s)]
*  Almost a decade ago, 196 countries came together to sign the historic treaty. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=133.52s)]
*  The goal remains to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over levels in the 1800s. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=139.28s)]
*  Scientists agree that with ever increasing levels of climate pollution, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  the world will see more devastating heat waves, floods, and fires. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=149.68s)]
*  Trump's decision comes on the heels of deadly fires in Los Angeles that scientists already say were made worse [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=153.68s)]
*  because climate change made vegetation more dry. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Climate experts say as the U.S. retreats from climate leadership, other countries are stepping up, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  including China, the U.K., and the European Union. Julia Simon, NPR News. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=169.6s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports many of the executive actions are in line with Trump's campaign promises. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=174.08s)]
*  Trump wasted no time implementing the conservative agenda that he's repeatedly promised. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=179.84s)]
*  Tim Naftali is a senior research scholar at Columbia University. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=185.68s)]
*  He says the executive actions are meant to be seen as a major flex of presidential power. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=190.08s)]
*  It's a very dramatic way of achieving the goal. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  The first day in power he would demonstrate his control of the government and be the public's dictator, if you will. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=199.36s)]
*  That, I think, is the theater that he's seeking. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=206.0s)]
*  Naftali says how the executive actions will take shape will depend on the nature of the orders. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  He says many of them will be met with legal challenges, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=214.96s)]
*  including the ones that relate to border security and immigration. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=218.16s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  One Trump executive action seeks to cancel birthright citizenship, but that is protected by the U.S. Constitution. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  The ACLU is suing over the issue. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=232.16s)]
*  A blast of Arctic air is layered over the Central and Eastern U.S. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=235.12s)]
*  There are extreme cold warnings posted from the Canadian border down to Texas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  There are also winter storm warnings from southern Texas all the way to South Carolina. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=244.16s)]
*  NPR's Debbie Elliott reports the rare winter storm is prompting emergency preparation along the Gulf Coast. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=249.04s)]
*  Forecasters predict frigid temperatures and historic snowfall in the Gulf South, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=255.6s)]
*  five to eight inches in New Orleans, for instance, and up to three inches in Houston and in Mobile, Alabama. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=261.68s)]
*  Places including beaches that almost never get snow. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=268.64s)]
*  Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has declared a state of emergency. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=272.56s)]
*  We may have over 48 hours of constant below freezing temperatures, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=276.72s)]
*  along with extremely cold wind chills and what could possibly be near record amounts of snowfall in South Louisiana. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=282.0s)]
*  This creates a very dangerous situation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=291.68s)]
*  He's urging people to avoid travel and prepare for possible water and power outages. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=295.2s)]
*  Debbie Elliott, NPR News. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=301.2s)]
*  There are two new wildfires that broke out overnight in southern California. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=303.52s)]
*  These are north of San Diego. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=308.4s)]
*  The Lilac fire has already burned at least 50 acres. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=310.4s)]
*  The Pala fire has scorched at least 30 acres. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  Both fires have triggered evacuations. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=317.44s)]
*  They're fueled by winds that could gust up to 70 miles per hour today. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=320.0s)]
*  The winds could also affect two deadly wildfires around Los Angeles that are not yet fully contained. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=324.64s)]
*  I'm Korva Kuhlman, NPR News from Washington. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDWmEhKWXHI&t=331.2s)]
