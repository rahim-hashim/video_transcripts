**NPR - News Now:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo)
*  Former President Donald Trump says he's been indicted in connection with his handling of classified documents. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=0.0s)]
*  And air quality is improving in the Northeast as smoke from Canada's wildfires shifts. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=13.8s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump says he's been indicted by the Justice Department over his handling of classified documents. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  In a post on social media last night, Trump declared himself innocent and pledged to fight back against the charges. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=27.0s)]
*  NPR's Carrie Johnson reports Trump is the first former president to face criminal charges from a government he once led. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=34.2s)]
*  Trump's lawyers say the indictment contains seven charges. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=42.2s)]
*  They include willful retention of information related to the national defense, part of the Espionage Act, and obstruction and false statements charges. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=45.7s)]
*  The former president's due in court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Special counsel Jack Smith isn't commenting on the indictment. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=58.2s)]
*  The Justice Department probe began last year after Trump allegedly refused to return sensitive documents he had stored at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=61.7s)]
*  This is the second time Trump has been indicted this year. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=70.4s)]
*  He's fighting separate charges in Manhattan. Carrie Johnson, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=73.2s)]
*  Air quality is improving today for many in the northeastern United States as a dense plume of smoke from Canadian wildfires eases and shifts. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=78.1s)]
*  But as NPR's Amy Held reports, other parts of the U.S. are not out of the woods. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=88.8s)]
*  The thick haze that circled and settled on much of the northeast this week, disrupting life and making breathing a hazard, is dispersing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=94.3s)]
*  David Roth is a forecaster with the Weather Prediction Center. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=102.3s)]
*  In New York City, they'll be completely out of it by the time we get later today and tonight. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=105.5s)]
*  The air is still dangerously smoky in parts. Philadelphia has canceled in-person school today. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=111.0s)]
*  Portions of Delaware, Maryland, southern Pennsylvania, and parts of Ohio, there could be obvious concentrations of smoke into this evening. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=116.3s)]
*  The smoke is moving westward with air quality alerts extending as far as Indianapolis. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=126.8s)]
*  And the source? Hundreds of Canadian wildfires are still burning out of control. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=132.0s)]
*  Amy Held, NPR News. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=137.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian military continues to fight back against Russian forces on a number of fronts. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=139.0s)]
*  There are reports of heavy fighting in the Zaporizhzhia area of Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=145.0s)]
*  Military experts say the region will be the focus of Ukraine's long-awaited counteroffensive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=150.0s)]
*  The BBC's Paul Adams has more. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=156.0s)]
*  There's a lot of images appearing showing armored Ukrainian units, some of them using leopard tanks, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=159.0s)]
*  which was obviously one of the principal requests and demands of the Ukrainians from their western backers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=166.0s)]
*  Those leopard tanks do now seem to be in action on the battlefront south of the city of Zaporizhzhia. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=172.0s)]
*  What the Ukrainians are doing is they are probing forward in a number of directions against what are very heavily fortified Russian lines. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=179.0s)]
*  The BBC's Paul Adams reporting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=187.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEwi-JyAwzo&t=190.0s)]
