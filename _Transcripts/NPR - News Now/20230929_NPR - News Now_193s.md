# White House: It's Up To Republicans To Avert Shutdown | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY)
*  The White House chief of staff tells NPR it's on Republicans to avert a looming government shutdown [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=0.0s)]
*  and bans on gender-affirming care for minors in Tennessee and Kentucky are being allowed to go into effect. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=12.5s)]
*  The White House insists the government should not shut down this weekend and that it would not if House Republicans did their jobs. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=17.0s)]
*  But as NPR's Asma Khalid reports, the Biden administration is working on contingency plans. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=24.0s)]
*  The Office of Management and Budget is coordinating with federal agencies to ensure there's a plan in place if the government shuts down on Sunday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=29.5s)]
*  The White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, told NPR the president expects Congress to do the quote, right thing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=37.5s)]
*  And if we get into the unfortunate situation, which we should not, of the government shutting down, then the president will communicate with the American people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=44.5s)]
*  Zients noted a shutdown would have a big impact. Small business loans and FEMA recovery efforts would be stalled. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=52.5s)]
*  Active troops and air traffic controllers would not get paychecks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=58.5s)]
*  But the main message from this White House is that there was a deal struck months ago to fund the government [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=62.5s)]
*  and House Republicans need to keep their end of the bargain. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=67.5s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=70.5s)]
*  The United Auto Workers could increase the number of automotive facilities they're striking today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=72.5s)]
*  The union has said it wants to see more progress in contract talks with the big three U.S. automakers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=78.5s)]
*  Transgender children in Tennessee and Kentucky will no longer be able to access gender-affirming care. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=84.5s)]
*  A federal court has ruled both states can enforce bans on their care while respective lawsuits go through the courts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=91.5s)]
*  From member station WPLN, Mariana Bacallao has more. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=97.5s)]
*  The ruling from the Sixth Circuit is temporary, as both states deal with legal challenges to laws preventing trans kids from accessing treatment like hormone therapy and puberty blockers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=102.5s)]
*  And a similar ban being considered in Ohio, also in the Sixth Circuit, now has a more clear path forward. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=113.5s)]
*  That worries plaintiff Samantha Williams, who had been looking into crossing state borders to get care for her trans daughter. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=121.5s)]
*  The two states where we were looking to go for care if the injunction wasn't granted now have bills of their own. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=128.5s)]
*  The ruling puts the issue of gender-affirming care one step closer to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=136.5s)]
*  As courts have blocked similar bans in other states from taking effect. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=141.5s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Mariana Bacallao in Nashville. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=146.5s)]
*  Officials in New York City say they've arrested a drug suspect. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=150.5s)]
*  They allege he carried about 30 pounds of fentanyl in a rolling suitcase onto a city subway. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=154.5s)]
*  Frank Tarantino is with the Drug Enforcement Administration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=160.5s)]
*  It is the most reckless and most irresponsible thing that traffickers could do is move this poison on the public transportation system. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=164.5s)]
*  Officers found more fentanyl in the suspect's New York City apartment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=174.5s)]
*  This happened just blocks away from another drug bust last week. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=178.5s)]
*  A one-year-old baby died after being exposed to the drug in his apartment-based daycare. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=183.5s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4KYjcBGOY&t=189.5s)]
