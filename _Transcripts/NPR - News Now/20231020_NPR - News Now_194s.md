*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfBEChuF3rc&t=12.42s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfBEChuF3rc&t=13.42s)]
*  Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan is pushing ahead with his bid to become Speaker of the House. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfBEChuF3rc&t=17.68s)]
*  He's failed twice this week, and he lost more Republican lawmakers in the second round of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfBEChuF3rc&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  voting than he did in the first. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfBEChuF3rc&t=26.62s)]
