*  visit is only the second trip to Africa by a US president in a decade. It concludes efforts by [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=27.28s)]
*  the Biden administration to improve its ties in Africa and to counter the growing influence of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=32.56s)]
*  China and Russia. But the visit comes less than two months before the president leaves office, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=37.28s)]
*  which some analysts say reflects Africa's low priority in US foreign policy. In Angola, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  Biden will meet President Jau Lorenzo and will visit the National Slavery Museum. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=47.84s)]

*  hold with the European Union. The government indeed said it won't engage with the EU until [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=91.28s)]
*  2028. As to why, the answer lies in recent parliamentary elections. An October vote [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  in Georgia saw the ruling Georgian Dream Party claim victory with some 54 percent of all ballots, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  result that was certified, by the way, by the election commission. The only the opposition [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  argues those results were rigged. And as of last week, the European Parliament agreed they were [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=112.8s)]
*  calling down for a do-over. NPR's Charles Maines reporting. The White House says President Biden [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=118.16s)]

*  Corrine Jean-Pierre says the president believed there was a quote miscarriage of justice in the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  process. Hunter was singled out and because he his last name was Biden, because he was the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=149.84s)]
*  president's son, that's what we saw. The pardon shields Hunter Biden from any further prosecution [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  by the Justice Department for anything he might have done in the last 10 years. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=162.72s)]

*  There are winter storm watches and warnings today for Michigan as well. Meanwhile, climate change is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=183.12s)]
*  heating the whole earth up, but a new study maps out some places where heat waves are getting even [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=189.12s)]
*  worse than scientists thought they could be. NPR's Alejandro Barunda has more. In 2021, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=195.04s)]
*  the Pacific Northwest baked under a record-breaking heat dome that killed [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=200.72s)]
*  hundreds of people. It was so intense, people didn't believe the weather forecasts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=204.4s)]
*  It turns out that most climate models weren't able to capture its intensity either. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=209.44s)]
*  The new study finds that climate models routinely underestimate how bad heat waves can get in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=214.24s)]
*  some specific parts of the world. These so-called hot spots like Northern Europe and Southern [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=218.96s)]
*  Australia are getting worse heat waves than models predict. The authors of the study, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=223.52s)]
*  which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  say it's a problem that climate models aren't capturing the true risks of climate change. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w31i3THD2sw&t=232.0s)]
