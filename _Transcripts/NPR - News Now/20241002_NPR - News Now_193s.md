# Biden, Harris To Visit States Damaged By Helene | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4)
*  President Biden will visit the Carolinas today to assess damage from Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=0.0s)]
*  And the vice presidential candidate has held their one and only debate of this campaign season last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=5.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=11.0s)]
*  President Biden will visit North and South Carolina today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=15.4s)]
*  And Vice President Harris will go to Georgia to view storm recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=18.2s)]
*  More than 160 people have been killed by the storm in the southeast. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=23.1s)]
*  NPR's Nathan Rott reports that in western North Carolina's mountains, storm damage is severe. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=27.4s)]
*  Volunteers pull waterlogged paneling off the interior of a brewery in the town of Hot Springs [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=34.8s)]
*  while others pile ruined mud-covered merchandise outside. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=39.6s)]
*  For an exhausted Chris Donishod, the store's owner says he hopes they'll be able to recover. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=43.8s)]
*  But we had two foot of moving water through both buildings and essentially a class four rapid through town. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=49.2s)]
*  He's lucky he has insurance for the buildings, he says. Many other businesses in town do not. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=57.0s)]
*  Nathan Rott, NPR News, Hot Springs, North Carolina. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=63.8s)]
*  The vice presidential candidate has held their only scheduled debate last night. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=66.6s)]
*  The cordial event between Republican J.D. Vance and Democrat Tim Walz touched on several issues, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=70.0s)]
*  including how to protect U.S. jobs. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=75.8s)]
*  Vance says former President Donald Trump's plan to increase tariffs on foreign goods coming into the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=78.6s)]
*  will protect American jobs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=84.4s)]
*  Penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=86.4s)]
*  That's the heart of the economic proposal. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=90.4s)]
*  And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this additional revenue [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=92.4s)]
*  with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family leave, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  child care options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=100.0s)]
*  But many economists say if tariffs are boosted, companies will pass much higher prices onto consumers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=104.2s)]
*  Walz claims Trump is only interested in creating more wealth for affluent Americans. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=110.4s)]
*  Donald Trump made a promise, and I'll give you this, he kept it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=115.4s)]
*  He took folks tomorrow, Lago, said, your riches help me give you a tax cut. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the top class. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  What happened there was an eight trillion dollar increase in the national debt, the largest ever. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  Tax cuts passed during the Trump administration are due to expire next year. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=129.6s)]
*  Trump wants to extend them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  Vice President Harris wants to extend the cuts for people making less than four hundred thousand dollars per year. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=135.8s)]
*  Iran's missile strike yesterday against Israel was cheered in Gaza. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04JSzgMZMG4&t=142.2s)]
