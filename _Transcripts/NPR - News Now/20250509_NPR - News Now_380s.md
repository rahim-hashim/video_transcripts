**NPR - News Now:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg)

*  and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has unveiled a sweeping plan to modernize U.S. air [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=5.84s)]
*  traffic control. Good morning, I'm Curova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Pope Leo XIV has celebrated the first Mass of his papacy today at the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=17.12s)]
*  The new pope is an American. The former Robert Prevost was born in Chicago. He was close to the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=30.0s)]
*  late Pope Francis and is expected to echo similar themes to Francis's, such as care for the poor [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=37.84s)]
*  and advocacy for migrants. But NPR's Jason DeRose says Pope Leo also faces criticism from earlier [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=43.92s)]
*  in his ministry. Survivors of clergy sexual abuse say Cardinal Prevost did not do enough to address [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=50.72s)]
*  the issue as a bishop or archbishop or cardinal. That's true of many in church leadership. Now the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=57.2s)]
*  question is how he'll respond to victims going forward. He's also come under criticism for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  comments on LGBTQ people. Back in 2012, he lamented what he called the culture's sympathy with, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=67.84s)]

*  George H.W. Bush in 1990 and won Republican backing. But Souter surprised many by often [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=85.76s)]
*  siding with liberal justices. Souter retired in 2009. The Trump administration has officially [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=92.48s)]
*  granted more than 50 white South Africans refugee status in the U.S. Kate Bartlett reports from [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=99.28s)]
*  Johannesburg the Afrikaners are expected to land in the U.S. next week. The group of white South [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=105.68s)]
*  Africans could arrive at Dulles Airport as early as Monday. Three sources with knowledge of the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=111.52s)]
*  matter told NPR, which has also seen an email confirming the arrangements. The sources all work [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=115.92s)]
*  for the U.S. government, so did not want to be named out of fear of retribution. This comes just [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=121.6s)]
*  three months after President Trump signed an executive order claiming Afrikaners faced [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=126.8s)]
*  persecution in South Africa and could apply for refugee status in the United States. Afrikaners [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=131.28s)]
*  are the descendants of mainly Dutch colonists. The South African government says there is no [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=137.36s)]
*  evidence they are being persecuted and has accused the U.S. administration of being taken in by [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=142.4s)]

*  Simple question, are you taking any action to facilitate his return or are you not? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=175.2s)]
*  This administration is following and complying with all federal court orders to make sure that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=179.27999999999997s)]
*  we... So you are, so because the court order that you facilitate is returned, so you are facilitating [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=184.64s)]
*  his return. Sir, Senator, thank you for the question, but what I would tell you is that we [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=189.52s)]
*  are following court orders and that your advocacy for a known terrorist is alarming to me. Madam [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  Secretary... It's alarming to me because he's a human smuggler. Madam Secretary, I'm going to have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=200.8s)]
*  to reclaim... And a terrorist and he's not a U.S. citizen. Democrats say the issue is not about [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  citizenship, it's that Abrego Garcia was denied due process as required by the Constitution. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvJNVQrfjg&t=209.04000000000002s)]
