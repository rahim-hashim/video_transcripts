# DHS Raises Its Arrest Quotas For ICE Officers To 3,000/Day | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY)
*  The Department of Homeland Security is raising its daily arrest quotas for ICE agents to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=0.0s)]
*  3,000 arrests per day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=5.2s)]
*  And there is still astonishment over Ukraine's drone attacks on Russian air bases last Sunday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=13.44s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=14.44s)]
*  Authorities in Boulder, Colorado have added four more people to the injured list from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=18.48s)]
*  the attack on peaceful marchers last weekend. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=22.2s)]
*  Colorado Public Radio's Allison Sherry reports. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=25.12s)]
*  People say in doing witness interviews with various people who saw what happened on the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=28.4s)]
*  Pearl Street Mall in Boulder on Sunday, they discovered more victims with minor injuries. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=32.16s)]
*  These were mostly people who were helping the more severely injured in the attack. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=38.08s)]
*  Two of the 12 victims remain hospitalized. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=42.48s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security says the man charged with the crime came to the U.S. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=45.36s)]
*  on a tourist visa three years ago, but didn't have legal status. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=49.68s)]
*  He was an Egyptian national but lived in Kuwait for almost 20 years. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=54.4s)]
*  He faces dozens of state charges and a federal hate crime charge so far and has another court [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=58.44s)]
*  appearance later this week. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=63.44s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Allison Sherry in Denver. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=65.62s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security is increasing its arrest quotas for immigration officers. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=69.28s)]
*  NPR's Hima Nabustio reports the demand to arrest more people comes at the same time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=74.0s)]
*  DHS is running out of space to hold detainees and money. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=79.2s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed over the weekend that Immigration and Customs [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=83.44s)]
*  Enforcement Agency is now required to conduct 3,000 arrests a day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=87.92s)]
*  That quote is an increase from 1,800. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=92.68s)]
*  But the department is also struggling to keep up with its own pace. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=95.02s)]
*  It currently has more people in detention than it has detention beds and the administration [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=98.08s)]
*  is asking Congress for billions of dollars to hire more people and increase detention [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=102.26s)]
*  space. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  But that money may not come for several more weeks. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  The targets also come amid efforts to streamline and expedite deportations, but with limited [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=109.76s)]
*  resources, including personnel, to carry out those efforts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  Hima Nabustio, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=118.4s)]
*  There's still a lot of astonishment over Ukraine's bold and unexpected drone attack on Russia [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=121.0s)]
*  last Sunday. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=126.44s)]
*  Ukraine piloted drones that hit several Russian air bases spread deep across the Russian heartland. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  Some bases were more than 2,500 miles away from Ukraine or above the Arctic Circle. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=134.4s)]
*  Ukraine calls this Operation Spider's Web. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  But NPR's Greg Myhre says some Ukrainian bloggers call it Operation Trojan Trucks. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=143.52s)]
*  Yeah, Ukraine says civilian trucks were secretly driven deep into Russia and then parked just [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=149.28s)]
*  a few miles from these Russian military bases. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=154.88s)]
*  The attacks were then launched remotely, allowing the hidden drones to fly out of the trucks [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=158.0s)]
*  and strike some of Russia's most valuable heavy bombers that were just parked out in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=163.0s)]
*  the open at the bases. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=167.84s)]
*  NPR's Greg Myhre prepared that report. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=169.28s)]
*  This morning, Ukraine is claiming that it has hit a strategic bridge in the occupied [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=172.88s)]
*  region of Crimea. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=177.28s)]
*  Ukraine says it used underwater explosives to rupture the Kerch Strait Bridge. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=179.04s)]
*  Russia uses this bridge to ship military supplies to its troops fighting Ukraine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  This is the third time Ukraine says it has hit that bridge. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=188.52s)]
*  Health officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross say that 27 Palestinians [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=192.84s)]
*  have been killed today in Gaza and dozens injured by the Israeli military. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=197.6s)]
*  The Palestinians were trying to get food delivered by a private U.S.-backed contractor in Gaza. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=202.32s)]
*  NPR's Hadil Al-Shalchi reports that disorder has continued around delivery of the food, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=208.52s)]
*  as aid organizations warn Gaza is close to famine. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=214.12s)]
*  It was another day of chaos and confusion as thousands of Palestinians tried to receive [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=217.94s)]
*  food from a site delivering supplies in the south of Gaza. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=222.48s)]
*  Witnesses who were approaching the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, site said the Israeli [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=226.28s)]
*  military shot into the crowd. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=231.12s)]
*  The Israeli military said that it initially fired warning shots to disperse a crowd that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=233.44s)]
*  had gotten too close to troops and then directed fire near individuals who continued to approach [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=237.44s)]
*  them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=242.8s)]
*  The military said it was aware of casualties and was investigating. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=243.8s)]
*  GHF insisted there was no shooting in its facility and said the incident took place [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=247.12s)]
*  beyond their quote, secure distribution site. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=251.76s)]
*  The United Nations said that aid distribution has become a quote, death trap. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=254.64s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shalchi, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=259.0s)]
*  Education Secretary Linda McMahon is expected to testify before a Senate panel today. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=262.24s)]
*  She'll be asked about her agency's budget and President Trump's plans to close the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  Education Department. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=271.92s)]
*  The Trump administration wants to lift Biden-era protections against oil and grass, rather [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=273.96s)]
*  gas drilling, on millions of acres of public land in Alaska. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=279.0s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brady reports the mostly undisturbed area is considered important habitat for wildlife. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=283.0s)]
*  At issue is about 13 million acres of land in the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=289.44s)]
*  While it's labeled a petroleum reserve, it's mostly undeveloped wild land. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=294.2s)]
*  The debate over whether to allow oil companies to drill there has simmered for years. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=299.26s)]
*  The American Petroleum Institute applauded the proposal to lift the year-old protections, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=303.92s)]
*  saying the oil industry is important to Alaska's economy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  Environmental groups opposed the move, saying wild places deserve protection from drilling [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=312.12s)]
*  rigs. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=317.12s)]
*  Pollution from burning oil and gas are significant contributors to climate change. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=318.12s)]
*  The Bureau of Land Management will collect comments for 60 days before issuing a final [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=322.44s)]
*  rule. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=327.0s)]
*  Jeff Brady reporting. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=328.0s)]
*  A new insurance report shows that hurricanes have caused hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=329.28s)]
*  in damage in the U.S. over the last decade. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=334.04s)]
*  As NPR's Rebecca Herscher reports, about half of those losses were insured. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=337.6s)]
*  Of the five most expensive hurricanes to ever hit the U.S., three of them have happened [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=342.4s)]
*  in the last eight years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=347.12s)]
*  That's according to an analysis by the re-insurance company Munich Re. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=349.12s)]
*  Property insurance companies were on the hook for about half the bill from those storms, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=354.04s)]
*  the analysis estimates. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=358.12s)]
*  Insurance companies rely on their own insurance to cover such losses in the form of what's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=360.6s)]
*  called re-insurance. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  Home insurance prices and the price of re-insurance for companies have both skyrocketed in recent [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=367.64s)]
*  years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=372.72s)]
*  This is the first week of Atlantic hurricane season. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=373.8s)]
*  It runs through the end of November. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZyuQlXaRTY&t=376.46s)]
