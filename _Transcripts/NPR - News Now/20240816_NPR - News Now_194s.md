*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=12.76s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=13.76s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump has been facing pressure from Republicans to focus on policy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=17.84s)]
*  issues and not on crowd sizes and personalities. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=21.76s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordoña reports Trump's events this week, including a press conference yesterday [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=24.76s)]

*  broke the world, frankly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=52.42s)]
*  But he also veered away from policy, admitted he was angry, and said he felt he was entitled [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  to making personal attacks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=58.82s)]

*  He's weird. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=66.5s)]

*  Prices are supposed to start tomorrow that affect how real estate agents get paid by [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=88.2s)]
*  people buying and selling homes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=92.28s)]
*  This comes after the National Association of Realtors settled several lawsuits this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=94.96000000000001s)]

*  real estate professional, from their agent, their broker, their realtor. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=115.38s)]
*  And then also, we're having a conversation with the consumer upfront about how we expect [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=118.62s)]
*  to get paid. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=123.94s)]

*  The websites allow users to upload pictures of people and create new images of those people [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  naked using open source AI models. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=154.3s)]
*  This is a big multifaceted problem that as a society we need to solve as soon as possible. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=157.02s)]

*  may arise to replace the ones that shut down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx4X4JV1bo&t=183.06s)]
