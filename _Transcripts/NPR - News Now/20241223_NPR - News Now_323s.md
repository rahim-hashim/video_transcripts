*  President-elect Trump argued that the U.S. should control the Panama Canal and Greenland. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=8.08s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=13.68s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  The White House says President Biden has commuted the death sentences of 37 men on federal death row. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  And Piers-Dipa Shivaram says Biden changed the ease-to-life in prison terms without the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=24.0s)]
*  possibility of parole. He says his decision to commute the sentences for the 37 men was guided [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=28.64s)]
*  by his conscience, his experience as a public defender, his time as a senator, vice president, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=34.72s)]
*  and president. And Biden said, quote, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=39.92s)]
*  the death penalty at the federal level. And Piers-Dipa Shivaram reporting. But Biden did [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=45.44s)]

*  church near Charleston, South Carolina, and Jokar Tsarnaev, who bombed the Boston Marathon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=60.48s)]
*  President-elect Trump was in Phoenix yesterday where he spoke at the closing of a conservative [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=66.24s)]
*  political conference. For Member Station KJZZ, Cameron Sanchez has more. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=71.44s)]
*  The convention is called America Fest and is put on annually by a conservative nonprofit called [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=76.88s)]
*  Turning Point. One of the attendees is college student James Hart, who says that Trump gives [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=81.36s)]
*  his generation a voice. You know, Trump isn't super young, but he has that young energy, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  that young males need, you know, somebody they can look up to and say, I want to be like that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=90.0s)]
*  I want to be, you know, successful. I want to have a family and I want to build a house and stuff like [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=93.84s)]
*  that. A crowd of thousands was hyped up by an emboldened slate of speakers, including Trump [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=98.56s)]
*  himself. He touted his cabinet picks, thanked his supporters and doubled down on promises he's made [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=102.88s)]
*  on the campaign trail. For NPR News, I'm Cameron Sanchez. During his remarks, Trump also demanded [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=107.6s)]
*  that the U.S. regain control of the Panama Canal. Panama's president says that's a non-starter. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=112.64s)]
*  Trump also wrote online the U.S. needs to own and control Greenland. That is a district of Denmark [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  that partially governs itself. During his first term in the White House, Trump said he wanted to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=124.24s)]

*  which is partially owned by Nissan, may also join the deal. Nissan has been struggling [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=154.64s)]
*  financially, and if Honda doesn't bail it out, analysts see it as a choice target for a foreign [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=159.2s)]
*  takeover. Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said at a press conference that they need to pool resources to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  stay competitive in the world's largest car market, China, where local firms are squeezing out foreign [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=170.0s)]
*  carmakers. Mibe said the merger could still fall through, or as he put it, the possibility of this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  not being implemented is not zero. Anthony Kuhn in PR News Seoul. The new interim Syrian leader [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=181.2s)]
*  is trying to assert control over the rebel factions that helped topple the Assad regime, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=188.79999999999998s)]

*  government will soon announce the new structure of the defense ministry, wearing a suit and tie [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  instead of fatigues. Al-Sharif spoke alongside the Turkish foreign minister, the first to visit [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=204.64s)]

*  begin to dissolve and that all weapons should come under state control, including those held by Kurdish-led [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=214.56s)]

*  plan. Health reporter Sarah Bowden spoke to officials at NIH. Well, the agency agrees that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=267.76s)]
*  there's a real urgency to find treatments, but they told me that scientists need a solid understanding [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  of the underlying biology of long COVID, which is a complicated disease that can damage nearly [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=278.72s)]
*  every organ system. And researchers have learned a lot. For example, one NIH-funded study found that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZP4mP7vmZ8&t=284.32s)]
