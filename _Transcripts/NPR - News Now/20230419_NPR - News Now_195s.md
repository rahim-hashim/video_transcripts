# Americans' Access To Abortion Pill Hinges On Supreme Court Action Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E)
*  The Air National Guardsman accused of leaking classified documents online returns to federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=0.0s)]
*  court today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=5.48s)]
*  And Fox News will pay nearly $800 million to settle a blockbuster defamation lawsuit. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=6.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=12.72s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=13.72s)]
*  The Massachusetts Air National Guardsman accused of leaking classified government documents [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=17.8s)]
*  returns to federal court in Boston this morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  For Member Station WBUR, Ali Jarmanting reports the hearing will determine whether Jack Tashara [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=25.2s)]
*  remains in custody. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=30.68s)]
*  Investigators say 21-year-old Tashara took home top secret documents and shared photos [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=32.64s)]
*  of them in a private group chat. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  From there, the classified information spread to more public social media sites. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=40.0s)]
*  That prompted one of the biggest intelligence leak investigations in recent years. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=44.84s)]
*  Tashara has been held since he was arrested at his Massachusetts home last week. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=49.92s)]
*  If found guilty, he faces up to 15 years in prison. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=54.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Air Force is investigating the intelligence unit where he worked. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=58.28s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Ali Jarmanting in Boston. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  Today's the last day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=66.48s)]
*  People in all parts of the U.S. can access a common abortion pill unless the U.S. Supreme [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=67.48s)]
*  Court intervenes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=72.16s)]
*  The Biden administration has asked the court to continue pausing lower court rulings that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  block access to Mifapristone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=78.44s)]
*  Supposed to abortion, want the high court to overturn the FDA's approval of the medication. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=81.0s)]
*  It's used in most abortions in the U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=86.64s)]
*  Fox News will pay Dominion voting systems nearly $800 million to settle a defamation [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=89.84s)]
*  lawsuit. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=95.44s)]
*  Fox aired lies about Dominion, repeatedly saying the company helped switch votes away [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=96.44s)]
*  from then-President Trump in the 2020 election. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=101.32s)]
*  NPR's David Falkenflick says Fox has released a short statement. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=104.28s)]
*  It says that Fox acknowledges the court's ruling that certain statements about Dominion [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=108.68s)]
*  voting systems were false. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=115.12s)]
*  And that's technically true. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=116.76s)]
*  What it doesn't say is that Fox itself broadcast and at times embraced those claims. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=118.0s)]
*  And there's no apology on the air. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  But that said, it did acknowledge the falsity of it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=124.84s)]
*  And the lawyers that I talked to from Dominion last night pointed to that and say, look, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  that's really important. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=132.88s)]
*  That's part of the record. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=133.88s)]
*  And the court has found that and Fox has acknowledged that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=134.88s)]
*  NPR's David Falkenflick reporting. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=137.28s)]
*  A ceasefire fell apart yesterday in Sudan. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=139.76s)]
*  Fighting has never stopped between the combatants. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=143.24s)]
*  Michael Koloki reports today is a fifth straight day of chaos and violence. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=146.08s)]
*  There were reports of gunfire and explosions in various cities overnight as clashes continued [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=151.2s)]
*  between the Sudanese armed forces and the paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=156.0s)]
*  Both sides have accused each other of violating a 24-hour ceasefire that was due to have commenced [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=161.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, in a statement, a local doctors union said several hospitals across the country [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=167.6s)]
*  were facing a shortage of both medicines and medical personnel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  While noting that some hospitals had been closed and their patients evacuated following [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=176.92s)]
*  bombardment of their premises, leaders from across the region have continued to call on [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  both sides to end the fighting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=186.16s)]
*  For NPR News, I am Michael Koloki in Nairobi. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvCsjl0Lo-E&t=191.67999999999998s)]
