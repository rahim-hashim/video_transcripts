*  The same storm is responsible for blizzard conditions farther north. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=113.03999999999999s)]

*  Policymakers for the Federal Reserve conclude their two-day meeting in Washington today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=122.24s)]
*  They're widely expected to increase short-term interest rates by one-half of one percent. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=127.11999999999999s)]

*  The government says long COVID is responsible for more than 3,000 deaths in the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Rob Stein reports. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=150.4s)]
*  The National Center for Health Statistics scoured death certificates for any mention of long COVID [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=152.16s)]
*  and found more than 3,500 deaths that doctors specifically blamed on the condition. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  That includes deaths from heart attacks and strokes that doctors said were caused by chronic complications of COVID-19. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=163.68s)]
*  However, the researchers and others say the estimate is likely a significant undercount of the true number of deaths from long COVID, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=170.96s)]
*  which is still poorly understood and defined. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=179.28s)]
*  And deaths from long COVID are likely to continue to rise as more people continue to get COVID. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=182.48s)]
*  NPR's Rob Stein reporting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y8HxGuN7yM&t=188.56s)]
