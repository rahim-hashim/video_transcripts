# Kroger, Albertsons' Merger Blocked By 2 Courts | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc)
*  A merger between the Kroger and Albertson's grocery store chains has been blocked by two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=0.0s)]
*  courts temporarily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=4.9s)]
*  And South Korea's former defense minister has attempted suicide while he's being held [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  in detention. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=10.84s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=11.84s)]
*  I'm Krova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=12.84s)]
*  The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has been denied bail in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=16.6s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=20.84s)]
*  Suspect Luigi Mangione was taken to the courthouse yesterday near Altoona. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=21.84s)]
*  As he walked inside, he yelled to reporters something not clear, then said, quote, an [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=26.22s)]
*  insult to the American people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=31.58s)]
*  Mangione's lawyer says he'll try to block his client's extradition to New York to face [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  murder and other charges there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=37.98s)]
*  Both a federal court and a state court in Washington have temporarily blocked the super [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=40.46s)]
*  merger between grocery store corporations Albertson's and Kroger. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=44.84s)]
*  And Pierzalina Seljuks says government lawyers argued consumers would suffer from a merger [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=49.22s)]
*  because the companies compete head to head. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=53.94s)]
*  They keep tabs on each other's prices, store hours, quality of products, and that putting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=56.86s)]
*  two rivals under one roof would leave shoppers worse off. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=62.16s)]
*  Fewer choices, higher prices. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=65.8s)]
*  Now Kroger and Albertson's made the case that the merger for them was a matter of survival, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=67.72s)]
*  that their biggest rivals are not conventional supermarkets like each other, but giants like [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=72.1s)]
*  Walmart, Costco, Amazon. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=76.66s)]
*  And Pierzalina Seljuks reporting. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=78.9s)]
*  It's been four days since Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fled his country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=81.34s)]

*  And Pierzalina Seljuks reports from the Syrian capital, Damascus. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=90.34s)]
*  So far the handover of power in Syria is much less chaotic than happened in Libya or Iraq [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=94.28s)]
*  after the dictators there fell. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjj1LZhQbc&t=100.14s)]
