# Israelis Mark 1 Year Since Hamas' Oct. 7 Attacks | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc)
*  Two Americans have been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery in gene regulation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=0.0s)]
*  And Israelis are marking one year since Hamas killed around 1,200 people in the invasion. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=12.5s)]
*  This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded today to two American scientists. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=17.0s)]
*  It's for discovering an important way that genes are regulated. NPR's Rob Stein explains. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=22.5s)]
*  The Nobel Assembly awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Victor Ambrose at the University of Massachusetts Medical School [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=28.0s)]
*  and Gary Ruvkin at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=37.5s)]
*  The pair won the prize for their work discovering what's known as microRNA. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=42.0s)]
*  By studying a tiny worm known as the C. elegans, the pair showed that microRNA is necessary for translating genes into proteins. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=47.5s)]
*  The Nobel Assembly says their work has been important in the study of many aspects of basic biology, including the development of cancers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=57.5s)]
*  Rob Stein, NPR News. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=66.5s)]
*  It's been one year since Hamas led attacks on Israel. Sirens wailed across Israel today as rockets were launched from Gaza. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=69.0s)]
*  Israeli authorities say the October 7 attacks last year killed around 1,200 people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=76.5s)]
*  Health officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks have killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. NPR's Hadil Al-Shilchi reports. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=82.0s)]
*  Hamas claimed responsibility for firing the rockets from Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=90.5s)]
*  Israeli police say two people were injured in the Stokdan area near the Ben Gurion airport, but the injuries were not critical. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=94.5s)]
*  Police are also investigating the site of an explosion in Holon, a suburb of Tel Aviv. They said there were no casualties there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=102.0s)]
*  Images on Israeli television showed large, billowing gray smoke rising from the area. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=109.0s)]
*  The Israeli military said the rockets today were launched from Gaza at almost the same time as they were on this day last year. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=114.0s)]
*  The military says it responded with airstrikes and is sending more troops to Gaza to thwart a possibility of Hamas repeating its attacks to mark the year. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=120.5s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shilchi, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=129.5s)]
*  Hurricane Milton is gaining strength in the Gulf of Mexico with top-sustained winds of 100 miles per hour. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=132.5s)]
*  It could make landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast by Wednesday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=139.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the death toll from Hurricane Helene has reached at least 227 people. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=142.0s)]
*  As the southeastern states try to recover from Hurricane Helene's damage, both presidential candidates could face political consequences. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=147.0s)]
*  And Biersmaar Eliason has more. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=156.0s)]
*  Helene hit hardest in two important swing states, North Carolina and Georgia. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=158.0s)]
*  And the hurricane has already become a political issue there, with Donald Trump falsely accusing the Biden-Harris administration of withholding aid to Republican areas damaged by the storm. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=163.5s)]
*  Local Republican officials have debunked that claim. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=173.5s)]
*  There's also concern about whether the hurricane could depress turnout if voters are more interested in cleaning out their homes than returning an absentee ballot or looking for a polling station. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=176.5s)]
*  Mara Eliason, NPR News. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=186.5s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpTC8Ng4zc&t=189.5s)]
