# California Closes The Loophole In Its Ban On Plastic Bags | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw)
*  The suspect in an apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump is due [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=0.0s)]
*  in federal court today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=5.0s)]
*  And the search continues for suspects in Saturday's deadly mass shooting in Birmingham, Alabama. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=6.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=12.88s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=13.88s)]
*  Israel has been heavily bombarding the south of Lebanon while calling for civilians to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=17.96s)]
*  leave. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=22.0s)]
*  The attacks between Israel and the militant Lebanese group Hezbollah are among the heaviest [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=23.0s)]
*  since the Gaza war began last October. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=27.66s)]
*  NPR's Jane Arraff has more from Beirut. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=30.66s)]
*  Lebanon's state news agency said the latest Israeli strikes for the first time reached [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=33.3s)]
*  80 miles north of the border into central Lebanon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=37.5s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah have launched hundreds of attacks across the border since a wave [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=42.38s)]
*  of Israeli strikes in Lebanon last week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  They included exploding pagers and walkie talkies and the killing of a senior Hezbollah [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=49.58s)]
*  commander in an airstrike in Beirut Friday. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=54.62s)]

*  50 people, including women and children, as more bodies were recovered from the rubble. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=61.78s)]
*  Lebanon's information minister Ziad Makary told Reuters his ministry had received a recorded [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=68.02s)]
*  call to evacuate the building in Beirut. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=73.34s)]
*  He dismissed it as psychological warfare. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=76.96s)]
*  Jane Arraff, NPR News, Beirut. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=80.1s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have struck an agreement [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=82.58s)]
*  on a short-term spending bill. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=86.86s)]
*  It will keep the federal government funded through December 20th after the general election [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=88.94s)]
*  is over. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=93.34s)]
*  The bill drops a controversial provision that says undocumented migrants in the U.S. cannot [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=94.46s)]
*  vote. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=99.78s)]
*  That is already illegal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=100.9s)]
*  The man who's been arrested in connection with an apparent assassination attempt on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=103.08s)]
*  former President Donald Trump will be in federal court today in Florida. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=107.3s)]
*  NPR's Greg Allen reports the suspect is being held now on federal weapons charges. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=111.74s)]
*  Although he's in court for a detention hearing in which he could ask for bail, Ryan Ruth [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=117.02s)]
*  is not expected to be released anytime soon. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=120.62s)]
*  Prosecutors have already indicated they believe he's a flight risk and that he could be a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=123.38s)]
*  danger to the community. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=126.78s)]
*  For now, Ruth is being held on charges of illegal possession of a firearm as a convicted [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=128.46s)]
*  felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  While there's no federal statute for attempted murder, there are a host of other crimes Ruth [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=136.58s)]
*  could potentially be charged with. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  They include threats to kill a former president and assault on a federal law enforcement officer. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  Stacked with weapons charges, Ruth could be looking at a prison sentence of 60 years or [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=146.94s)]
*  more. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  More charges and an indictment are expected later this week. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  Greg Allen, NPR News, West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=155.42s)]
*  Authorities in Birmingham, Alabama say they still don't have anyone in custody in connection [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  with Saturday night's deadly mass shooting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=163.66s)]
*  The shooting was an open fire on a crowd at a popular Birmingham night spot. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=167.14s)]
*  Four people were killed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=170.94s)]
*  Another 17 people were injured. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=172.5s)]
*  Gabriel Eslami was one of them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=174.5s)]
*  Almost 100 people in line. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=176.5s)]
*  And not even five minutes into being in line, you just hear gunshots, gunshots. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=179.66s)]
*  Police say they believe the guns used in the shooting were modified to work as automatic [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=186.1s)]
*  weapons. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law on plastic bags. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=191.94s)]
*  Plastic bags intended to close a loophole in the state's ban on them at supermarkets [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=196.26s)]
*  and other retail stores. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  Steve Futterman reports from Los Angeles. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=202.06s)]
*  California has had a ban on single-use plastic bags at grocery and retail stores for a decade. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=204.66s)]
*  In 2014, the state was the first in the country to pass such legislation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=211.06s)]
*  But there was a loophole. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=216.0s)]
*  Stores were allowed to sell thicker, reusable plastic bags for 10 cents. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=217.73999999999998s)]
*  However, not enough people reused, resulting in more plastic waste than ever before. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  The new law bans all plastic bags. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  And paper bags, which are still allowed, must be made with at least 50% recycled material. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  Manufacturers of plastic bags oppose the new law, claiming it will result in the use of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=237.34s)]
*  what they call non-recyclable plastic cloth bags. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=242.26s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=246.9s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNwcZCazKw&t=251.94s)]
