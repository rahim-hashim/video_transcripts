*  Israeli soldiers continue to search Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Biden and Chinese President Xi agreed in talks yesterday [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=3.68s)]
*  to reestablish communication between their militaries. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=7.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=10.24s)]
*  Gaza's health ministry says Israeli soldiers are searching the underground levels of the Strip's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=14.56s)]
*  biggest hospital today. It says they've detained some of the technicians who work there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=19.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel's military has been releasing videos of what it says is evidence that Hamas [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=23.92s)]
*  has been housing its fighters in the hospital. NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=28.72s)]
*  In video footage overlaid with music, Israeli Army spokesperson Jonathan Konrickis points to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  what he says was found inside Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=39.519999999999996s)]

*  under the hospital. And they say that even if Hamas did have fighters there, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=59.04s)]
*  it doesn't mean Israel can endanger civilians. Al-Shifa hospital ran out of fuel last weekend, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=63.04s)]
*  but hundreds of patients, doctors and evacuees remain inside. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=68.72s)]

*  group of business leaders, Xi said China and the U.S. need to cooperate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  We, the largest developing country, that is China, and the largest developed country, the United States, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=94.72s)]
*  we must get along with each other. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=105.60000000000001s)]

*  Texas Public Radio's Gage Davila prepared this report. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=138.88s)]
*  SpaceX plans to launch Starship this Friday from the same location as April's launch attempt, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=142.79999999999998s)]

*  intended to prevent Starship's launch pad from disintegrating as it did during the rocket's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=168.32s)]
*  launch in April. Fish and Wildlife says the new water deluge system will have virtually no effect [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAKUVLy6SeY&t=172.56s)]
