**NPR - News Now:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU)
*  Vice President Harris will deliver a eulogy today for Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=0.0s)]
*  who died last month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=5.44s)]
*  And California's Park Fire has burned more than 600 square miles. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=7.04s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=11.44s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is being castigated for falsely claiming that Vice President Harris [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  didn't identify as a black person until recently. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=21.2s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=24.48s)]
*  Harris has black and Indian ancestry and has long identified as a black woman. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=25.6s)]
*  Trump made the false claim at the National Association of Black Journalist Convention [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=30.48s)]
*  yesterday where he had testy exchanges with questioners. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=34.72s)]
*  Trump's running mate, JD Vance, defended him at a campaign event last night in suburban Phoenix. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=38.32s)]
*  Unlike Kamala Harris, President Trump showed up and took some tough questions. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  Harris is in Texas this week for campaigning and to attend a funeral. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=49.36s)]
*  NPR has learned that Harris had offered to appear virtually at the convention, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=53.2s)]
*  but the Black Journalists Association turned her down. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=57.36s)]
*  The association says now that it is in talks with Harris [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=60.720000000000006s)]
*  to schedule a question and answer session in September. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=63.760000000000005s)]

*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, Harris has described the congresswoman as a dear friend. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=74.0s)]
*  There's an important role presidents play in times of national trauma and personal grief. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=79.2s)]
*  The Consular-in-Chief. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  With her eulogy for Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=85.92s)]
*  Harris will give the American people a preview of how she would approach that part of the job, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=88.88s)]
*  should she win in November, says former Obama speechwriter Terry Zuplatt. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=93.92s)]
*  In an election, and this is true for Vice President Harris, but it's true for any candidate, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=98.56s)]
*  in an election every speech is in essence an audition. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Zuplatt says you can learn as much about the person delivering the eulogy, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=107.44s)]
*  their values and capacity for empathy, as about the person they are honoring. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=116.16s)]
*  In Northern California, the Park Fire north of Sacramento has burned more than 600 square miles. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=118.0s)]
*  It's the largest wildfire actively burning in the United States. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=124.56s)]
*  From member station KQED, Keith Mizoguchi reports [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=128.4s)]

*  Single-family homes make up a significant portion of the buildings destroyed so far by the Park Fire. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=136.08s)]
*  As of Wednesday, fire officials say inspection teams have finished about 75% [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  of their damage assessment work. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=147.28s)]
*  Crews have been able to slowly increase containment on the massive fire, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  but there are concerns about upcoming weather conditions. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=152.4s)]
*  Hot, dry and windy conditions are expected this weekend, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=156.0s)]
*  with thunderstorms also likely. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=159.52s)]
*  That could lead to erratic fire behavior. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Keith Mizoguchi in San Francisco. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=164.56s)]

*  Thousands of people filled streets in Iran to mourn Haniyeh. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrK7w7VcIyU&t=183.51999999999998s)]
