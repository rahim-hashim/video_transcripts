# Barack And Michelle Obama Address The DNC | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI)
*  Barack and Michelle Obama addressed the Democratic National Convention last night in Chicago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=0.0s)]
*  and Secretary of State Antony Blinken has wrapped up his latest visit to the Middle [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=5.28s)]
*  East. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=8.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=9.92s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=10.92s)]
*  Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle rallied Democrats in support of Vice [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=14.24s)]
*  President Harris on the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=18.28s)]
*  NPR's Ben Giles reports the Obamas also criticized Harris' GOP rival, former President Donald [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=23.28s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=28.88s)]
*  Trumpal's addresses to the DNC were a marked departure from the 2016 convention, when Michelle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=29.959999999999997s)]
*  Obama famously said, when they go low, we go high. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=35.56s)]
*  The former president's speech included a dig at what he called Trump's obsession with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=39.56s)]
*  crowd sizes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=44.04s)]
*  And the former first lady criticized what she called Trump's narrow worldview, rocked [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=45.64s)]
*  by the existence of two hardworking, successful black people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Who's going to tell him that the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=53.96s)]
*  black jobs? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=57.8s)]
*  The Obamas also told Democrats not to underestimate the fight ahead, a path filled with what Michelle [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=59.72s)]
*  Obama called the ugly, misogynistic, racist lies of the Trump campaign. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=65.64s)]
*  Ben Giles, NPR News, Chicago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump campaigned in Michigan yesterday to talk about fighting crime. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Crime in America is out of control. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to make it along with the economy, inflation, strong borders, and energy dominance, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=78.96s)]
*  my top priority. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=85.72s)]
*  Including crime in America. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=86.92s)]
*  You know, normally that's done locally, and we're going to give the local people a lot [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=88.6s)]
*  of help. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=95.48s)]
*  But Trump's claim is misleading. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=96.48s)]
*  A survey from the Major Cities Chiefs Association shows that in nearly 70 major cities, violent [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=98.28s)]
*  crimes have dropped for the first six months of this year, compared to the same time last [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=104.12s)]
*  year. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=109.24s)]
*  That includes a 17 percent drop in homicides. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=110.24s)]
*  The survey also showed fewer other violent crimes were committed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=113.48s)]
*  Three states held primary elections yesterday, Alaska, Florida, and Wyoming. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=117.8s)]
*  In Florida, conservative Congressman Matt Gaetz also won the GOP nomination. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  He faced opponents backed by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=126.58s)]
*  He's fiercely criticized Gaetz for forcing McCarthy out of the House Speaker's chair. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=129.92s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken has concluded his ninth recent visit to the Middle East. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=135.16s)]
*  He's seeking a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=140.4s)]
*  And Piers Carey Kahn reports Blinken says countries in the region want a deal too. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  As he was leaving Doha, Blinken told reporters that he was still holding out hope for a peace [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=146.96s)]
*  deal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=151.84s)]
*  He said the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt are committed to finding a solution with, quote, a fierce [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=152.84s)]
*  urgency of now. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=157.96s)]
*  This needs to get done, and it needs to get done in the days ahead, and we will do everything [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=158.96s)]
*  possible to get it across the finish line. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=163.6s)]
*  In his latest visit, Blinken tried to push both sides toward a deal, yet both Israel [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=166.38s)]
*  and Hamas blame each other for blocking proposals. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=170.46s)]
*  Talks are set to resume again Thursday in Cairo, according to Egypt's foreign minister. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  Details of the proposal on the table have not been made public, but negotiators say [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=178.46s)]
*  they have an outline to bridge the gaps between demands from both Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=182.98s)]
*  NPR's Carey Kahn, this is NPR. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psRCq5NhjhI&t=187.66s)]
