# Biden Administration Proposes New Restrictions On Asylum-Seekers | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es)
*  President Biden will wrap up his time in Europe today with one more meeting about the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Biden administration is proposing tougher restrictions on asylum seekers at the southern U.S. border. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=11.4s)]
*  President Biden is spending his last day in Poland focused on the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=16.2s)]
*  He'll talk with NATO officials and meet the leaders of the Bucharest Nine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=20.6s)]
*  The BBC's Sarah Smith reports the group focuses on regional defense and aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=24.6s)]
*  The leaders of nine Eastern European countries with direct experience of living under authoritarian communist rule [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=30.0s)]
*  will be eager to learn from President Biden that America is committed to defending their security over the long term. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=36.5s)]
*  They will have been reassured to hear him say in his Warsaw speech last night that the war in Ukraine is a fight for freedom and democracy, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=42.7s)]
*  a battle that Russia cannot be allowed to win. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=49.7s)]
*  The BBC's Sarah Smith reporting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=52.2s)]
*  There's a severe winter storm hitting the northern plains. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=54.6s)]
*  Some schools in the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin are closed today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=57.6s)]
*  The National Weather Service says parts of Minnesota could get two feet of snow. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=61.6s)]
*  Forecasters are telling people to stay home if they can. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=65.9s)]
*  The Biden administration is proposing tougher restrictions on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=69.5s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports the proposal is likely to be challenged in court. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=75.0s)]
*  The proposed rule would make it harder for migrants to get asylum if they cross the border illegally [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=79.39999999999999s)]
*  after passing through Mexico or another country without seeking protection there first. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=83.3s)]
*  Critics accuse the Biden administration of betraying its promise to restore asylum protections at the border. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=88.0s)]
*  They say the proposal closely mirrors a Trump administration policy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=93.3s)]
*  that would have blocked nearly all migrants from seeking asylum at the border. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=96.5s)]
*  But the Biden administration disputes that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=100.1s)]
*  Officials argue this rule is different from Trump's version because it's not intended to cut off asylum completely [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=102.1s)]
*  and includes exceptions for vulnerable migrants. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=107.4s)]
*  Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=110.0s)]
*  In Wisconsin, one liberal and one conservative candidate have each made it through a state Supreme Court primary election. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=111.9s)]
*  They'll face off in the general election in April. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  The outcome could affect the state's current ban on almost all abortions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=121.4s)]
*  From member station WUWM, Chuck Quirmbach has more. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=125.5s)]
*  Milwaukee County Judge Janet Protasewicz, a liberal who says she supports abortion rights, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=129.5s)]
*  came in first in Tuesday's contest. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=135.8s)]
*  She told supporters she plans no time off before the general election. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=138.3s)]
*  And the reason we're not even taking a day off is because everything we care about is going to be determined by who wins this election. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=144.3s)]
*  Protasewicz's opponent will be former state justice Daniel Kelly. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=153.8s)]
*  He's been endorsed by anti-abortion rights groups that are fighting a lawsuit seeking to overturn Wisconsin's abortion ban [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=158.0s)]
*  that took effect last summer. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=165.7s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Chuck Quirmbach in Milwaukee. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro says he has made a criminal referral of railroad Norfolk Southern [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  over the toxic train derailment that happened earlier this month. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=177.6s)]
*  This occurred in nearby Ohio. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  Shapiro says the railroad provided inaccurate information and modeling data about the accident. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7YF9ni62Es&t=183.79999999999998s)]
