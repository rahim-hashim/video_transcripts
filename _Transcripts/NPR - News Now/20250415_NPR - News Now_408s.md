# Trump Again Floats Deporting U.S. Criminals To El Salvador | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y)
*  President Trump is again floating the idea of deporting Americans to El Salvador. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Trump administration is freezing billions in funding for Harvard University [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=4.64s)]
*  after the university rejected demands around its hiring and admissions practices. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=13.92s)]
*  President Trump met Salvadoran President Naib Bukele at the White House yesterday. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Trump did not ask Bukele to release a man wrongly deported from the U.S. last month to a Salvadoran [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=22.32s)]
*  prison. The White House claims without evidence the deported man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, is a gang [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=28.0s)]
*  member. Allegations his lawyers deny. The U.S. Supreme Court has told the Trump administration to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=33.44s)]
*  facilitate his return. And Piers Franco Ortonia says it appears the Trump administration is taking [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  a very limited view of the court's decision. So at this meeting yesterday, Attorney General [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=45.04s)]
*  Pam Bondi said the Supreme Court's order to facilitate simply means they need to provide [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  a plane to return them. But first, El Salvador has to release them. And it's clear the Trump [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=56.16s)]
*  administration has no intention of asking Bukele to do that. And Piers Franco Ortonia is reporting. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Trump also talked to the Salvadoran president yesterday about the possibility of deporting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=70.16s)]
*  American citizens to El Salvador. Trump says U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is reviewing this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=74.64s)]
*  If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem. Now, we're studying the laws right now. Pam is [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=80.64s)]
*  studying. If we can do that, that's good. And I'm talking about violent people. I'm talking about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=88.72s)]
*  really bad people. The Salvadoran president said that he had, quote, room. Another pro-Palestinian [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  protester has been detained by federal immigration officials. Mossad Madawi was an organizer at [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=99.52s)]
*  Columbia University's protests last year. And Piers Jasmine Garz reports he was detained yesterday [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=105.84s)]
*  at an immigration office in Vermont after arriving for a citizenship test. Mossad Madawi was born and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=112.4s)]
*  raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the U.S. in 2014. He'd recently gotten [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=119.04s)]
*  his B.A. and was planning to enroll at Columbia for a master's degree in international affairs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  He has a green card. His lawyers say he believed he was arriving to an immigration appointment [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=130.56s)]
*  that would bring him closer to becoming a U.S. citizen. He is detained at an immigration center [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=135.44s)]
*  in Colchester, Vermont. A judge has granted his lawyers' requests for a temporary restraining order [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=140.96s)]
*  to prevent federal officials from transferring him to a more conservative jurisdiction, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=146.8s)]
*  which is what has happened to several other college demonstrators who've been arrested. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=152.0s)]
*  Jasmine Garz, NPR News, New York. The Trump administration has pulled more than two billion [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=156.8s)]
*  dollars of federal funding from Harvard University. The university has refused to comply with several [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=162.8s)]
*  Trump administration demands. Some of these demands include getting rid of all DEI programs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  and tracking students who quote support terrorism or anti-Semitism. Harvard says no government, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  no matter which party is in power, should dictate what private universities can teach or whom they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  can admit or hire. NPR's Nike Metha reports Harvard says it will lose funding for programs that benefit [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  all Americans. Harvard actually updated the home page of its website to reflect how federal dollars [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=192.48s)]
*  support research they do. They list research on treatments for several forms of cancer, heart disease, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  organs and transplantation, and they say federal funding is the university's largest source of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=204.0s)]
*  support for what Harvard calls cutting-edge groundbreaking research. And Piers' Nike Metha [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  reporting. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is denying a request from Washington State. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=213.44s)]
*  Washington officials are seeking help to recover from a storm last year. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=219.44s)]
*  From member station KUOW, Scott Greenstone has more. In the Seattle area last year, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=223.52s)]
*  winds from a bomb cyclone felled trees onto homes and power lines. The damage topped 30 million, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=228.96s)]
*  but last week FEMA said they wouldn't help, giving no reason why and not responding to a request for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=235.44s)]
*  comment. Governor Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said Washington met all criteria. You would like to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=240.8s)]
*  think that our federal government would not be making decisions about emergency assistance based [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=246.96s)]
*  on how a state leans politically or how a state voted in the last presidential election, but you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=252.88s)]
*  know we have to acknowledge that that is certainly a possibility here. In President Trump's last term, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=258.24s)]
*  a Washington state application for wildfire relief remained unanswered for four months [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=263.68s)]
*  until Biden took office. For NPR News, I'm Scott Greenstone in Seattle. Russia says one woman died [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=268.8s)]
*  and nine others were injured after Ukraine launched a wave of drone attacks on its neighboring border [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  region of Kursk. From Moscow, NPR's Charles Maines has details. Russian authorities in Kursk say the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  region was subjected to a massive enemy attack overnight. Russia's defense ministry said its air [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  defenses shot down more than 100 drones over the skies of Kursk, claims it could not be independently [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=291.2s)]
*  confirmed. Yet video posted online showed several apartment buildings on fire, or with significant [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  damage from explosions. The apparent Ukrainian attack comes just days after two Russian missiles [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=302.08s)]
*  struck the Ukrainian city of Sumi, killing several dozens of civilians and injuring scores more, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=307.12s)]
*  according to Ukrainian officials. Russia has defended the attack as a strike on a nearby [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=312.32s)]
*  gathering of Ukrainian military officers, but presented no evidence. Charles Maines, NPR News, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  Moscow. Lawmakers in Hungary have passed an amendment to the country's constitution. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=322.88s)]
*  It will let the Hungarian government ban public events held by the LGBTQ community. The amendment [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=328.16s)]
*  has been pushed through the Hungarian parliament. Backers say efforts to protect children [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=334.8s)]
*  supersede all other rights. That includes the right for the public to assemble. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  Paige Becker's is the top pick in this year's WNBA draft. Just over a week ago, she helped win the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=344.88s)]
*  college national championship with the Yukon Huskies. Now she's heading to the Dallas wings [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=351.68s)]
*  to start her professional career. NPR's Becky Sullivan prepared this report. The number one [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=356.88s)]
*  pick this year was no surprise. The Dallas wing select Paige Becker's, University of Connecticut. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=362.4s)]
*  The 23 year old Becker's has been a top talent since she was a high schooler. At Yukon, she lived [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  up to expectations when she wasn't sidelined by injuries. She won national player of the year [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=375.6s)]
*  awards in 2021, reached four final fours and finally cut down the nets with a national title [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=379.84s)]
*  earlier this month. Even as she was expected to go number one, she felt grateful afterwards, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=385.44s)]
*  she said. I mean, you don't ever want to assume anything in life. Nothing is guaranteed sort of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=390.64s)]
*  for this moment to be here. It's nerve wracking. You just have a level of excitement. The WNBA [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpEl08AW10Y&t=394.88s)]
