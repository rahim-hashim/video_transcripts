# Boeing's Machinists Vote To Go On Strike | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04)
*  President Biden meets with the British prime minister today about the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=0.0s)]
*  And Springfield, Ohio, received a bomb threat after former President Donald Trump repeated a lie about the city's Haitian community. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=4.4s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=11.6s)]
*  President Biden meets British Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. They'll talk about Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=16.1s)]
*  Ukraine's president wants to use Western missiles to hit targets deep inside Russia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=21.2s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin says if Ukraine does this, it will mean Russia is at war with NATO allies. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=25.8s)]
*  Earlier this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Iran for sending missiles to Russia that Moscow could fire deep into Ukrainian territory. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=32.2s)]
*  Terry Schulz explains. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=40.7s)]
*  Western countries' fears that they would be seen as escalating the conflict by letting Ukraine have these deeper strike capabilities [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  has now been superseded by what Blinken described as Moscow's own escalatory action in teaming up with Tehran to get these ballistic missiles. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=49.3s)]
*  Of course, that hasn't stopped Putin from continuing to threaten the West, including just yesterday, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  that he would view a change in the position on these weapons as direct involvement in the war. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=62.3s)]
*  Terry Schulz reporting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=67.1s)]
*  Unionized machinists at Boeing plants in Portland and the Seattle area went on strike overnight. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=68.8s)]
*  They voted down a tentative contract and are demanding wage increases. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=74.1s)]
*  The Biden administration is announcing new rules to try to clamp down on unfair trade practices. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=78.8s)]
*  And Piers Asmohallit explains these particularly focus on China. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=84.5s)]
*  The way current U.S. trade law works is that shipments valued at less than $800 are allowed into the United States through something called the de minimis exemption. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  That means those imports are not subject to taxes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=98.0s)]
*  But the White House says that system has been abused. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=101.1s)]
*  A decade ago, about 140 million shipments were coming through this exemption. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=104.1s)]
*  Now it's more than a billion. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=108.6s)]
*  The administration wants to make sure any imports covered by existing tariffs on Chinese goods are not being exempted through this de minimis rule. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=111.0s)]
*  The White House seems to be specifically trying to crack down on Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shien and Tmoo, known for selling cheap fast fashion. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  Asmohallit, NPR News. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  FBI agents in Springfield, Ohio continue to investigate a bomb threat in the downtown area. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=129.6s)]
*  This comes after former President Donald Trump pushed a false slur claiming that Springfield's Haitian community is stealing and eating pets. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=135.7s)]
*  This is not true. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=144.6s)]
*  For Member Station WYSO, Catherine Mobley has more. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=147.0s)]
*  A morning bomb threat Thursday evacuated and closed city, county and state offices. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  Now religious and community leaders are urging residents to look beyond their differences and work together. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=156.5s)]
*  This is Pastor Vilis Dorsonville, Director of the Haitian Community Help and Support Center. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=162.8s)]
*  We hope that if we still stand together and we believe in each other, and one day we will be the beacon of the world as a community in Springfield. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=167.5s)]
*  The debunked rumors appear to have conflated an animal cruelty case by an American citizen in another Ohio city, and then spread in far-right Facebook groups. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=177.3s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Catherine Mobley in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3v0Jhi2S04&t=191.0s)]
