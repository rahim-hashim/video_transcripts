# White House Hosts Discussions On Abortion Access | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I)
*  The Biden administration is marking the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine with fresh sanctions against Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=0.0s)]
*  And more than 700,000 utility customers are still without power in Michigan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=6.5s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman with NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=11.8s)]
*  Today's the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=16.8s)]
*  President Biden will be meeting virtually this morning with leaders of G7 nations and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  The Biden administration has also announced fresh sanctions on more than 200 people and entities supporting Russia's military goals. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=27.3s)]
*  NPR's Joanna Kikissis is in Kyiv and says Western allies have been providing support to Ukraine for months. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=34.9s)]
*  The West has given Ukraine billions in military and humanitarian aid. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=41.7s)]
*  Western weapons have helped Ukrainian forces hit Russian targets and reclaim occupied territory. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  And Western aid has helped Ukraine restore some of its power grid after it was almost destroyed during months of Russian strikes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=52.7s)]
*  NPR's Joanna Kikissis reporting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=61.0s)]
*  More than 700,000 utility customers in Michigan don't have electricity, according to tracking site PowerOutage.us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=63.5s)]
*  A winter storm buried that northern state in ice. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=71.5s)]
*  From member station WDET, Quinn Kleinfelter reports. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=74.3s)]
*  Utility officials say the relatively rare combination of an ice storm, freezing rain and sleet overwhelmed repair crews at first. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=78.1s)]
*  But the head of DTE Electric, Trevor Lauer, says reinforcements have arrived. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  We have an army out here. We are going to restore your power from Michigan to Lake Erie. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  We have wires down. Some of those are going to be live and you need to treat every wire like it is a live wire. Stay away from it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  A live wire killed a firefighter in southeastern Michigan during the storm. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=104.0s)]
*  The fire department says he was hit by a power line when ice suddenly caused a tree branch to break and knocked the wire down. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=107.9s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Quinn Kleinfelter in Detroit. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, there is now a blizzard warning in effect for parts of southern California. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=117.7s)]
*  This hasn't happened in more than 30 years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=122.4s)]
*  Mountainous roads just outside Los Angeles may be impassable because of heavy blowing snow. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=125.4s)]
*  The access to medication abortion in the future in the U.S. is uncertain. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=131.4s)]
*  And Vice President Harris is preparing to host a meeting with reproductive rights advocates today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=136.3s)]
*  As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, the gathering at the White House comes on the same day as a key deadline in a federal lawsuit that could cut off access to a major abortion pill. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Vice President Harris has been tasked with leading the Biden administration's efforts to respond to increasing threats to abortion rights, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  especially in the aftermath of last summer's Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  a decision from a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas is expected soon in a lawsuit challenging the most widely used form of medication abortion in the U.S. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=164.1s)]
*  That drug, Mifepristone, was approved by the FDA more than 20 years ago. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=173.0s)]
*  The vice president will meet with legal and medical experts and discuss threats to both Mifepristone and what the White House describes as the authority of the FDA. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=177.6s)]
*  Sarah McCammon, NPR News. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=186.7s)]
*  And you're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2_hX1Cth-I&t=188.79999999999998s)]
