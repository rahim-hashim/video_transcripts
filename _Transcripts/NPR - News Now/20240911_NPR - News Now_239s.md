# Taylor Swift Endorses Harris After Tuesday's Debate | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, September 11th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=0.0s)]
*  here are today's top stories. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=5.24s)]
*  sparred for 90 minutes last night in their debate in Philadelphia. Trump worked to link [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=9.48s)]
*  Harris to President Biden's record, especially on immigration. But NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Levin [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=14.0s)]
*  reports Trump repeatedly lied when he was questioned about issues such as reproductive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=18.64s)]
*  rights and abortion in the U.S. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  He spewed several lies about abortion. He said that some states allow infanticide. That [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=25.44s)]
*  is not true. He says over and over that all legal experts wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Again, not true. He says this is where people wanted it. He wouldn't give an answer on an [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  abortion ban. It was maybe the issue on which he failed the most against her. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=42.96s)]
*  NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Levin reporting. Pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Harris shortly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=47.92s)]
*  after the debate ended. NPR's Elena Moore reports Swift posted her endorsement on Instagram, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=53.4s)]
*  where she has 280 million followers. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=58.36s)]
*  Taylor Swift has entered her 2024 election era. Accompanying a photo of her holding her [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  cat, Swift wrote on Instagram that Harris is a, quote, steady-handed gifted leader. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=67.08s)]
*  It's unclear what impact Swift's endorsement could have, but it may boost enthusiasm for [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=73.08s)]
*  Harris as she works to gain support from voters under 30. That's a generation that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=78.4s)]
*  has known the country-turned-pop star for most of their lives. To put a finer point [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  on it, Swift's debut album from the fall of 2006 is nearly the same age as an 18-year-old [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=87.76s)]
*  eligible voter today. Elena Moore, NPR News, Philadelphia. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Ukraine with Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=98.76s)]
*  The two are on a joint visit to the capital, Kiev. Ukraine's president is pressing the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=103.64s)]
*  allies to help lift restrictions on the use of long-range missiles. These have been provided [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=108.36s)]
*  by Western allies for defense purposes. Ukraine wants to use the weapons to strike military [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=114.16s)]
*  targets deep inside Russia. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=119.8s)]
*  Hurricane Francis is bearing down on the Louisiana coast with winds of 90 miles per hour. It [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=122.88s)]
*  became a Category 1 hurricane last night. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports it is on a track to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=127.68s)]
*  make landfall by this evening near Morgan City as a Category 2 storm. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=133.28s)]
*  President Biden has approved an emergency declaration for Louisiana freeing up federal [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=138.96s)]
*  resources as the state readies for Hurricane Francine. The National Hurricane Center says [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=143.24s)]
*  the storm will bring a life-threatening coastal storm surge of up to 10 feet in some areas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=148.68s)]
*  Flash flooding is also a threat in a region that's already saturated. And Francine will [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=154.72s)]
*  bring hurricane-force winds capable of toppling trees and power lines in damaging buildings. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=159.84s)]
*  Officials in New Orleans and Baton Rouge have urged residents to shelter in place, while [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  some coastal parishes have established curfews and ordered evacuations of vulnerable communities. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=171.08s)]
*  Debbie Elliott, NPR News, New Orleans. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=178.08s)]
*  The search continues for Joseph Couch. He is the suspect in a Saturday shooting along [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=181.32s)]
*  a Kentucky interstate that left five people injured. From member station WUKY, Josh James [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=185.84s)]
*  reports schools remain closed in the areas as the search stretches into its fourth day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=192.44s)]
*  Kentucky State Police Trooper Scotty Pennington says despite a flood of calls from in and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=198.08s)]
*  outside the state, police have no evidence Couch has escaped the heavily wooded area [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=202.72s)]
*  under surveillance. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=207.76s)]
*  There's so many people that's got eyes on this investigation around the world that by [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=208.76s)]
*  now we should have got a pretty good tip that he has exited the woods. We have not [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=215.76s)]
*  got that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=219.16s)]
*  Police aren't speculating about whether Couch remains alive, but their assumption is that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=220.16s)]
*  he is and remains armed and dangerous. Reward money leading to his arrest has now been bumped [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=224.44s)]
*  up to $35,000. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFYL2S3Z3h8&t=230.04s)]
