# Pandemic-Era Immigration Policy Title 42 Ends | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y)
*  The pandemic era policy known as Title 42 expired last night and Elon Musk says he's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  lined up a new CEO for Twitter. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=6.88s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=9.56s)]
*  Migrants at the southern U.S. border are finding a different set of immigration rules today [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=15.06s)]
*  after the pandemic related immigration policy known as Title 42 expired last night. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=19.76s)]
*  That policy allowed authorities to quickly expel people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=26.14s)]
*  Today new rules mean migrants have to make an appointment to get an asylum hearing, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=29.6s)]
*  but many communities are bracing for an increase of people and some officials say they're not [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=33.6s)]
*  prepared to provide food and shelter. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=38.08s)]
*  Yuma Arizona Mayor Doug Nicklaus is calling on the White House for more help. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  This is a federal issue. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  This is not a local issue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=47.28s)]
*  It needs to be addressed directly by the federal government. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=49.32s)]
*  Mr. President, declare a national emergency and get real solutions on our border for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=52.92s)]
*  our communities and for Yuma. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=58.4s)]
*  The president has sent 1,500 military troops down to the U.S. border to observe and maintain [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=61.08s)]
*  safety. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=66.6s)]
*  Elon Musk says he's lined up a new Twitter CEO to start in about six weeks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=67.6s)]
*  He didn't name the person, although his tweet refers to his replacement as a quote she. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=73.16s)]
*  Rachel Myro of Member Station KQED has more. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=78.0s)]
*  Musk tweeted he'll transition to executive chair and chief technology officer of Twitter, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=80.88s)]
*  apparently making good on a promise to abide by the results of a poll he posted in December. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=85.96s)]
*  In that poll, he asked if he should step down as head of Twitter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  17.5 million people weighed in and more than 57 percent of them clicked yes. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=94.8s)]
*  But he still owns the company he renamed X back in April. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  And given his penchant for public joking about Twitter, many doubt the mercurial multi-billionaire [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=104.72s)]
*  will ever really relinquish total control. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=110.16s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Rachel Myro. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=113.56s)]
*  This week, Virginia became the eighth state to pull out of a national bipartisan voting [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  collaborative. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  As Ben Paver of Member Station VPM reports, the partnership has been the target of right-wing [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  conspiracy theories. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=128.36s)]
*  The Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, allows states to share voter information [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=130.32s)]
*  when people move or die and was set up by officials from both parties. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=135.52s)]
*  But it's become the target of right-wing conspiracy theories falsely claiming the system [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=139.9s)]
*  was being orchestrated by left-wing activists. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=143.94s)]
*  In a statement, Virginia's Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin argued ERIC was expensive and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  questioned its security measures. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=151.82s)]
*  Virginia Delegate Marcus Simon, a Democrat, says the net result will be worse voter information. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=154.3s)]
*  Yeah, like I said, this is like a full-maga move. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  It's really disturbing to see happening in Virginia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  Republican officials in Texas, Florida, and Ohio have all pulled their states out of ERIC [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=165.66s)]
*  in recent months. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=169.78s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Ben Paver in Richmond. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=171.46s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5li2kDq4Y&t=174.62s)]
