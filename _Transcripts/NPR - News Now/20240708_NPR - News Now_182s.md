**NPR - News Now:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, July 8th. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=0.0s)]
*  Hurricane Barrel has made landfall this morning on the Gulf Coast of Texas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=6.28s)]
*  The storm's top sustained winds are at 75 miles per hour. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=10.28s)]
*  It's pounding the area around Matagorda County, Texas. Mitch Thanes is the county's public information officer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=14.32s)]
*  The winds are really, really strong right now. We're in the eye right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=21.2s)]
*  We understand we're ready. We're bracing for the back half of that hurricane. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=25.52s)]
*  Forecasters are warning of life-threatening storm surge. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=30.24s)]
*  They say that in some areas along the coast, water could surge in from the sea and reach a height of up to seven feet. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=33.6s)]
*  There are storm surge warnings up to the Texas-Louisiana state line. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=40.84s)]
*  Heavy rain is triggering flood watches and warnings, but flood watches are starting to be posted as far north as southern Indiana. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  Hurricane Barrel is expected to break up as it streams north across the U.S. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=52.84s)]
*  Several senior House Democrats have told their congressional leadership that President Biden should step aside as the party's nominee for president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=58.6s)]
*  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports they spoke in a leadership call yesterday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=66.56s)]

*  according to two sources familiar with the private call on Sunday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=75.92s)]
*  New York Democrats Jerry Nadler and Joe Morelli, California Congressman Mark Tucano, and Washington state Congressman Adam Smith [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=79.92s)]
*  were the latest to push for the president to withdraw. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=87.64s)]
*  Five House Democrats have publicly called for the president to step aside [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  in the days since the president's poor performance in the debate against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  But the party is divided on the path forward. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=101.64s)]
*  The president says he's staying in the race and insists he can beat Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=104.44s)]

*  Results are in from France's latest round of elections this weekend. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=110.84s)]
*  Left-wing and centrist candidates won an unexpected victory over the far right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=115.08s)]
*  But now comes the difficult task of governing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=120.24s)]
*  There are three competing blocs and no majority in the new French parliament. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=122.76s)]

*  Analysts say there will need to be compromise to create a working government. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=137.0s)]
*  But far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, part of the leftist coalition, took an immediate hard line. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=140.6s)]
*  The president must bow down and admit his defeat, he said to supporters. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=145.96s)]
*  The left's entire program should be adopted immediately. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  Our right icon Marine Le Pen, whose party came in last, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=157.36s)]
*  called it unnatural how the centrist and the left sacrifice many of their own candidates in the second round just to block her party. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  Analysts say the center and left will have a harder time agreeing on a new governing coalition as their differences are significant. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=169.72s)]
*  Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Civw6nH9j58&t=176.23999999999998s)]
