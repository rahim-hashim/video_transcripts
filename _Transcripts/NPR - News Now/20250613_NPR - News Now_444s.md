# Israel Continues Strikes As Trump Urges Iran To Make A Deal | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo)
*  Israel continues to attack sites across Iran today, and an appeals court has blocked a judge's earlier ruling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=0.0s)]
*  It allows President Trump to continue to command the California National Guard for now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=6.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=11.0s)]
*  Israel continues to launch significant military strikes against Iran today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=15.8s)]
*  These began overnight, targeting Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=20.3s)]
*  Three top Iranian generals have also been killed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=24.5s)]
*  Iran has fired scores of drones back at Israel. There are no reports of damage in Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=27.5s)]
*  President Trump is urging Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program after the Israeli attacks. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=34.0s)]
*  As NPR's Franco Ortonius reports, Trump says that he warned Iran that it will, quote, only get worse. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=39.5s)]
*  In his first comments since Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=46.5s)]
*  Trump took to social media where he said he told Iran to, quote, make a deal before there is nothing left. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=52.5s)]
*  Israel launched airstrikes into Iran Friday, killing top Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=58.5s)]
*  The attacks targeting Iran's nuclear program are considered the biggest in decades and raise concerns of leading to a deadlier conflict. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=65.5s)]
*  Trump told followers that he gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal on its nuclear program [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=73.5s)]
*  and warned that the alternative would be, quote, much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=80.0s)]
*  Franco Ortonius, NPR News. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=86.0s)]
*  241 people perished yesterday aboard the Air India plane in western India when it crashed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=89.0s)]
*  Several people who were on the ground were also killed. However, one British male passenger survived the crash. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=96.0s)]
*  The BBC has spoken to his cousin, as NPR's Lauren Freyer reports, from London. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=102.0s)]
*  Speaking to the BBC outside his home in Leicester in the British Midlands, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=107.5s)]
*  Ajay Valgi says two of his cousins were on the Air India flight that crashed just after takeoff in western India. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=111.5s)]
*  One of them, Vishwas Kumar Ramesh, managed to climb out of the wreckage and call his family in Britain. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=119.5s)]
*  He only said that he's fine, nothing else. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=126.5s)]
*  He just said he's fine, his cousin says, and that he was still searching for his brother who'd been in the seat next to him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=128.5s)]
*  From his hospital bed, Ramesh told an Indian newspaper that, quote, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=135.0s)]
*  30 seconds after takeoff there was a loud noise and the plane crashed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=138.0s)]
*  There were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran, he was quoted as saying. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=143.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, London. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=149.0s)]
*  President Trump continues to retain the power to put National Guard troops in Los Angeles. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=151.0s)]
*  He deployed the military to support immigration enforcement actions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=156.0s)]
*  California officials sued him and a federal district court judge agreed, thus blocking Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=160.5s)]
*  But later, a federal appeals court stepped in, blocking the lower court order and restoring the power to the president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=165.5s)]
*  From Los Angeles, Steve Futterman explains how the case started. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=172.5s)]
*  Earlier, District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that control of National Guard troops in Los Angeles [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=175.5s)]
*  must revert back to California Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=180.5s)]
*  The order was set to take effect at noon, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=184.5s)]
*  delaying the order so it can review the case. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=190.0s)]
*  In his ruling, Breyer said Trump's actions were illegal, exceeding his authority. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=193.0s)]
*  Newsom says he expects the ruling to be upheld. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=198.0s)]
*  We push back against overreach. We push back against these authoritarian tendencies. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=201.0s)]
*  Trump claimed his action was legal because he was trying to suppress a rebellion. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=206.0s)]
*  The judge had rejected the argument saying the protests in LA fall far short of a rebellion. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=211.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=217.5s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blames California Senator Alex Padilla for interrupting her news conference yesterday. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=220.5s)]
*  She and Padilla were both in the same building in Los Angeles. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=227.5s)]
*  She was talking about immigration raids. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=230.5s)]
*  Padilla said he moved toward Noem to ask a question when he was forcibly removed from the room by federal agents, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=233.0s)]
*  forced to the ground, and then handcuffed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=239.5s)]
*  Padilla had a warning. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=241.5s)]
*  If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=244.0s)]
*  you can only imagine what they're doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=250.0s)]
*  But Secretary Noem says it was Senator Padilla who lunged toward her during the news conference. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=259.0s)]
*  She says he never identified himself. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=264.0s)]
*  Several recordings of the incident show Padilla identifying himself in the room before he is taken away. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=266.0s)]
*  An immigrant wrongly deported from the United States to El Salvador months ago is due in court today in the U.S. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=273.0s)]
*  The arraignment of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia comes more than a month after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered President Trump to facilitate his return. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=280.5s)]
*  From member station WPLN, Mariana Bacallao has more. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=289.5s)]
*  Prosecutors say that Kilmar Abrego-Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=293.5s)]
*  and that for the past 11 years he's been moving people without legal status from Texas to Maryland. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=299.0s)]
*  Garcia's attorney has said he's skeptical of the charges, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=305.0s)]
*  as his client's wrongful deportation has sparked criticism of the Trump administration's immigration policy. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=308.5s)]
*  Garcia will be arraigned in Nashville because his charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=315.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Mariana Bacallao in Nashville. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=323.0s)]
*  The U.S. will celebrate the anniversary of the U.S. Army tomorrow with a massive parade in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=327.5s)]
*  It's also President Trump's birthday tomorrow. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=333.5s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports some defense experts worry that could blur a line between patriotism and politics. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=336.5s)]
*  While the event is officially billed as a celebration of the military's 250th anniversary, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=344.5s)]
*  some experts say the optics are complicated by its timing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=350.5s)]
*  Yvonne Chu is a professor at the Naval War College. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=356.0s)]
*  She says holding the parade on the president's 79th birthday has raised some questions. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=359.0s)]
*  The White House and supporters of the administration say they see the parade as a tribute to the nation's armed forces. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=365.5s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News, Washington. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=385.5s)]
*  The New York sexual assault trial against former Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein has ended with a mixed outcome. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=389.0s)]
*  Ilya Meretz reports Weinstein was convicted on one count, acquitted on another, and a mistrial has been declared on a third charge. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=395.0s)]
*  The mistrial was on the count of rape in the third degree. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=403.0s)]
*  In his first trial in 2020, Weinstein was convicted of the same charge. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=406.0s)]
*  But this time, the fractious jury could not reach a verdict. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=410.0s)]
*  The jury foreman told the court he felt physically unsafe. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=413.0s)]
*  Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg said he is ready to try Weinstein again on the rape charge. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=416.5s)]
*  A Weinstein spokesman wrote in a statement, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=421.5s)]
*  Weinstein's first New York conviction was overturned last year on procedural grounds. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=430.5s)]
*  He also has a sex crimes conviction in California. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=434.5s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Ilya Meretz. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TadVN6a6Vo&t=437.5s)]
