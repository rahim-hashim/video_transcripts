# Under New Rule, Credit Reports Won't List Medical Debt | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, January 7th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=3.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris is announcing a new rule today by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=7.0s)]
*  It will remove medical debt from credit reports. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=12.0s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid tells us it's estimated this move could affect millions of Americans. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=15.0s)]
*  Tens of millions of people in the United States are saddled with medical bills they cannot pay, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=20.0s)]
*  sometimes forcing them to drain their savings. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=25.0s)]
*  For this new rule, medical debt will no longer be listed on anyone's credit report. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=28.0s)]
*  The White House says today's rule will remove $49 billion in unpaid medical bills from people's credit reports. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=33.0s)]
*  This means some people may see their credit scores improve and have an easier time receiving a mortgage. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=40.0s)]
*  The CFPB has made going after medical debt a priority, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=45.0s)]
*  but some congressional Republicans have long criticized the agency, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=49.0s)]
*  and it's not clear what will happen in a new Trump administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=53.0s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=57.0s)]
*  The body of former President Jimmy Carter will be moved from Atlanta to Washington today. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=59.0s)]
*  The state funeral for the nation's 39th president will take place Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=63.0s)]
*  Ahead of the service, Carter will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=69.0s)]
*  As Steve Futterman reports, Carter died late last month at the age of 100. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=73.0s)]
*  The flag-draped casket here at the Carter Center since Saturday will be removed by military body bearers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=78.0s)]
*  The casket will be placed on board one of the presidential planes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=84.0s)]
*  For this trip, though, it will not be called Air Force One, but rather Special Air Mission 39. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=88.0s)]
*  All night long in temperatures near freezing, a steady flow of people continued to walk past the casket. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=94.0s)]
*  He was truly a man who lived a good life and put people first, and that's what matters. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=100.0s)]
*  Rachel Gowan brought her two young children. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=105.0s)]
*  It was great to be able to have them see all of the things that he did. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=107.0s)]
*  Once in Washington, the body will be placed on a horse-drawn caisson and taken to the Capitol where it will lie in state. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=110.0s)]
*  The casket will lie on the same catafalque that held the casket of Abraham Lincoln. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=117.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Atlanta. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=122.0s)]
*  The Biden administration has sent 11 detainees held in the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Oman. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=125.0s)]
*  Biden's been trying to close the facility before he leaves office. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=132.0s)]
*  The Pentagon says all of them are former al-Qaeda members who've been detained for more than 20 years without being charged. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=136.0s)]
*  NPR's Sasha Pfeiffer says reaction to the decision is coming along political lines. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=142.0s)]
*  Republicans claim this is like releasing terrorists. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=147.0s)]
*  Democrats say this should have happened a long time ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=150.0s)]
*  It's a moral stand on America, they say. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=152.0s)]
*  This is complicated by the new fresh upheaval in the Middle East because there's some concern these men could end up back on a battlefield somewhere. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=155.0s)]
*  But remember, national security officials have made the decision these men no longer pose a significant threat. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=162.0s)]
*  NPR's Sasha Pfeiffer reporting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=168.0s)]
*  Chinese state media say a powerful earthquake in Tibet not far from Mount Everest has killed at least 95 people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=170.0s)]
*  There have been dozens of aftershocks reported. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=178.0s)]
*  A powerful winter storm is pulling away from the mid-Atlantic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=181.0s)]
*  The system dumped heavy snow and ice from the central plains and the east over the past few days. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=184.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of flights were canceled yesterday. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=189.0s)]
*  Schools, government offices and businesses were closed from Missouri to Delaware. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=192.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the two newly arrived giant pandas at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. have been seen playing in the snow. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=197.0s)]
*  The National Zoo has posted video of the pair, but they will not make their official public debut until January 24th. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=204.0s)]
*  This is NPR News. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86euzLcX5lY&t=212.0s)]
