# Trump Suggests He Might Support Nationwide 15-Week Abortion Ban | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E)
*  Congressional leaders have released the final spending package to fund the government through the end of this fiscal year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=0.0s)]
*  And former President Donald Trump has suggested he could support a nationwide 15-week abortion ban. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=12.0s)]
*  Congressional leaders have released the second and final bipartisan package of six appropriations bills for this fiscal year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=16.0s)]
*  As NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports, this sets up a race against the clock for lawmakers to pass the bills before a deadline late tomorrow night. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=23.0s)]
*  The $1.2 trillion package funds the federal government until the end of the fiscal year on September 30. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=31.0s)]
*  The package is compromise legislation, with both Republicans and Democrats touting policy wins. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=38.0s)]
*  Republicans point to the increased number of ICE detention beds and a boosting of funding for border protection technology. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=43.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats are pointing to a $1 billion increase for child care and early learning programs. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=50.0s)]
*  Now that the text is released, the question becomes whether Congress can vote on the package before the deadline Friday at midnight. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=56.0s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he expects the House will vote on Friday, which puts lawmakers on a narrow timeframe to read and approve the bills. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=63.0s)]
*  Barbara Sprunt and PR News, Washington. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=71.0s)]
*  The federal judge will sentence two former Mississippi law enforcement officers today for their role in the racial torture of two black men last year. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=74.0s)]
*  A total of six ex-officers pleaded guilty. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=83.0s)]
*  The former officers were part of a so-called goon squad. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=86.0s)]
*  And Piers Debyelli reports two more of these ex-officers were sentenced yesterday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=90.0s)]
*  The judge called the former officer's actions egregious and despicable as he doled out the latest stiff sentences. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=95.0s)]
*  Former Rankin County Sheriff's Deputy Christian Dedmon got 40 years and ex-Deputy Daniel Opdyck got 17 and a half for their roles in the attack on Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker last January. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=102.0s)]
*  The black men were subjected to racist slurs, beatings and sexual assault. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=116.0s)]
*  One deputy shot Jenkins in the mouth and a mock execution went awry. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=121.0s)]
*  Debbie Elliott, NPR News. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=126.0s)]
*  The presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested he could support a national 15-week abortion ban. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=129.0s)]
*  NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Lehman reports Trump has yet to spell out his exact stance on the issue. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=137.0s)]
*  Trump made the comments on the conservative New York talk radio show Sit and Friends in the Morning. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=143.0s)]
*  The number of weeks now people are agreeing on 15 and I'm thinking in terms of that and it'll come out to something that's very reasonable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=148.0s)]
*  But people are really even hardliners are agreeing seems to be 15 weeks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=158.0s)]
*  He added that he supports exceptions for pregnancies that threaten a parent's life as well as pregnancies due to incest and rape. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=163.0s)]
*  Throughout the campaign, Trump has resisted taking a position on what kind of federal abortion ban he would support, instead saying he would broker a bipartisan compromise on the topic. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=170.0s)]
*  He also told the host he would be making an announcement on his abortion policy, quote, at the appropriate time. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=180.0s)]
*  Danielle Kurtz-Lehman, NPR News. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB4m5NopV2E&t=187.0s)]
