*  the U.S. access to minerals that are essential for aviation and defense technology. Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62s0bz_2Rv4&t=26.8s)]
*  also sees it as a chance for the U.S. to recoup some of the billions of dollars that U.S. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62s0bz_2Rv4&t=32.88s)]
*  taxpayers have spent helping Ukraine defend itself against the Russian invasion. The progress [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62s0bz_2Rv4&t=37.28s)]

*  Their attorney argued that the Trump administration and specifically the Office of Personnel Management [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62s0bz_2Rv4&t=89.39999999999999s)]
