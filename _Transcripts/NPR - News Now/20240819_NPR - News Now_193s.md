# Chicago Prepares For Protests Outside The DNC This Week | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U)
*  Chicago police are preparing for thousands of protesters outside the Democratic National Convention this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=0.0s)]
*  And Secretary of State Antony Blinken is pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza during his visit to Israel today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=6.0s)]
*  I'm Kristen Wright from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=12.0s)]
*  The Democratic National Convention opens today in Chicago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=16.0s)]
*  The Harris Walls ticket is looking to build on recent momentum. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=20.0s)]
*  President Biden will give the keynote address tonight. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=24.0s)]
*  Chicago police meanwhile are preparing for thousands of protesters. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=27.0s)]
*  NPR's Martin Kosty says there's already tension over the official protest route. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=31.0s)]
*  The coalition to march on the DNC represents a variety of causes but primarily an end to U.S. support for Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=37.0s)]
*  They say the city has allowed them a parade route that's far too short for the expected number of protesters. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=44.0s)]
*  And spokesman Hatem Abu Daya has hinted that the marchers may have no choice but to depart from the official route. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=50.0s)]
*  But he says they won't be violent. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=56.0s)]
*  The only worry about violence is the worry about violence coming from Chicago police and other law enforcement. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=58.0s)]
*  Chicago police superintendent Larry Snelling says officers will protect protesters' right to free speech. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=66.0s)]
*  But he says he won't guarantee there won't be arrests if they break the law. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=71.0s)]
*  Martin Kosty, NPR News. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=75.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party is putting an emphasis on reaching voters online. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=77.0s)]
*  For the first time, vertical streams of the convention will be available on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=82.0s)]
*  As NPR's Alaina Moore reports now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=89.0s)]
*  The Democratic National Convention Committee says the party's programming will be streamed on over a dozen platforms. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=91.0s)]
*  The goal, according to the committee, is to reach, quote, more Americans than ever before. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=97.0s)]
*  But having vertical streams on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube for the first time has an added weight. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=102.0s)]
*  It's a prime spot to reach younger voters who may not otherwise tune in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=108.0s)]
*  And that's a voting bloc that handily backed President Biden in 2020 and that Vice President Harris needs in her camp again. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=112.0s)]
*  Alaina Moore, NPR News, Chicago. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=119.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump and running mate Senator J.D. Vance are spending the week campaigning in several key states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=122.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken calls right now a decisive moment for the war in Gaza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=133.0s)]
*  NPR's Michelle Kalman reports he's in Israel trying to push for a ceasefire and a hostage deal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=139.0s)]
*  This is Blinken's ninth visit to the region since the Hamas attack on Israel last October. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=146.0s)]
*  And he calls this, quote, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get hostages held by Hamas home. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=152.0s)]
*  I'm here as part of an intensive diplomatic effort on President Biden's instructions to try to get this agreement to the line and ultimately over the line. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=160.0s)]
*  It is time for it to get done. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=168.0s)]
*  The U.S., along with Egypt and Qatar, put proposals on the table last week to bridge differences between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire and a hostage deal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=170.0s)]
*  Blinken is urging all sides to avoid an escalation and focus on diplomacy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=180.0s)]
*  Michelle Kalman, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=185.0s)]
*  This is NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4BW_NA3a5U&t=188.0s)]
