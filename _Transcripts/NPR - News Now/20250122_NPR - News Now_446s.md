# Trump Ends Federal DEI Programs, Orders Staff Be Placed On Leave | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4)
*  The Trump administration has approved areas such as schools, hospitals and churches for federal immigration raids and the administration has also ordered that federal DEI staff be placed on paid leave by the end of today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=14.0s)]
*  There's no word yet of any major federal immigration raids that are expected to target cities that say they will protect migrants living illegally in the U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=18.0s)]
*  But NPR's Ximena Bustillo says the Trump administration has laid groundwork for these arrests in places that were previously prohibited. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=27.0s)]
*  Old rules said that schools as well as places of worship, health care facilities and a list of other areas were off limits for arrests of people suspected of being without legal status. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=34.0s)]
*  Now acting Secretary of Homeland Security has rescinded those guidelines, which the Trump administration says limit law enforcement from doing its job. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=46.0s)]
*  NPR's Ximena Bustillo reporting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=55.0s)]
*  Separately, several states are suing the Trump administration. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=57.0s)]
*  This is over Trump's executive action trying to overturn birthright citizenship. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=60.0s)]
*  It's enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=65.0s)]
*  President Trump has issued another executive order, this time ending federal programs dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=68.0s)]
*  NPR's Ayanna Archie reports employees of these programs have been put on paid administrative leave. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=75.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is moving quickly to reevaluate federal DEI programs. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=81.0s)]
*  Agencies have until this evening to tell employees in those programs that they will be placed on paid leave with benefits. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=86.0s)]
*  They also have until then to remove all DEI references from websites and social media. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=92.0s)]
*  Trump also wants agency employees to let his administration know if there are any plans to conceal DEI initiatives through vague language. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=97.0s)]
*  The president says these programs cause division, promote discrimination and drain taxpayers' dollars. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=106.0s)]
*  Agencies have until Thursday to report their compliance to the administration and until the end of the month to come up with a broader plan to reduce the workforces for these programs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=112.0s)]
*  Ayanna Archie, NPR News. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=121.0s)]
*  Trump is also blaming the Federal Aviation Administration for hiring people with, quote, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=123.0s)]
*  serious infirmities that could impact life-saving duties. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=129.0s)]
*  He insists there are people who want to work for the FAA but don't have a requisite disability or the right skin color. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=133.0s)]
*  Trump has offered no evidence of his allegations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=140.0s)]
*  President Trump's nominee to be defense secretary is facing more allegations of misconduct. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=143.0s)]
*  In a sworn statement to the Senate, the former sister-in-law of Pete Hegseth accuses him of being abusive to his second wife. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=148.0s)]
*  And Piers Luke Garrett reports. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=155.0s)]
*  Hegseth, the former wife of Hegseth's brother, says the defense secretary nominee, quote, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=158.0s)]
*  In her affidavit, reviewed by NPR News, she says at times Hegseth's second wife hid in a closet from him out of fear. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=165.0s)]
*  Daniel Hegseth submitted the affidavit in response to a request from Democratic Senator Jack Reid of Rhode Island. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=172.0s)]
*  The ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee called the affidavit, quote, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=178.0s)]
*  disturbing and potentially disqualifying. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=182.0s)]
*  On Monday, the committee endorsed Pete Hegseth's nomination along party lines, paving the way for a vote in the full Senate. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=185.0s)]
*  A lawyer for Hegseth dismissed these allegations to NBC News. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=191.0s)]
*  NPR has requested comment from Hegseth. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=195.0s)]
*  Luke Garrett, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=197.0s)]
*  Former President Joe Biden and President Trump have used their executive powers to pardon hundreds of people just this week. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=200.0s)]
*  NPR's Martin Costey reports two major police organizations say they are discouraged by the actions. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=207.0s)]
*  In an unusual joint statement, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police say they're not happy with recent clemency actions for people convicted of harming law enforcement officers. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=214.0s)]
*  The most dramatic case of this was President Trump's pardon of nearly all the people arrested or convicted of crimes during the assault on the Capitol four years ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=225.0s)]
*  Michael Fanon was a D.C. cop caught up in that and he's angry. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=234.0s)]
*  You know, at the end of the day, the whole idea of backing the blue and the intern is all just crap. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=238.0s)]
*  The joint statement also cites clemency actions by President Biden, which include the commutation of the life sentence of Leonard Peltier, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=245.0s)]
*  the Native American activist convicted of killing two FBI agents 50 years ago. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=253.0s)]
*  Martin Costey, NPR News. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=258.0s)]
*  Fire crews continue to battle wildfires in the Los Angeles region. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=260.0s)]
*  These have killed at least 28 people this month and destroyed more than 15,000 structures. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=264.0s)]
*  President Trump plans to travel to Los Angeles on Friday to view the fire damage for himself. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=271.0s)]
*  NPR's Tamara Keith reports the president is talking about linking disaster relief funds to other legislation that he wants passed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=276.0s)]
*  Trump met with Republican congressional leaders to discuss extending and expanding tax cuts and surging resources to immigration enforcement. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=285.0s)]
*  Asked about how Republicans would get that done, Trump brought up the wildfires in Los Angeles. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=293.0s)]
*  It's been in some ways made simpler by Los Angeles because they're going to need a lot of money. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=299.0s)]
*  And generally speaking, I think you find that a lot of Democrats are going to be asking for help. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=304.0s)]
*  So I think maybe that makes it more one sided. I think we're going to do very well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=310.0s)]
*  Look, we're going to take care of Los Angeles. I'm going there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=315.0s)]
*  Trump plans to stop first in North Carolina, where hurricane recovery efforts are still underway. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=318.0s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=324.0s)]
*  Forecasters say a winter storm is still pounding the southeast from northern Florida to southern Virginia. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=326.0s)]
*  Areas in between, from Jacksonville to Virginia Beach, could get about three inches of snow in all. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=332.0s)]
*  Areas on the Gulf Coast got a lot more than that yesterday. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=337.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service says New Orleans got eight inches of snow and nearby places got even more. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=340.0s)]
*  NPR's Debbie Elliott reports the weather has affected travel and business. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=346.0s)]
*  The Gulf South is seeing snow like it's never had before, prompting snowmen on the beach and people skiing down Bourbon Street in New Orleans. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=350.0s)]
*  But Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry warns treacherous conditions remain in a region not used to dealing with icy roads. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=359.0s)]
*  Again, this winter wonderland that we're seeing right now is going to end and a hard freeze is going to begin. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=367.0s)]
*  So the fun is going to come to a quick end. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=375.0s)]
*  Government offices, schools and many businesses are closed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=379.0s)]
*  The storm has also disrupted shipping at the ports of Houston and New Orleans. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=384.0s)]
*  Debbie Elliott, NPR News. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=389.0s)]
*  The Food and Drug Administration has expanded its approval of the antidepressant nasal spray Spravato. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=391.0s)]
*  NPR's John Hamilton reports that the drug is now cleared for use as a standalone treatment for depression. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=397.0s)]
*  Spravato is made from esketamine, one of two mirror image molecules found in the anesthetic ketamine. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=404.0s)]
*  It was approved in 2019 for use in adults with major depressive disorder who did not respond to at least two other antidepressants. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=410.0s)]
*  The original approval required that patients on Spravato also receive an oral antidepressant. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=418.0s)]
*  Now the FDA says the drug can be used on its own. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=423.0s)]
*  The decision came after a large study found that Spravato alone worked better than a placebo. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=426.0s)]
*  In the first nine months of 2024, the drug generated sales of about $780 million for its maker, Johnson & Johnson. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjy4tXXA2x4&t=432.0s)]
