# 2 Ballot Drop Boxes Set On Fire In Washington, Oregon | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58)
*  Hundreds of ballots were damaged when two ballot drop boxes were set on fire in Oregon and Washington State yesterday and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's Parliament has banned operations for the UN's main aid agency for Palestinians. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=6.8s)]

*  Vice President Harris will speak from Washington, DC tonight in what's being billed as her closing argument to voters one week before election day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=16.52s)]
*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, the venue is symbolic with ties to January 6th and then President Donald Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=24.16s)]
*  Harris will speak from the ellipse with the White House illuminated in the background. When Trump spoke there on January 6th, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=31.0s)]
*  he was trying to cling to power. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=37.68s)]
*  Now Harris is trying to make sure he never again stands behind the seal of the President of the United States. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=39.56s)]
*  According to her campaign, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=45.88s)]
*  Harris plans to argue that voters have a choice between someone who will always put himself first and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=47.36s)]
*  her, someone who will put the American people first. The campaign says this argument is less about history and more about making a case [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=53.0s)]
*  that the country can move on from the Trump era. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=61.24s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=64.4s)]

*  We really just want to acknowledge the heightened emotion around this event as we build up to the election. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ7DQxaBh58&t=108.11999999999999s)]
