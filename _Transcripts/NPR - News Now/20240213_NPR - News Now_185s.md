# Talks Continue Toward A New Pause In The Fighting In Gaza | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, February 13th. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The Senate has passed a foreign aid package that offers financial support to Israel, Ukraine, and some Pacific nations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  The vote was 70 to 29. A group of Republican senators filibustered the bill all night trying to slow it down. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=12.8s)]
*  They're opposed to the aid package. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  Even though it has passed the Senate this morning, House Republicans have warned they are likely to torpedo the foreign aid bill. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=21.6s)]
*  Voters in some New York City suburbs are heading to the polls today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=28.48s)]
*  They're deciding who should replace expelled Congressman George Santos. From member station [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=31.8s)]
*  WSHU, Desiree DiOrio has more. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=36.84s)]
*  The tight race is a toss-up between Republican Mazie Pillip and Democrat Tom Swazi in the district just east of New York City. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=39.84s)]
*  Swazi is running for his old job. He represented the district for six years as a moderate Democrat. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Pillip started her political career just a few years ago when she was elected to the local legislature. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=53.64s)]
*  The seat is open because the House voted last year to expel George Santos over ethical and campaign finance violations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Desiree DiOrio on Long Island. Voters in New York could have a hard time getting to the polls today. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=66.88s)]
*  There's a significant winter storm that could drop several inches of snow. The storm warnings range from West Virginia to Massachusetts. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=73.2s)]
*  President Biden says the U.S. is continuing to discuss a potential deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=82.08s)]
*  This could lead to a six-week pause in fighting in Gaza. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=88.48s)]
*  Biden says the discussions also include proposed increased aid to Palestinian civilians and the release of hostages held by Hamas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=92.4s)]
*  The key element of the deals are on the table. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=100.48s)]
*  There are gaps that remain, but I've encouraged Israeli leaders to keep working to achieve the deal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=103.48s)]
*  The United States will do everything possible to make it happen. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  Biden spoke during a White House visit by Jordan's King Abdullah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=112.32s)]
*  Biden also emphasized that Israel should not proceed with a military operation in the southern city of Rafa without a, quote, credible plan to protect Palestinian civilians. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=116.32s)]
*  More than a million Palestinians are crammed into Rafa for safety against Israeli strikes. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=127.96s)]
*  The United Kingdom is imposing sanctions against four Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  That falls rather follows a similar move by the United States and bears Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=140.12s)]
*  The U.K.'s Foreign Office said it was imposing an asset freeze and entry ban against four settlers accused of attacking Palestinian shepherding communities or families picnicking in the West Bank. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=147.4s)]
*  The U.K. announcement said Israel had not followed through on commitments to stop settler violence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=158.12s)]
*  One of the sanctioned settlers called the move anti-Semitic. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=163.08s)]
*  His brother was killed in action as a soldier in Gaza. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=165.96s)]
*  Just last week, the U.S. imposed similar sanctions against four Israeli settlers, including one the U.K. has now sanctioned. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Some saw their Israeli bank accounts closed as a result. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=176.36s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=179.4s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUMH1gN5NsQ&t=181.64000000000001s)]
