# Some Democrats Push Biden To Use 14th Amendment, TikTok Creators Fight Montana Ban | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4)
*  Some lawmakers are urging the president to take an unprecedented step to end the debt ceiling dispute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=0.0s)]
*  And TikTok creators in Montana are fighting back against a statewide ban of the app. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=11.0s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is going to make an appearance at the G7 meeting this weekend in Japan. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=16.0s)]
*  But NPR's Anthony Kuhn says it's not yet clear if he'll be there in person. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=22.0s)]
*  The head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council told National TV that Zelensky needs to be here in Hiroshima because important decisions will be made. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=26.0s)]
*  But Zelensky's office says he'll attend virtually. Japan's government hasn't confirmed either option. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=35.0s)]
*  At any rate, G7 meetings leading up to today's summit have already seen officials recommit to supporting Ukraine militarily and financially for as long as it takes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=40.0s)]
*  NPR's Anthony Kuhn reporting. The Ukrainian president is in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=50.0s)]
*  Zelensky is going to attend the summit of the Arab League. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=55.0s)]
*  A group of Democrats is urging President Biden to use the 14th Amendment to raise the nation's debt ceiling. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=58.0s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports the unprecedented move could potentially allow Biden to override Congress on the grounds that their failure to lift the borrowing limit is unconstitutional. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=64.0s)]
*  The effort is being led by Senator Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=75.0s)]
*  They say the spending cuts that House Republicans are demanding in exchange for raising the debt ceiling are unacceptable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=80.0s)]
*  In a letter to President Biden, the lawmakers are urging him to invoke the 14th Amendment, which says in part, the validity of the public debt shall not be questioned. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=87.0s)]
*  That's something that has never happened before and would likely face legal challenges. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=97.0s)]
*  Biden is continuing negotiations with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy during his trip to the G7 summit in Japan this week. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=101.0s)]
*  He's expected to address the debt ceiling when he returns to Washington on Sunday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=109.0s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=113.0s)]
*  Montana is the first state to ban the video sharing app TikTok. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=116.0s)]
*  From Montana Public Radio, John Hooks reports users of the app have now asked a court to strike down the ban. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=120.0s)]
*  The plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Montana are five creators on the video sharing app who live in the state and say their large followings on the platform [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=126.0s)]
*  have allowed them to build communities and earn a living. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=136.0s)]
*  They're arguing a ban on the social media platform is unconstitutional on free speech grounds and asking the court to strike it down. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=140.0s)]
*  TikTok itself is not part of this case, but the company has indicated it is prepared to go to court as well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=148.0s)]
*  Montana's attorney general says they expected legal challenges and are prepared to defend the law. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=155.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm John Hooks in Butte. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=161.0s)]
*  Today's the funeral for Jordan Neely in New York. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=164.0s)]
*  The black man died on a city subway when a fellow rider pinned him to the floor in a choke hold. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=167.0s)]
*  Neely's family says he had mental illness and had been homeless. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=172.0s)]
*  Civil rights activist Al Sharpton will give the eulogy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=176.0s)]
*  The man accused of pinning Neely, Daniel Penny, has been charged with manslaughter. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=180.0s)]
*  Penny's lawyers say he acted to protect himself and others. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=185.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TXTNTCxUx4&t=189.0s)]
