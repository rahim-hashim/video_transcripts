*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=11.84s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=12.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris has accepted her party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=16.0s)]
*  in Chicago. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=20.52s)]

*  for governing the country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=25.52s)]

*  are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=40.4s)]
*  right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=47.040000000000006s)]

*  Negotiators are working on a proposal presented last week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=62.08s)]
*  It's meant to narrow the gaps between the two sides. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=65.28s)]
*  As NPR's Hadil Al-Shelchi reports, a deal may take more time than expected to reach. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=68.48s)]

*  While the U.S. has tried to convey optimism, Hamas and Israel have downplayed a deal is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=94.72s)]
*  close. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=99.28s)]
*  Both sides continue to blame each other for stalling. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8bhF8Fhc6s&t=100.28s)]
