# U.N. Climate Summit Ends With Historic Call To Move Away From Fossil Fuels | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, December 13th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=0.0s)]
*  Negotiators at the UN Climate Conference in Dubai say they've reached a final agreement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=7.0s)]
*  They claim it marks the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=11.5s)]
*  But as NPR's Nathan Rott reports, not all of the nearly 200 countries present are happy with the outcome. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Climate activists and representatives from some of the world's most vulnerable countries, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=21.5s)]
*  those that have contributed the least to global warming have been calling for this summit to result in a strong global commitment to ending the use of climate warming fossil fuels. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=26.4s)]
*  Simon Steele, the executive secretary of UN Climate Change, acknowledged that was not fully accomplished after angry comments by the island nation of Samoa. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=35.4s)]
*  The fact they received the longest standing applause is a clear indication these views are widely shared. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=44.4s)]
*  Stronger ambition and follow through, he says, are needed to avert more human suffering. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=52.4s)]
*  Nathan Rott, NPR News, Dubai. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=58.4s)]
*  Ukrainian President Zelensky was back on Capitol Hill yesterday urging lawmakers to approve more money for his war against Russia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=60.4s)]
*  But NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports Republicans insist the aid must be paired with U.S. border security. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=67.4s)]
*  President Zelensky met with senators from both parties and House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=73.4s)]
*  GOP lawmakers say any new money must be tied to policy changes to address the significant uptick in migrants entering the U.S. illegally at the southwest border. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=78.4s)]
*  Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy is leading bipartisan talks on immigration reforms. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=88.4s)]
*  He warns what's at stake if Congress doesn't approve the money for Ukraine. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=93.4s)]
*  If we don't stand by Ukraine, we give a green light for Vladimir Putin to march into Ukraine and perhaps through into Europe. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=98.4s)]
*  With both chambers scheduled to head home at the end of the week, it's unlikely the funding bill will pass before the end of the year. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=108.4s)]
*  Deirdre Walsh, NPR News, The Capitol. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=115.4s)]
*  House Republicans are pushing for a vote as soon as today to open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=118.4s)]
*  They say they're investigating alleged corruption but have never provided any direct evidence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=124.4s)]
*  Separately, the president's son, Hunter Biden, has been subpoenaed by a House panel and is scheduled to appear today behind closed doors. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=129.4s)]
*  He has said he would only testify publicly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=136.4s)]
*  That has been rejected by Republican committee members. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=139.4s)]
*  The Arizona Supreme Court is weighing contradictory laws on abortion. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=142.4s)]
*  One law would ban the procedure after 15 weeks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=147.4s)]
*  That's another law dating back to the Civil War without law abortions entirely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=150.4s)]
*  Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays says that if that stringent law is upheld, she won't prioritize using it to prosecute Arizona doctors. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=155.4s)]
*  I can't fathom a situation in which our Supreme Court wants to take us back to 1864, but we will see and we'll deal with that when it's over. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=164.4s)]
*  The law was adopted decades before Arizona became a state. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=177.4s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Kol5mO8po&t=181.4s)]
