# ICE Arrests Student Activist at Columbia University | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE)
*  A student activist at New York's Columbia University has been arrested by federal immigration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=0.0s)]
*  agents and Canada will soon swear in a new prime minister. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=5.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=9.38s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=10.38s)]
*  A student activist who helped lead pro-Palestinian student protests at Columbia University in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  New York has been arrested by federal immigration agents. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=18.88s)]
*  A lawyer for Mahmoud Khalid said he was taken away and his location has not been disclosed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Khalid is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. but was told his green card is being [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=27.76s)]
*  revoked. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=33.0s)]
*  And Pierce Adrian Florido reports this is in line with a vow from President Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=34.0s)]
*  In late January, President Trump signed an executive order that he said would be used [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=38.52s)]
*  to go after students who participated in, in his words, the pro-Jihadist protests. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=42.24s)]
*  It directed federal agencies to work toward deporting international students who participated. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=48.18000000000001s)]
*  The order cited federal law that allows deporting foreign nationals who express support for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=53.6s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=58.36s)]
*  Students have always rejected A, the claim that their protests were pro-terrorists or [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=59.96s)]
*  that they supported Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=63.44s)]
*  They say the protests were for peace in Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=66.8s)]
*  And Pierce Adrian Florido reporting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=69.2s)]
*  House Republicans are shoring up support for a stopgap government funding bill. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=71.64s)]
*  It's backed by President Trump. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=75.68s)]
*  The measure largely keeps the government funded by using last year's budget numbers. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=77.32s)]
*  House Democrats say they will oppose it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=81.92s)]
*  NPR's Susan Davis says Congress only has until the end of the week to pass spending legislation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=84.16s)]
*  where the government will partially shut down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=89.36s)]
*  The House is expected to vote on Tuesday and if they can't pass a bill, the shutdown becomes [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  exponentially more likely by Friday. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  If they can pass that hurdle, a handful of Democrats are still going to be necessary [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  to get it through the Senate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=102.64s)]
*  At least one of those Democrats, Pennsylvania's John Fetterman, has indicated he'll be on [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=104.04s)]
*  board. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  It's unclear if others will be. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  And Trump is already trying to put the blame on Democrats if there is a shutdown. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=109.76s)]
*  But I think that's going to be a bit of a hard sell when it's his party that controls [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=114.0s)]
*  all the levers here and have also made clear that Democrats didn't have a seat at the table. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=116.92s)]
*  NPR's Susan Davis reporting. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=121.04s)]
*  President Trump says the reciprocal terrace he plans to impose next month might just be [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=123.2s)]
*  the beginning. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=127.72s)]
*  And Pierce Chamberlain reports the president says there could be some pain ahead for the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=128.84s)]
*  U.S. economy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump made the comments in a sit-down interview on the Fox News program Sunday Morning Futures [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=134.52s)]
*  with Maria Bartiromo. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=139.06s)]
*  Are you expecting a recession this year? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=140.86s)]
*  I hate to predict things like that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=145.22s)]
*  There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=147.66s)]
*  We're bringing wealth back to America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=152.56s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  And there are always periods of ... it takes a little time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=156.58s)]
*  He dismissed concerns raised by business leaders that the on-again, off-again tariffs in recent [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=161.34s)]
*  have created uncertainty, saying that's just a talking point. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=166.73999999999998s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration's cost-cutting effort is looking at shedding hundreds of federal [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  government buildings. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=176.62s)]
*  That could include selling them or canceling leases. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=178.12s)]
*  And PR Stephen Fowler says this will affect taxpayers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=181.42s)]
*  Almost all of these buildings are actually outside of D.C. and a lot of them provide [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=185.14s)]
*  public services. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=189.14s)]
*  I mean, think about how many people need to interact with the IRS and Social Security. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=190.14s)]
*  There are more than 100 buildings on this list from those two agencies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  There's also disparate impact on rural areas like the Farm Service Agency and Forest Service [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=198.56s)]
*  within the Agriculture Department and Interior Department bureaus like the National Parks [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=203.46s)]
*  and the Fish and Wildlife Service. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=207.88s)]
*  NPR Stephen Fowler reporting. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=209.52s)]

*  Mark Carney won the race to lead Canada's governing Liberal Party yesterday. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=214.12s)]
*  Under Canada's parliamentary system, Carney will take over from outgoing Prime Minister [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=219.0s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, also a Liberal. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=223.56s)]
*  But Carney is expected to soon call national elections. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  In a speech to fellow party members, he identified a threat to Canada's prosperity. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=229.32s)]
*  Donald Trump, as we know, has put, as the Prime Minister just said, unjustified tariffs [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=234.84s)]
*  on what we build, on what we sell, on how we make a living. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=242.32s)]
*  He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=248.48s)]
*  President Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico last week. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=256.0s)]
*  Then he gave U.S. automakers a one-month reprieve. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=261.0s)]

*  peace. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=301.48s)]

*  president in the Oval Office with cameras rolling. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nUlbY24LIE&t=314.52000000000004s)]
