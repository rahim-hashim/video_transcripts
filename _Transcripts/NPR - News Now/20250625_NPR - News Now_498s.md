# NATO Members Agree To Massive Increase In Defense Spending | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ)
*  President Trump says the intelligence on the success of U.S. military strikes in Iran over the weekend is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  inconclusive and NATO members have agreed to a massive increase in spending on defense and security. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=6.36s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=11.96s)]
*  Leaders at the NATO summit in the Netherlands have agreed to spend far more money on defense spending. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=16.52s)]
*  President Trump has pushed each country to commit to spending five percent of its GDP every year for defense and security. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  The massive spending increase is supposed to happen within a decade. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  The NATO leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to the alliance's principle of mutual self-defense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=32.92s)]
*  That is, an attack on one NATO country is considered an attack on all of them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=39.52s)]
*  President Trump says he thinks it will be decades before Iran can rebuild its nuclear program. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  This is after a U.S. strike over the weekend targeted three Iranian nuclear sites. Trump first said the strikes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=50.32s)]
*  obliterated the sites, but NPR's Deepa Shivram reports today, he's saying the intelligence on the strikes is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=56.72s)]
*  inconclusive. Trump made these latest comments during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte kicking off the last day of the NATO summit. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  Well, the intelligence was very inconclusive. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=70.36s)]
*  The intelligence says we don't know. It could have been very severe. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is with Trump at the NATO summit, said an early intelligence report indicated moderate to severe damage at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=76.6s)]
*  Fordow, the main nuclear site that was hit. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=84.28s)]
*  And he says it's more likely severe, but he also says the report was preliminary and low confidence. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  The president said they're waiting on a report from Israel that will outline the extent of the damage from the U.S. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  strike on Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  Deepa Shivram, NPR News, The Hague. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=100.0s)]
*  Oil prices closed at nearly $68 a barrel yesterday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  That price is lower than it was before Israel attacked Iran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  That may be due to the fact that a ceasefire between the countries appears to be holding. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=110.28s)]
*  But as NPR's Camilla Domenoski reports, the decrease in oil prices started well before the word of the truce. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=114.44s)]
*  Oil analysts and traders are increasingly confident that the Strait of Hormuz is not likely to be closed to tanker traffic. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  Susan Bell is with Rice Dad Energy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  That the markets have made the call that I don't want to say the conflict is over, but the risk of the conflict is much lower now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=130.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, the world was already awash in too much oil anyway. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=139.64s)]
*  Supply is outstripping demand. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  And unlike in decades past, the U.S. is the world's number one producer, which reduces dependence on the Middle East and means [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  conflicts like this don't prompt as extreme a market response as they once would. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  Camilla Domenoski, NPR News. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=158.32s)]
*  President Trump is claiming credit for the Israel-Iran ceasefire. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  He's been billing himself as a peacemaker since he reentered office in January. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  As NPR's Greg Myrie reports, Trump's track record on resolving conflicts so far has been mixed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=168.44s)]
*  President Trump has become directly involved in three separate conflicts in recent months. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=174.48s)]
*  The Israel-Iran truce appears fragile, but seems to be holding for now after 12 days of fighting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=179.48s)]
*  However, the Israel-Hamas battle in Gaza grinds on. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  There was a truce when Trump took office, but it collapsed when Israel launched an offensive in March. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=189.48s)]
*  On another front, Trump is in the Netherlands for a NATO summit where the Russia-Ukraine war is a top priority. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=195.12s)]
*  Trump promised a quick end to that conflict, but the fighting has only intensified mostly because Russia has stepped up air strikes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=201.76s)]
*  More than a dozen Ukrainians were killed in the latest missile attack. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=209.64s)]
*  Greg Myrie, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=213.68s)]
*  The leader in the vote count for New York City's Democratic primary election for mayor is state assemblyman Zaron Mumdani. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=216.92s)]
*  He swept about 44 percent of the vote, but he did not earn more than 50 percent of the vote. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=223.88s)]
*  New York City used ranked choice method for voting for the first time, and an outright winner needs a majority. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=229.55999999999997s)]
*  Still, Mumdani says he will be New York's Democratic nominee for mayor this year. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=235.88s)]
*  Together, we have shown the power of the politics of the future. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=241.04s)]
*  One, one of partnership and of sincerity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=248.27999999999997s)]
*  Mumdani came in well ahead of former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=252.64s)]
*  The former governor has already conceded defeat. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=256.88s)]
*  The Republican candidate is Curtis Sliwa. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=260.08s)]
*  Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=262.4s)]
*  Civil Liberties groups plan to challenge a new Texas law. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=266.32s)]
*  It requires that the Ten Commandments be displayed in all public school classrooms. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  Some of the same groups recently won a similar challenge in Louisiana. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=274.36s)]
*  From Houston Public Media, Andrew Schneider reports. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=278.96s)]
*  Supporters say the Commandments are the basis of U.S. law and should be posted in schools. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  But a federal appeals court ruled last week that Louisiana's similar law is unconstitutional. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=287.44s)]
*  Rachel Lazar, who heads Americans United for Separation of Church and State, says the Texas law is too. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=293.32s)]
*  There are limits on the free exercise of religion. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  In other words, the government cannot favor one set of religious views over any others or religion over non-religion. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  Americans United is the financial supporter of NPR. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=309.68s)]
*  Lazar says her group and others are also considering suing Texas over another new law, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=313.44s)]
*  which would let school districts set aside time for students and faculty to pray or read religious scripture. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=318.56s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Andrew Schneider in Houston. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=324.48s)]
*  The nation's top safety investigators say multiple failures are to blame for the mid-air door plug blowout of a Boeing jet last year. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=327.64s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports the National Transportation Safety Board met in Washington yesterday and reviewed the results of a lengthy investigation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=335.84s)]
*  The chair of the NTSB, Jennifer Homendy, started the meeting by praising the crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=344.0s)]
*  who got all 177 people on board safely back to Portland International Airport after the mid-air blowout. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  But Homendy faulted Boeing for not having more robust safety procedures in place. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=356.96s)]
*  The crew shouldn't have had to be heroes because this accident never should have happened. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=361.48s)]
*  Homendy also praised Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over last year for renewing the company's focus on safety. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  But she said there is still more work to do. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=373.96000000000004s)]
*  Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=376.32s)]
*  The makers and sellers of wedding dresses are expressing concerns about their costs in the wake of President Trump's global tariffs. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=378.56s)]
*  They're asking the administration to protect formal wear from the new levies. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=386.36s)]
*  NPR's Alina Seljuk reports most bridal gowns sold in the United States are made abroad. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=390.64s)]
*  China is by far the biggest hub for bridal gowns and not just dresses, but also trims and crystals, veils and hair pieces. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=396.76s)]
*  Many brands have already started raising prices to offset tariff costs. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=404.04s)]
*  Some stores are still absorbing them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=408.32s)]
*  Others have begun charging brides. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=410.16s)]
*  Chelsea Richie, who is dress shopping in Los Angeles, is getting warnings of likely tariff surcharges. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=412.28000000000003s)]
*  Maybe an additional I'm hearing somewhere between two hundred dollars to a thousand dollars. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=417.36s)]
*  It really just depends on the price. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=422.04s)]
*  But I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  That was a pretty big blow to hear. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=426.4s)]
*  The Bridal Retailers Association says tariffs will not bring gown making jobs to the U.S. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=428.56s)]
*  given the highly limited pool of skilled craftsmen for hand beading, embroidery or lace work. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=433.4s)]
*  Alina Seljuk, NPR News. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=439.44s)]
*  A SpaceX capsule carrying a crew of four is on its way to the International Space Station. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=441.2s)]
*  It launched before dawn today at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  The four private astronauts from the U.S., India, Poland and Hungary will now spend about two weeks in orbit. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=450.32s)]
*  Brendan Byrne has this report. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=456.56s)]
*  It's the fourth mission brokered by the Houston, Texas based company Axiom Space. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=458.52s)]
*  The company works with SpaceX for rides to the station and coordinates with NASA for the usage of the International Space Station for its astronauts. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=463.2s)]
*  The mission comes after multiple delays, most recently after NASA investigated repairs to a leak on the space station. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=470.36s)]
*  Now launched, it will take a little more than a day to catch up with and dock to the station. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=476.48s)]
*  The crew will spend about 14 days living and working aboard the space station conducting dozens of science experiments. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=481.16s)]
*  After the time on orbit, they'll return to Earth and their capsule splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Brendan Byrne in Orlando. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avCdXZN8RTQ&t=491.96000000000004s)]
