# Investigators Learn More About New Orleans Attack Suspect | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o)
*  Investigators continue to piece together information about the suspect in yesterday's deadly attack in New Orleans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=0.0s)]
*  And President-elect Trump says he wants to help states ban homeless encampments wherever possible. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=12.24s)]
*  Authorities are learning more about the man believed to have killed 15 people yesterday and wounded 35 more [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  when he drove a truck into New Orleans crowds. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Shamsu Dean Jabbar was shot and killed by police. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=24.82s)]
*  The Texas newsroom's Lauren McGahee reports Jabbar spent more than a decade in the U.S. military. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=28.44s)]
*  State records show Jabbar dabbled in real estate, starting a couple of businesses in Texas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=33.96s)]
*  In a now-deleted video posted to YouTube, Jabbar said his time in the U.S. Army and Reserves taught him to, quote, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=38.88s)]
*  take everything seriously, dotting I's and crossing T's to make sure that things go off without a hitch. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=44.96s)]
*  After the military, Jabbar attended Georgia State University and got a degree in computer information systems [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=51.5s)]
*  and more recently worked at Deloitte. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=57.18s)]
*  Addressing the tragedy yesterday, President Joe Biden said Jabbar posted videos to social media in the hours before the attack, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=59.63999999999999s)]
*  expressing a desire to kill on behalf of ISIS. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=66.32s)]
*  I'm Lauren McGahee in Austin, Texas. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=69.56s)]
*  The FBI says agents found more weapons and what seemed to be an explosive device in Jabbar's truck, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=71.8s)]
*  and authorities found more such devices in other parts of New Orleans. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  These have been rendered safe. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=82.28s)]
*  Officers are also carefully searching the Superdome. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  That's where the Sugar Bowl was supposed to be played yesterday. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=87.4s)]
*  That game has been postponed until this afternoon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=90.48s)]
*  Separately, authorities in Las Vegas are trying to learn more about a cyber truck that exploded yesterday in front of the Trump Hotel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=93.68s)]
*  The driver was killed when gasoline canisters and mortar-style fireworks exploded in the vehicle. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  Jeremy Schwartz is the FBI agent in charge and says officials have not identified the driver. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=106.48s)]
*  Our number one goal is to ensure that we have the proper identification of the subject involved in this incident. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  Following that, our second objective is to determine whether this was an act of terrorism or not. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=117.76s)]
*  I know everybody's interested in that word and trying to see if we can say, hey, this is a terrorist attack. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  That is our goal and that's what we're trying to do. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=127.64s)]
*  They also don't know if there is any evidence linking the incident in Las Vegas with the attack in New Orleans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=129.44s)]
*  President-elect Trump wants to overhaul how the United States manages record high homelessness. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=137.04s)]
*  As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, Trump says he'll work with states to ban homeless encampments wherever possible. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump has said camping bans would help push people into treatment for drug addiction or mental problems. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=149.16s)]
*  Billions in federal homeless spending aims to get people into housing first, then help them deal with any other problems. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  But Devin Kurtz with the conservative Cicero Institute says that's led to a shortage of addiction and mental health programs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=162.36s)]
*  It's housing, housing, housing, housing. They don't want anything else. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=169.12s)]
*  We just find that to be sort of foolish given the scale of unsheltered homelessness right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  Advocates for those who do not have a home of their own say the housing first approach has a proven track record and that forcing treatment does not work. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=178.0s)]
*  Jennifer Ludden, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=186.72000000000003s)]
*  New York City police are investigating a mass shooting that happened last night outside a nightclub in Queens. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  Authorities say 10 people were injured by several men who opened fire on them and fled. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=195.16s)]
*  The victims range in age between 16 and 20. There were no fatalities. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=200.16s)]
*  Police say the shooting is not related to terrorism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=204.72s)]
*  And you're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnICam5ff0o&t=208.07999999999998s)]
