*  March. That law also gives police powers to use facial recognition tools to [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaTdM4WV4cs&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  identify individuals that attend prohibited events. Legal experts say the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaTdM4WV4cs&t=414.18s)]
*  law and the amendment violate Hungary's Constitution and could be used to ban [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaTdM4WV4cs&t=418.18s)]
*  public assemblies by any group in the future. Rob Schmitz, NPR News, Warsaw. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaTdM4WV4cs&t=422.34s)]
