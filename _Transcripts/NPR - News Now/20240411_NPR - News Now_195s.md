# U.S. Weighs Dropping Espionage Charges Against Assange | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI)
*  The Justice Department is going to require background checks on all gun sales in the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=0.0s)]
*  And yesterday, Arizona Republicans blocked an effort to repeal a near total ban on abortions in that state. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=5.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=11.5s)]
*  The Justice Department says it's going to require federal background checks for the sale of all guns in the U.S., [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=15.8s)]
*  not just those sold at gun stores. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=21.3s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaraman reports the DOJ is seeking to close the so-called gun show loophole. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=23.3s)]
*  The new rule from the Justice Department means that guns sold at gun shows, at flea markets, or on social media [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=29.3s)]
*  would all require background checks before purchase. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=36.3s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=39.3s)]
*  says the rule will keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who have been convicted of violent felonies. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=44.3s)]
*  The rule is part of the bipartisan legislation on gun violence that President Biden signed into law in 2022. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=51.3s)]
*  The DOJ estimates the rule will affect roughly 23,000 unlicensed gun dealers in the U.S. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=58.3s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=65.3s)]
*  Republicans in the Arizona House of Representatives shut down an effort by Democrats yesterday [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=67.3s)]
*  to overturn a law that imposes a near total abortion ban. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=73.3s)]
*  The law dates back to the Civil War, before Arizona was a state. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=77.3s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers chanted, shame, shame. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=81.3s)]
*  Activists are working to put the question of abortion rights on the November ballot in the state. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=84.3s)]
*  Democratic State Senator Anna Hernandez says Republicans will lose the question [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=89.3s)]
*  and possibly key districts in the Arizona legislature. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=94.3s)]
*  And the voters of Arizona that already agree that we should have safe abortion access [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=98.3s)]
*  are going to show that through the polls. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=104.3s)]
*  This week, the Arizona State Supreme Court ruled the abortion ban can take effect in a couple of weeks. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=106.3s)]
*  President Biden says the U.S. is considering dropping espionage charges against the founder of WikiLeaks. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=112.3s)]
*  Today marks five years that Julian Assange has been in a London prison. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=118.3s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Freire reports from London he's awaiting extradition to the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=122.3s)]
*  In a video on social media, Stella Assange, the WikiLeaks founder's wife, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=127.3s)]
*  reminisces about Australia where her husband was raised. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=131.3s)]
*  But cycling through Melbourne like he used to do, or feeling his bare feet sink into the cool sand. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=134.3s)]
*  Australia has asked the U.S. to drop charges against Assange. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=141.3s)]
*  President Biden says his government is considering that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=145.3s)]
*  The espionage charges date back to WikiLeaks 2010 publication of classified files related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=148.3s)]
*  The Army analyst who leaked them, Chelsea Manning, did prison time and was freed under then President Obama. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=156.3s)]
*  Assange's next court hearing here in London is May 20th, which could serve as a deadline for any U.S. decision. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=162.3s)]
*  Lauren Freire, NPR News, London. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=169.3s)]
*  Israel's military says it's preparing to open a new land crossing into northern Gaza. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=171.3s)]
*  Israel will allow more aid into the region that monitors say is falling into famine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=176.3s)]
*  The Biden administration demanded more aid after Israel killed seven workers with a food charity last week. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=181.3s)]
*  Israel says that was an error. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=187.3s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaLO_4E5PI&t=190.3s)]
