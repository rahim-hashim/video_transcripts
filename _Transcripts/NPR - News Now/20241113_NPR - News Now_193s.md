# Biden Hosts Trump At The White House Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c)
*  President Biden will host President-elect Donald Trump at the White House today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=0.0s)]
*  And a match between French and Israeli soccer teams will go ahead tomorrow night, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=3.84s)]
*  despite recent violence around a soccer match in Amsterdam. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=7.84s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=11.68s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump will be visiting his past and future office today, the Oval Office. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, President Biden extended the invitation after Trump's election win last week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=21.68s)]
*  President Biden has said he wants a peaceful and orderly transfer of power, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=28.0s)]
*  and this ceremonial meeting is part of that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=32.56s)]
*  But it's a courtesy Trump didn't offer Biden four years ago. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=35.36s)]
*  Trump still hasn't acknowledged that he lost the 2020 election, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=39.6s)]
*  and didn't attend Biden's inauguration either. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=43.76s)]
*  Back in 2016, Trump was wowed by his Oval Office meeting with then-President Obama, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=46.96s)]
*  calling him a very good man, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=52.96s)]
*  and raving about the meeting lasting far longer than the 15 minutes he said had been scheduled. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  When Trump and Biden met on the debate stage in June, it essentially ended Biden's political career. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=60.72s)]
*  So for both, this meeting comes with baggage. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be his defense secretary. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Hegseth served in the Army National Guard and led a veteran advocacy organization. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=78.64s)]
*  Some commentators say Hegseth does not have senior national security experience. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=83.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump also says he'll nominate former Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=89.12s)]
*  to be director of the CIA. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=94.16s)]
*  As NPR's Greg Meyrie reports, Ratcliffe held a top intelligence post [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=96.16s)]
*  in the final year of Trump's first term in office. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=100.72s)]
*  Trump has again turned to Ratcliffe as the president-elect moves quickly to shape his foreign policy and national security teams. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=103.76s)]
*  Ratcliffe was considered one of the most conservative members of Congress [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  and a staunch Trump loyalist when he was tapped to be director of national intelligence in 2020. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Democrats said he lacked experience in national security and was chosen for his unwavering support for Trump. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=120.48s)]
*  If Ratcliffe is confirmed, he'll be the first person who has served as both director of the CIA [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=127.04s)]
*  and director of national intelligence, which oversees all the intelligence agencies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=132.96s)]
*  Greg Meyrie, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=138.48s)]
*  The French government says it will go ahead with a France-Israel soccer match tomorrow night, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=141.28s)]
*  despite anti-Semitic violence around a recent match in Amsterdam. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=146.24s)]
*  As NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, France has Europe's largest Jewish and Muslim communities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=150.72s)]
*  French officials have been vigilant in keeping the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from being exported to France. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=156.56s)]
*  But French Interior Minister Bruno Retaillot said they cannot give in to threats of anti-Semitism. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=163.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the debate raged on television talk shows, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=169.04s)]
*  whether the Amsterdam violence was purely anti-Semitic or motivated in part by the war in Gaza [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=172.4s)]
*  and provocative Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  President Emmanuel Macron will be there, he says, to send a message of fraternity and solidarity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=181.68s)]
*  Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTxWFTquz6c&t=186.88s)]
