*  and addressing trade imbalances besides lowering their own import taxes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=56.28s)]

*  Israelis are gathered in front of a large screen in downtown Tel Aviv awaiting Alexander's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=92.94s)]
*  release. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=97.42s)]

*  Yehuda Cohen's son is a hostage in Gaza. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=108.78s)]

*  We need you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=116.53999999999999s)]

*  airplane that could temporarily serve as Air Force One. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  But as NPR's Franco Ortonius reports, the idea is already raising ethical and legal questions. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=144.18s)]
*  The White House has acknowledged that the Qatari government has offered to donate a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=150.06s)]
*  plane to the Department of Defense. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=153.82s)]
*  ABC was first to report about the plane. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  If it happens, the plane would be one of the biggest foreign gifts ever received by the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=158.58s)]
*  U.S. government. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=163.22s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt issued a statement saying that any gift given by a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=164.54s)]
*  foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=168.94s)]
*  The president is traveling to the Middle East this week and will stop in Qatar, as well [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  But administration officials say not to expect the gift to be presented or accepted this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=181.78s)]
*  week while the president is in Qatar. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=186.26s)]
*  Franco Ortonius, NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=188.98s)]
*  Pope Leo XIV met with members of the media today at the Vatican. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=192.5s)]
*  NPR's Jason DeRose reports from Rome, the pontiff thanked journalists for their service [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=196.78s)]
*  to the truth. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=201.66s)]
*  Pope Leo began his remarks on a lighter note in English following a round of applause from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=202.66s)]
*  guests. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=207.66s)]
*  They say when they clap at the beginning, it doesn't matter much. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=208.66s)]
*  If you're still awake at the end and you still want to applaud, thank you very much. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=213.06s)]
*  But then he turned serious and switched to Italian. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=217.82s)]
*  Leo called on journalists to strive for communication that, quote, does not seek consensus at all [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=220.94s)]
*  costs and never separates the search for truth from the love with which the truth is sought. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=226.26s)]
*  And he reiterated the Catholic Church's solidarity with journalists who are imprisoned for seeking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=232.3s)]
*  and reporting the truth, especially in war-torn regions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=237.34s)]
*  Jason DeRose, NPR News, Rome. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=241.26s)]
*  President Trump says he'll sign an executive order today to reduce drug prices. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=245.18s)]
*  NPR's Luke Garrett reports. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=249.22s)]
*  President Trump is promising to reduce drug prices by 30 to 80 percent, quote, almost [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  immediately. Posting on social media, Trump says his executive order will lower pharmaceutical [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=255.94s)]
*  costs to, quote, the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price, end quote. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=260.54s)]
*  He's calling it a most favored nation policy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=265.58s)]
*  In 2020, Trump signed an executive order of the same name and general principle, but it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=268.14s)]
*  was blocked by the courts and then killed by President Joe Biden a year later. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=273.18s)]
*  The driving idea is that Medicare would refuse to pay more for certain drugs than the lowest [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=277.26s)]
*  price paid by other developed nations. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=281.94s)]
*  Drug companies criticized the idea as unworkable and irresponsible in 2020. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=284.53999999999996s)]
*  It's unclear what payments or drugs this new order would apply to. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  Luke Garrett, NPR News, Washington. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=293.06s)]
*  A militant Kurdish group says it's laying down its arms and will disband. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  The Kurdistan Workers' Party, better known as the PKK, announced today it will disband. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=300.58s)]
*  The Kurdistan Workers' Party is going to end its armed struggle with Turkey that was aimed at [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=305.46s)]
*  carving out a separate homeland for Kurds. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  That armed conflict has lasted for more than 40 years. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=312.26s)]
*  Jury selection for the federal sex trafficking trial of Sean Combs is expected to wrap up today [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=316.5s)]
*  in New York City, and Piers Isabella Gomez-Sarmiento reports opening statements are then [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=321.85999999999996s)]
*  scheduled to begin immediately. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  Jury selection has stretched out for a week. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=329.21999999999997s)]
*  Three days, Judge Arun Subramanian questioned New Yorkers on their knowledge of the allegations against the powerful music producer and entrepreneur [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=332.26s)]
*  and their ability to remain impartial. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  After dozens of jurors were selected to move forward, the final steps of the process were delayed twice. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=341.94s)]
*  There were fears jurors would back out from serving once selected. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=347.38s)]
*  Today, the defense and prosecution will narrow that group down to the 12 who will serve plus six alternates. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=350.97999999999996s)]
*  Then opening statements will begin. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=356.58s)]
*  Prosecutors allege that Sean Diddy Combs used his businesses to organize and conceal sex crimes for over a decade. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  Isabella Gomez-Sarmiento and PR News. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=366.18s)]
*  For many, the perennial sound of spring or summer is on its way back. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=369.38s)]
*  That is the sound of cicadas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=373.62s)]
*  A rare brood of cicadas that comes like clockwork every 17 years has begun to emerge in the eastern half of the U.S. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=375.78s)]
*  And Piers Amy Held explains. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=383.3s)]
*  For the first time since 2008, brood 14 is back. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=385.38s)]
*  Some have been sighted in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Ohio. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=389.14s)]
*  They're expected to emerge from Georgia to Massachusetts. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=392.5s)]
*  Considered the second biggest of the dozen or so known periodical broods, they develop underground, then come out by the billions and buzz. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=395.86s)]
*  That's on top of annual cicadas that emerge every year. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=405.38s)]
*  Experts say far from being bugged by them, the insects give big benefits, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=408.66s)]
*  improving water filtration, providing birds an important food source, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=413.06s)]
*  and with their above ground stay typically lasting just a few weeks, their decomposing bodies provide nutrition to the soil. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=416.98s)]
*  But not until they've ensured the next generation to be heard from in 2042. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8imittqgjRs&t=424.26s)]
