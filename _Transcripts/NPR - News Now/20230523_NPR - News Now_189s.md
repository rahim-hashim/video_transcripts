# Biden, McCarthy Say Monday's Debt Limit Talks Were Productive | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E)
*  President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met again yesterday to talk about the nation's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=0.0s)]
*  debt ceiling. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=4.68s)]
*  And fighting continues in the Russian region of Belgrade near the border with Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=5.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=10.5s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=11.5s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=12.88s)]
*  President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy say they're optimistic an agreement will be [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=15.44s)]
*  reached to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=19.12s)]
*  NPO's Franco Ordoñez reports Biden and McCarthy met again yesterday at the White House. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=21.04s)]
*  President Biden said at the start of the meeting that it's time for both sides to find [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=26.28s)]
*  compromise. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=29.6s)]
*  We have to be in a position where we can sell it to our constituencies. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=30.6s)]
*  We're pretty well divided in the House, almost down the middle. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=34.88s)]
*  And it's not any different in the Senate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  So we've got to get something to sell to both sides. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=40.04s)]
*  After the meeting ended a little more than an hour later, McCarthy called it the best [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=43.0s)]
*  they've had on the issue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=47.16s)]
*  I believe we can still get there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=48.8s)]
*  I believe we can get it done. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  It's still early to tell if this indicates a breakthrough. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=53.28s)]
*  The leaders told staff to continue talking to find common ground. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  And McCarthy says he thinks he and Biden will talk every day now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  Franco Ordoñez, NPR News, the White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=64.11999999999999s)]
*  Plans are underway to break ground on a new school in Uvalde, Texas this summer. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=67.6s)]
*  Texas Public Radio's Camille Phillips reports the new school will replace Robb Elementary, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=71.36s)]
*  where 19 children and two teachers were killed one year ago. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=76.44s)]
*  Uvalde's new school will be in a new location. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=80.16s)]
*  Lalo Diaz is co-chair of the committee helping architects design the school. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=83.92s)]
*  He says the community needs a fresh start and a place that hasn't seen violence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=89.08s)]
*  In Hispanic culture and in most cases probably in culture, most of the families will say [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=94.0s)]
*  that how can we build something there when the devil's there? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=98.64s)]
*  The new school is designed around an interior courtyard so that students will have a protected [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=101.84s)]
*  outdoor space. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=107.24s)]
*  At the center, a steel tree with 21 branches will honor the memory of Robb's victims. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=108.78s)]
*  Colorful elements that represent Uvalde, like honeybees and monarch butterflies, are also [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=115.1s)]
*  included in the design. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=121.02s)]
*  I'm Camille Phillips in San Antonio. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  Federal authorities have arrested the driver of a box truck that crashed into the barriers [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=125.66s)]
*  near the White House last night. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=129.78s)]
*  The Secret Service says it appears the driver did it intentionally. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=131.66s)]
*  Officials say he is facing several charges. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  Fighting continues in the Russian region of Belgrade near the border with Ukraine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=138.78s)]
*  Russia is blaming Ukrainian saboteurs, but two Russian paramilitary groups have claimed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=143.38s)]
*  responsibility. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=149.14s)]
*  They say they're attempting to overthrow the Russian regime in Moscow. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=150.42s)]
*  Ukraine's former infrastructure minister, Volodymyr Omelyan, says that after Russia [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=154.42s)]
*  invaded last year, he predicted Russia would see attacks on its own territory. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=159.14s)]
*  There is no doubt about that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=163.9s)]
*  And it's not only territory of Ukraine which will suffer. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=165.82s)]
*  It will be also territory of Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  But in our attention as Ukrainian armed forces, we are not going to cross the border. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=172.38s)]
*  We just want to restore our territory in the borders of 1991 as it used to be. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=179.18s)]
*  He spoke to the BBC. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=184.26s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h9a2Gl3z4E&t=186.06s)]
