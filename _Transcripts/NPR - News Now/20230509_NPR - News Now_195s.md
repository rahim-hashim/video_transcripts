# Biden Pushes New Gun Restrictions After Texas Mall Shooting | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8)
*  After another mass shooting over the weekend, President Biden is again working to rally support for new gun restrictions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=0.0s)]
*  And jury deliberations begin today in a civil case against former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=11.4s)]
*  Texas authorities are gathering more information about the gunman in last weekend's mass shooting in Allen near Dallas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=16.2s)]
*  Eight people were killed and at least seven others were injured. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=22.7s)]
*  Investigators say the gunman, who was shot and killed at the scene, appears to have held far-right beliefs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=26.099999999999998s)]
*  He was also wearing a patch with initials that apparently stand for right-wing death squad. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=31.9s)]
*  Following the Texas mass shooting, NPR's Giles Snyder reports President Biden is seeking to rally support for new gun restrictions. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=37.9s)]
*  At a Monday night reception at the White House, President Biden addressed gun safety, again calling for a new ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  He also wants to end immunity for gun manufacturers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=55.2s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is planning to convene a special Democratic caucus meeting on gun safety, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=58.1s)]
*  but Democrats have been unable to skeer enough support to overcome Republican opposition. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=64.2s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder reporting. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=68.5s)]
*  Officials in Brownsville, Texas have filed manslaughter charges against a man who drove into a group of people on Sunday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=70.8s)]
*  He killed eight migrants. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=78.10000000000001s)]
*  A jury in New York is about to start deliberating the civil case of sexual battery and defamation against former President Donald Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=80.6s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Bernstein reports the case is being brought by writer E. Gene Carroll. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=88.7s)]
*  In closing arguments Monday, Carroll's attorney said finding Donald Trump not liable would mean believing 11 witnesses lied on the stand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=94.2s)]
*  And that Donald Trump lied, too, when he said in the Access Hollywood tape he liked to grab women by the genitals [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=103.1s)]
*  because when you're a star they let you do it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=108.6s)]
*  But Trump's lawyers say the assault never happened and was concocted by Carroll and others to hurt Trump politically. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  After instructions this morning, the jury will decide based on the preponderance of the evidence if Trump is liable. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  If so, damages could run well into the millions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=124.8s)]
*  Andrea Bernstein, NPR News, New York. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli military says it killed three Palestinian militant commanders in Gaza today, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  leading both Israelis and Palestinians to brace for an outburst of violence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=135.9s)]
*  Aaron Boxerman reports from Jerusalem that Palestinian health officials say at least 13 Palestinians were killed in the strikes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=140.9s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets bombarded the blockaded Gaza Strip before dawn on Tuesday, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  killing three senior members of Islamic Jihad, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=153.1s)]
*  It says the victims include the commander's wives and some of their children. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=158.4s)]
*  Israel and Gaza militants have frequently clashed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=162.3s)]
*  Most recently last week, after an Islamic Jihad member died following a three-month hunger strike in an Israeli jail. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=165.0s)]
*  This time, both sides appear to expect a wider escalation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=171.7s)]
*  Gaza authorities shuttered schools and Israel closed checkpoints and roads leading to the enclave. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=175.3s)]
*  An Israeli military spokesperson said Israel had achieved its goals for now, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=181.2s)]
*  but that it was unclear how the situation would develop. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=185.3s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Aaron Boxerman in Jerusalem. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9uD_m0v0R8&t=188.1s)]
