*  A three-year-old American girl whose parents were killed in the attack on Israel last month [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=0.0s)]
*  is among the hostages being held in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=5.28s)]
*  And OpenAI is reinstating Sam Altman as the company's CEO. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=7.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=12.52s)]
*  I'm Kristen Wright with NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=13.52s)]
*  A three-year-old American girl is among the hostages being held by Hamas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=16.6s)]
*  Her parents were killed by the militants. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=21.48s)]
*  The girl could be released in a new agreement between Israel and Hamas to pause the fighting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=23.72s)]
*  and let 50 hostages go. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=28.88s)]
*  Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S. brokered the deal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=30.96s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordonez reports on President Biden's reaction. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=34.12s)]

*  Qatar and Egypt for their assistance. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=43.36s)]
*  And I'll just note, it was actually the same channel that they created that led to the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=45.879999999999995s)]

*  that the channel worked, but also that the Qataris could deliver. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=60.08s)]

*  The company announced its former CEO, Sam Altman, is returning. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=85.88s)]
*  He was fired by the board of directors late last week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=90.56s)]

*  load of environmental costs, industrial pollution, waste dumping and now climate change. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltb6K5lt6g4&t=140.35999999999999s)]
