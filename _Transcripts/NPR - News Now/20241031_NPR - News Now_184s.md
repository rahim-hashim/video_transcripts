# Trump Climbs Into A Garbage Truck In Wisconsin | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY)
*  Good morning. Today is Thursday, October 31st. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is doubling down on references to quote garbage. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=7.0s)]
*  This started last weekend when a comedian at a Trump rally said that Puerto Rico was quote a floating island of garbage. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Then President Biden seemed to refer to Trump supporters as garbage. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=18.2s)]
*  The White House says Biden was only referring to the comedian. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=22.2s)]
*  But Trump showed up at an event in Green Bay, Wisconsin yesterday in a white garbage truck with his name emblazoned on the side. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=25.3s)]
*  He lambasted Biden. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=33.0s)]
*  My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=34.8s)]
*  You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=38.2s)]
*  It's true. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=42.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, Vice President Harris campaigned yesterday in Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=43.3s)]
*  She is urging supporters to make sure they get to the polls. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=48.0s)]
*  So I'm visiting with you this afternoon because we need you to vote, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=51.6s)]
*  We need you to vote. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=56.7s)]
*  Harris flies to Arizona today for a rally and a concert in Phoenix. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=58.2s)]
*  She'll also go to Nevada. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=62.1s)]
*  Former President Trump will campaign briefly in Albuquerque, New Mexico today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  Then he will also go to Nevada and to Arizona. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=68.1s)]
*  Trump continues to spread baseless claims of large scale election cheating in the swing state of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=71.6s)]
*  As NPR's Hansi Le Wang reports, many election observers say the Trump campaign is laying the groundwork to question Pennsylvania's election results. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=79.1s)]
*  There's no evidence of large scale levels of cheating in the swing state of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=88.3s)]
*  There is an investigation into potentially fraudulent voter registration forms in two counties west of Philadelphia. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=92.9s)]
*  Last week in Lancaster County, officials said they're looking into approximately 2500 applications. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=99.1s)]
*  And in York County, officials say they're looking into thousands. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=104.3s)]
*  All were dropped off around Pennsylvania's deadline last week for registering to vote in this fall's election. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  So far, officials have not named the sources of these forms. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=112.1s)]
*  Lancaster County election officials stress that their ability to flag this potential fraud shows that the quote systems worked. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=115.1s)]
*  Local law enforcement say they're also part of the investigations. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=122.1s)]
*  Hansi Le Wang, NPR News. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=124.9s)]
*  In Kentucky, jury deliberations continue today in the federal retrial of a former Louisville police detective. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=126.4s)]
*  Brett Hankison is charged with violating the rights of Breonna Taylor and her neighbors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=133.6s)]
*  Louisville Public Media's Giselle Rodin has more. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=139.0s)]
*  Hankison was one of the officers that fired during the fatal raid at Taylor's home on March 13th, 2020. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=142.5s)]
*  He fired several shots through a covered window and sliding glass door outside Taylor's apartment. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=148.6s)]
*  Defense attorneys Wednesday argued Hankison couldn't have violated Taylor's civil rights. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=154.0s)]
*  They claim she was already dead when Hankison fired several shots into her apartment. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=158.9s)]
*  However, federal prosecutors argue Taylor was alive when Hankison first fired into the home. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=163.5s)]
*  Several police officers who were there that night testify that Hankison went against police protocol by firing without being able to see who he was shooting at. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=169.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Giselle Rodin in Louisville. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkooecQDUY&t=177.5s)]
