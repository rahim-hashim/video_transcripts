# Trump Suggests Biden Delayed Sharing His Cancer Diagnosis | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ)
*  President Trump has suggested without evidence that former President Joe Biden delayed sharing his cancer diagnosis [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And a congresswoman has been charged with assaulting ICE agents at a detention facility in New Jersey [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=6.96s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=12.92s)]
*  President Trump has suggested without evidence former President Joe Biden delayed sharing his diagnosis of prostate cancer [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=18.0s)]
*  NPR's Mara Eliason reports [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=24.16s)]
*  Trump initially said he thought Biden's new health challenge was quote very sad [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=26.16s)]
*  But then he seemed to accuse Biden of hiding the information about his cancer [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=30.16s)]
*  I'm surprised that it wasn't, you know, the public wasn't notified a long time ago [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=34.16s)]
*  Because to get to stage nine, that's a long time [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=40.16s)]
*  Biden's cancer is stage four, not stage nine [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=42.16s)]
*  Trump may have been confusing that with Biden's Gleason score of nine [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=45.16s)]
*  A Gleason score measures the aggressiveness of cancer cells [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=49.16s)]
*  The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force does not recommend that men over the age of 70 get routine prostate specific antigen screening [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=53.16s)]
*  Because the potential harms outweigh the benefits [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=61.16s)]
*  Trump's latest comments were in line with his repeated attacks on Biden's physical and mental health [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=64.16s)]
*  Mara Eliason, NPR News [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=70.16s)]

*  NPR's Polina Litvinova reports Zelensky spoke after talking with President Trump yesterday [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=79.16s)]
*  Zelensky said he spoke with President Trump twice [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=85.16s)]
*  Before and after Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=88.16s)]
*  The Ukrainian president said his country is willing for peace, but won't agree on territorial concessions [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=92.16s)]
*  No one will withdraw our troops from our territories, he said [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=104.16s)]
*  There will be no ultimatums and no one will surrender their land, their territory, their people, their homes [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=107.16s)]
*  Zelensky also asked Trump about sanctions if Russia doesn't agree to end the war [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=113.16s)]
*  Adding that American banking and energy sanctions would cause significant economic challenges for Russia [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=119.16s)]
*  Polina Litvinova, NPR News, Kyiv [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=125.16s)]
*  President Trump is on Capitol Hill this hour meeting with House Republicans [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=128.16s)]
*  He's urging them to vote for a GOP budget bill that includes spending for his domestic priorities [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=132.16s)]
*  That includes extending tax cuts that will expire this year [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=137.16s)]

*  They're worried about the debt [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=144.16s)]

*  House Speaker Mike Johnson is confident he will gain enough GOP support for the bill [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=155.16s)]
*  We're almost there and I'm very optimistic we will find the right equilibrium point to get this bill delivered [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=160.16s)]
*  He can only afford to lose a couple of Republican votes, otherwise the bill will fail [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=165.16s)]
*  All Democrats are in opposition [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=170.16s)]
*  The acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey says she is filing federal assault charges against a U.S. Congresswoman from that state [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=172.16s)]

*  The charge stems from a clash with ICE agents outside a migrant detention facility in Newark earlier this month [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=202.16s)]

*  U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins has signed a waiver that she says will remove soda and energy drinks from the list of things people can buy with their SNAP benefits in certain states [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU9lkBpGvQ&t=229.16s)]
