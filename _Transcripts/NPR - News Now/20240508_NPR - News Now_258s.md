*  recovered the body of the sixth and final victim of the Baltimore Bridge collapse last March. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJSSW5VrQ&t=5.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kori Fah Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJSSW5VrQ&t=10.72s)]
*  The Biden administration has paused a shipment of more than 3,000 bombs to Israel. NPR's Franco [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJSSW5VrQ&t=14.96s)]
*  Ordonez reports U.S. officials are concerned the bombs could be used in the southern Gaza city of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJSSW5VrQ&t=20.72s)]

*  including 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. The officials said they were [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJSSW5VrQ&t=53.2s)]

*  outstanding legal issues first. Trump's other federal criminal case for allegedly trying to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJSSW5VrQ&t=111.44s)]
*  overturn the 2020 election has also been postponed, as the Supreme Court considers Trump's immunity [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJSSW5VrQ&t=116.72s)]
