# Trump Announces New Tariffs For Canada, China, Mexico | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE)
*  President-elect Donald Trump says he plans to impose significant new tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico when he takes office in January. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=0.0s)]
*  And officials from both Lebanon and Israel say they are close to a new ceasefire deal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=8.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=12.0s)]
*  Asian markets are mostly down today. That's after President-elect Donald Trump announced he will impose significant new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China once he takes office in January. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=16.0s)]
*  NPR's Rebecca Rossman reports from Tokyo. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=27.0s)]
*  Worries about a potential trade war shook overseas markets after Trump vowed in a social media post to follow through on a campaign promise to impose tariffs on several countries. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=30.0s)]
*  Canada and Mexico would be charged a 25 percent tariff on all products coming into the United States while China would be levied with an extra 10 percent tax. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=41.0s)]
*  He said this was in response to illegal immigration and drug trafficking. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=51.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Wall Street saw gains yesterday with the S&P 500 up and the Dow hitting a new record high. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=56.0s)]
*  Stocks rose on expectations of lower interest rates and news that Trump wants hedge fund manager Scott Besant as his Treasury Secretary. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=63.0s)]
*  Rebecca Rossman, NPR News, Tokyo. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=70.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump has confirmed he will declare a national state of emergency and use the U.S. military in some form to launch his mass deportation of undocumented migrants. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=73.0s)]
*  The Texas newsroom's Stella Chavez reports Republican state officials in Texas say they are prepared to help Trump carry out his promise. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=83.0s)]
*  Texas has spent the past few years strengthening its border security and enforcement. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=91.0s)]
*  It's installed razor wire and buoys to deter crossings. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=96.0s)]
*  It's bussed migrants to blue states. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=99.0s)]
*  And recently it offered 1,400 acres of land to Trump for detention facilities. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=102.0s)]
*  Joshua Trevino with the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation expects the state and new administration to work together. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=107.0s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of deportations. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=115.0s)]
*  There's going to be a greater focus on border security. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=118.0s)]
*  But I think how that's done, we don't know what that looks like yet. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=120.0s)]
*  Immigrant rights and labor groups in Texas say they're worried about Trump's mass deportation plans. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=122.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Stella Chavez. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=128.0s)]
*  A federal judge has dismissed the federal election interference case against President-elect Trump. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=131.0s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports the move came after a request from special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=137.0s)]
*  Judge Tonya Chutkin's decision to dismiss the election interference case against Trump without prejudice comes just hours after Smith submitted his request with the court. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=142.0s)]
*  In that filing, Smith said the government is confident in the strength and merit of the case against Trump, but that department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=151.0s)]
*  In a separate filing, Smith is also moving to drop the other case he brought against Trump for hoarding classified documents. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=160.0s)]
*  But prosecutors will continue the prosecution of Trump's two co-defendants in that case. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=166.0s)]
*  Smith had been known to be winding down the cases following Trump's election win. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=171.0s)]
*  Smith himself is expected to leave his post before Trump takes office. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=175.0s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=180.0s)]
*  Israeli warplanes continue to strike Hezbollah targets in Beirut. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=182.0s)]
*  Even his officials from Lebanon and Israel say they are close to a ceasefire agreement. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=186.0s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from Beirut. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=191.0s)]
*  Both countries' cabinets are meeting today and tomorrow to discuss details. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=193.0s)]
*  Lebanese lawmaker Simon Abiramia tells NPR his government has approved what he says would be an initial two-month ceasefire. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=201.0s)]
*  It calls for Israeli troops to withdraw from Lebanon and for Hezbollah to pull its fighters and weapons north of the Litani River, about 20 miles from the Israeli border. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=209.0s)]
*  The Lebanese army would move in alongside United Nations peacekeepers. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=218.0s)]
*  An international committee would also be set up to monitor implementation of the ceasefire. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=223.0s)]
*  Israel had asked for the right to preemptively strike Hezbollah if it suspects militants of violating this agreement. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=228.0s)]
*  But Abiramia says that provision is not part of the deal he's seen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=235.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer and NPR News, Beirut. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=239.0s)]
*  The Biden administration is proposing that Medicare and Medicaid cover expensive weight loss medications for beneficiaries. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=241.0s)]
*  These include drugs like Ozempic and Wigovie. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=250.0s)]
*  The White House says the medications could help millions of Americans with obesity. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=253.0s)]
*  Automaker General Motors says it has reached a deal to enter one of the world's most prestigious auto racing series, Formula One. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=258.0s)]
*  This comes after months of contentious talks and a Justice Department investigation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=266.0s)]
*  From member station WDET, Quinn Klinefelter has more. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=271.0s)]
*  Formula One's ownership initially rejected a joint bid by GM's Cadillac brand and legendary racer Michael Andretti, arguing the proposed team would not bring enough value to the globe-spanning series. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=275.0s)]
*  There was also a clash of personalities between Andretti and the head of Liberty Media, Formula One's commercial rights holder. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=286.0s)]
*  The logjam seemed to break after both Andretti and Liberty Media's boss announced they would step down from leading their organizations. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=292.0s)]
*  Now the renamed Cadillac F1 team is set to join the racing series in 2026. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=299.0s)]
*  The deal also likely brings to a close a Justice Department investigation into whether Formula One's decision to block Andretti violated U.S. antitrust laws. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=305.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Quinn Klinefelter in Detroit. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=314.0s)]
*  First Lady Jill Biden has received the White House Christmas tree. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=317.0s)]
*  It will be decorated and set up in the White House Blue Room for the holidays. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=321.0s)]
*  The Fraser fir tree comes from a North Carolina farm that was devastated by Hurricane Helene earlier this year. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=325.0s)]
*  That farm lost thousands of other trees in the storm. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=332.0s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman, NPR News. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVXPXrXqyE&t=335.0s)]
