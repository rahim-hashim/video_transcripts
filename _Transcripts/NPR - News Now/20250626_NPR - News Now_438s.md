# Hegseth Blasts Coverage Of 'Historically Successful' Iran Strikes | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s)
*  Good morning. Today is Thursday, June 26th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Koriva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=3.0s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities caused massive damage. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=7.0s)]
*  NPR's Quill Lawrence reports he attacked the press for suggesting otherwise. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=13.0s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense repeatedly praised President Trump's leadership in deciding to attack Iran's nuclear sites last weekend. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=17.0s)]
*  He said... [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=23.0s)]
*  ...up flight by U.S. servicemen and women. But he said a full assessment of the strike was still pending. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=53.0s)]
*  Quill Lawrence, NPR News. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=58.0s)]
*  Amid the debate in the U.S. about the state of Iran's nuclear facilities, Israel's nuclear agency is adding its own assessment. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=60.0s)]
*  Israel says it set Iran's nuclear program back. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=67.0s)]
*  NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=71.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released an assessment on behalf of Israel's Atomic Energy Commission. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=74.0s)]
*  It assesses that U.S. and Israeli strikes set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=80.0s)]
*  It also said the U.S. strike on Iran's most fortified nuclear enrichment site, Fordow, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=87.0s)]
*  destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=92.0s)]
*  Israel's Atomic Energy Commission did not say how it knows that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=98.0s)]
*  President Trump suggested in remarks to reporters that Israel had agents at the Fordow facility. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=102.0s)]
*  He said, quote, they have guys that go in there after the hit and they said it was total obliteration. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=107.0s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=112.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is suing all the federal judges in Maryland. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=115.0s)]
*  The administration is citing a federal court order that blocks the immediate removal of detained migrants. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=119.0s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=124.0s)]
*  The Trump administration filed the lawsuit against 15 federal judges in the District of Maryland. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=126.0s)]
*  The administration is challenging a standing rule put in place by the district's chief judge [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=131.0s)]
*  that automatically blocks on a limited temporary basis the government from deporting migrants in Maryland [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=135.0s)]
*  who file suit challenging their detention. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=141.0s)]
*  The administration says the rule impedes the power of the White House to enforce immigration laws [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=143.0s)]
*  and is an unlawful attempt to restrain the executive branch. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=148.0s)]
*  The unusual suit was filed in the court the administration is suing, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=151.0s)]
*  so the Justice Department is requesting that the case be presided over by a federal judge from another district. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=155.0s)]
*  The court in Maryland declined to comment. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=161.0s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=163.0s)]
*  The Vaccine Advisory Committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=165.0s)]
*  will reexamine the number of vaccines that kids get. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=170.0s)]
*  NPR's Ping Huang has more. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=173.0s)]
*  The CDC's Influential Vaccine Advisory Committee met with all new members and a new tone was immediately evident. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=176.0s)]
*  Martin Kuhldorf, a biostatistician and the chair of the group, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=182.0s)]
*  says they're considering major changes to the vaccine schedule for kids. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=185.0s)]
*  The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceed what children in most other developed nations receive. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=189.0s)]
*  The committee's recommendations are critical in guiding state and local vaccine policies along with what insurers cover. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=197.0s)]
*  Ping Huang, NPR News, Atlanta. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=203.0s)]
*  The migrant Kilmer Abrego Garcia will remain jailed in Nashville, Tennessee. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=206.0s)]
*  A federal judge had ordered his release on bail. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=211.0s)]
*  He's facing allegations of human smuggling. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=214.0s)]
*  His lawyers are now arguing against prosecutors' demands that Abrego Garcia be deported again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=217.0s)]
*  Protesters gathered yesterday outside the courthouse in Nashville. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=223.0s)]
*  When his case began, Abrego Garcia had been wrongly deported to El Salvador earlier this year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=231.0s)]
*  He was quietly returned to the U.S. but jailed on the smuggling charges that he denies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=237.0s)]
*  His wife, Jennifer Vasquez-Sura, spoke yesterday. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=243.0s)]
*  This fight has been the hardest thing in my life. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=246.0s)]
*  Abrego Garcia will remain jailed for the present. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=249.0s)]
*  Democratic Socialist Zoran Mamdani is poised to become the Democratic Party's nominee for mayor of New York City. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=253.0s)]
*  NPR's Stephen Fowler has more on what that primary outcome may mean for the National Party. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=260.0s)]
*  At a time when the Democratic brand is facing deep unpopularity with voters, Mamdani's success is notable. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=266.0s)]
*  Tom Jensen of Democratic-aligned firm Public Policy Polling said a big part of that came from increased turnout and support from voters under 45. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=272.0s)]
*  What we really just found the key was, was he was engaging young people in a level that's extremely unusual for something like a primary election for mayor. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=280.0s)]
*  After losing the White House, the Senate and failing to retake the House, the Democrats are searching for good signs anywhere they can. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=290.0s)]
*  Stephen Fowler, NPR News. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=296.0s)]
*  Today marks 10 years since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S. with its Obergefell decision. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=299.0s)]
*  NPR's Jason DeRose reports that support for same-sex marriage among people of faith has increased over time. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=306.0s)]
*  Pew Research finds support for same-sex marriage has jumped over the last decade from 46 to 58 percent among all religiously affiliated U.S. adults. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=313.0s)]
*  But evangelical Christians remain strongly opposed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=322.0s)]
*  The Southern Baptist Convention recently passed a resolution calling for the overturning of Obergefell. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=325.0s)]
*  The church's Brent Leatherwood says they're inspired by what happened with abortion rights. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=331.0s)]
*  As you saw with the overturn of Roe, that took 50 years. So we would have to be patient. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=335.0s)]
*  Even if Obergefell were overturned, the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires states with bans to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=342.0s)]
*  Jason DeRose, NPR News. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=351.0s)]
*  In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials say three Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire after Israeli settlers attacked a Palestinian village. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=354.0s)]
*  Israel made arrests, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=364.0s)]
*  The Israeli army says dozens of Israelis set fire to property in the Palestinian village of Kuffar Malik. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=368.0s)]
*  The village council released this video. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=374.0s)]
*  A car is engulfed in flames as a man tries to put out the blaze with a pot of water. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=377.0s)]
*  The Israeli army says clashes then broke out, with Palestinians opening fire and hurling rocks and soldiers shot at them resulting in the killings. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=382.0s)]
*  In a rare move, Israeli authorities said they arrested five Israelis at the scene. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=390.0s)]
*  Another settler arson attack was documented near another West Bank village, Taibbi. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=395.0s)]
*  For years, the U.S. and European countries have accused Israel of tolerating settler violence against Palestinians. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=400.0s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=406.0s)]
*  A loaded cargo ship that was on fire burning off the Pacific coast of Alaska sank on Monday. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=409.0s)]
*  It had been burning for three weeks. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=414.0s)]
*  The crew escaped safely, but the ship was carrying thousands of electric vehicles, and it had some 1,800 metric tons of fuel oil. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=416.0s)]
*  Emergency responders say they've not yet seen evidence of pollution. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=424.0s)]
*  Coast Guard officials say it is too early to tell if the EV's lithium batteries triggered the fire. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=428.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpaMAmABS2s&t=434.0s)]
