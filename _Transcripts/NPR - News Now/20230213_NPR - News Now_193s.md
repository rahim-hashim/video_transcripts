# Chiefs Win Super Bowl LVII, U.S. Downs 3 UFOs In 3 Days | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM)
*  The U.S. military has now shot down three objects in North American airspace in as many [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=0.0s)]
*  days. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=5.58s)]
*  And last night, Patrick Mahomes led Kansas City to its second Super Bowl victory in four [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=6.58s)]
*  years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=11.18s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=12.18s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=13.18s)]
*  The U.S. Air Force has now shot down three unidentified objects in three days. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=16.34s)]
*  That's in addition to the Chinese spy balloon brought down off South Carolina earlier this [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=20.94s)]
*  month. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=25.34s)]
*  The latest mystery object was downed yesterday in Lake Huron, just off Michigan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=26.34s)]
*  From Michigan radio, Brett Dahlberg reports radar is involved. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=30.98s)]
*  Military radar is often calibrated to pick up pretty big, fast-moving objects like fighter [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=35.06s)]
*  jets or missiles. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=40.1s)]
*  It's not really looking for small objects moving with the wind. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=41.7s)]
*  But General Glenn Van Hurk says since the recent discovery of a suspected Chinese spy [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=45.46s)]
*  balloon in U.S. skies, the Pentagon is making some changes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=49.86s)]
*  Van Hurk is commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=54.14s)]
*  With some adjustments, we've been able to get a better categorization of radar tracks [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=63.58s)]
*  Van Hurk says that could be one of the reasons for increased detections of the small, slow [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=64.58s)]
*  objects, though the Pentagon says it's still trying to figure out exactly what they are. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=68.66s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Brett Dahlberg in Grand Rapids. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=73.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. is rejecting China's claims that American balloons have entered [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  Chinese airspace at least 10 times. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says that's not true. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=83.86s)]
*  The death toll from the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria has now exceeded 35,000 people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=88.18s)]
*  Rescuers say that after a week, it's increasingly unlikely they'll find many more survivors [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=93.94s)]
*  under the rubble. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=98.5s)]
*  In Israel, thousands of people are gathering in Jerusalem to protest the government's controversial [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=100.16s)]
*  plan to weaken the powers of the judiciary. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=104.66s)]
*  As NPR's Daniel Estrin reports, Israel's right-wing coalition has held initial votes [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=108.02s)]
*  on the proposal. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=113.14s)]
*  Israeli media say police estimate at least 10,000 Israelis turned out near parliament. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=114.66s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition has now advanced some of its proposed legislation [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=119.3s)]
*  with an initial vote in a parliamentary committee. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=124.3s)]
*  The government wants the power to choose judges and to limit the Supreme Court's judicial [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=127.28s)]
*  review. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=132.1s)]
*  The chief justice of the Supreme Court says that would endanger democracy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=133.1s)]
*  President Isaac Herzog called on Netanyahu's coalition to delay the legislation, but it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=137.24s)]
*  still went ahead with the initial vote. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=141.86s)]
*  Even President Biden weighed in, telling the New York Times he urges consensus for any [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=144.34s)]
*  major change in Israel. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=148.82s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=150.66s)]
*  The Kansas City Chiefs have now won the Super Bowl twice in the last four years, and both [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=152.58s)]
*  of those times the Super Bowl's most valuable player was Kansas City quarterback Patrick [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=157.28s)]
*  Mahomes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=161.94s)]
*  Greg Eklund has more from Glendale, Arizona. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=162.94s)]
*  Patrick Mahomes threw for 182 yards and connected for three touchdown passes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=165.94s)]
*  But while likely still feeling the effects of a high ankle sprain he re-injured in the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=171.44s)]
*  first half, he ran for 26 yards, his longest run of the night, in the final minutes to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=176.24s)]
*  set up the game-winning field goal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=182.2s)]
*  The Chiefs won 38 to 35. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2HwzsSQAZM&t=184.7s)]
