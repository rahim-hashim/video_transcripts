# Trump Says He Supports Leaving Abortion To The States | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c)
*  Former President Donald Trump says he agrees with the Supreme Court in leaving abortion rights up to the states to decide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=0.0s)]
*  And millions of Americans are expected to hit the roads today to get a glimpse of today's total solar eclipse. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=6.24s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=12.24s)]
*  Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has released a statement this morning on his view of abortion rights. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=16.56s)]
*  He says he is supporting the current view spelled out by the U.S. Supreme Court that abortion rights are a matter to be left up to the states. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=22.92s)]
*  Many states will be different. Many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others, and that's what they will be. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=30.32s)]
*  At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people. You must follow your heart or, in many cases, your religion or your faith. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump says he supports exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest or the life of the mother. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=48.48s)]
*  President Biden is going to Wisconsin today where he will talk about helping people reduce their student loan debt. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=54.92s)]
*  The White House has unveiled new plans to help borrowers cut interest payments millions of people owe more now than when they first borrowed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=61.12s)]
*  One plan offers interest relief of up to $20,000, regardless of income level. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=69.08s)]
*  Congress returns this week after an extended recess with plans to hold the Senate impeachment trial for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=75.0s)]
*  MPR's Claudia Grisales reports it's part of a busy to-do list that includes lawmaker debate over military aid to Israel, Ukraine and more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  In February, Congress put a series of major issues on the back burner that will take center stage this week. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=93.6s)]
*  The plans were put on hold until lawmakers finally passed a federal budget for this year's fiscal year. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=100.64s)]
*  Now, the Democratic-led Senate plans to start its trial of Secretary Mayorkas after he was impeached by the Republican-led House. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=106.52s)]
*  And while that's expected to be a short-lived effort, Congress will see plenty of debate on whether to provide aid to Israel, Ukraine and other allies. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=115.04s)]
*  Many Democrats are raising new concerns on whether any military aid to Israel should be conditions-based. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=124.12s)]
*  Claudia Grisales, NPR News. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  It is Eclipse Day. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  More than 30 million people who live in the path of totality are being joined by millions of travelers to see the celestial event. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=134.8s)]
*  NPR's Scott Newman has more. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  The path of the eclipse traces a shallow arc across the Hoosier state from Vincennes to Union City. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=144.72s)]
*  Jason Elijah from Fort Wayne is planning to spend the day in northwestern Ohio with his partner, but just outside the path of totality. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=151.6s)]
*  He's concerned about the crowds. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=161.48s)]
*  Usually when events like this happen, usually crazy stuff happens. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  And I just think it's probably going to be too much for these smaller cities. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=166.56s)]
*  To say the total solar eclipse is a once-in-a-lifetime event in Indiana would be an understatement. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=169.32s)]
*  Some parts of the state that will experience totality haven't witnessed such an event since Ulysses S. Grant was president. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=175.16s)]
*  For others, it's been more than a thousand years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPnkkY-h6c&t=182.35999999999999s)]
