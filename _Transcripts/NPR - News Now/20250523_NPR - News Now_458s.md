# Trump Administration Tells Harvard To Stop Enrolling International Students | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, May 23rd. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security says it's revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=6.72s)]
*  From member station GBH in Boston, Kirk Carapazza reports it's a significant escalation in the White House's feud with the university. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=12.32s)]
*  DHS has told Harvard's president the university can't enroll foreign students because it failed to provide student disciplinary records. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=20.0s)]
*  It's telling current students to transfer out or they'll lose their visa status. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=27.84s)]
*  Harvard calls the move unlawful, saying the school remains committed to hosting global students and scholars. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=32.4s)]
*  Historian Allison Frank Johnson says the action threatens their academic mission. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  We're talking here about students who've worked their whole lives to be able to attend a college of this caliber and now they don't know if they can continue their educations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=42.96s)]
*  We're also talking about graduate students who are working in labs to cure cancer. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=51.6s)]
*  Harvard already has a pending lawsuit against the administration accusing it of government overreach. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=56.88s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Kirk Carapazza in Boston. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=62.0s)]
*  President Trump is making a new tariff threat. Writing online this morning, Trump warned big tech company Apple he will impose at least a 25% tariff on all iPhones sold in the U.S. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  That is unless the iPhones are manufactured and built in the U.S. and quote, not in India or any place else. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=76.72s)]
*  Trump is making an additional tariff threat. Again, writing online, Trump says he'll impose a 50% tariff on the European Union. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=83.92s)]
*  He claims the U.S. has a trade deficit with the EU of hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  He says unless that changes, the tariff will take effect June 1st. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=97.2s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has given President Trump the power to fire key federal agency leaders. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=101.68s)]
*  NPR's Nina Totenberg reports the Supreme Court vote was 6 to 3, with the court's liberals in angry dissent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=108.24s)]
*  While the court's two-page order is technically temporary, its language is pretty final. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=115.52s)]
*  For instance, it carves out the Federal Reserve Board as different, knowing that the idea of enabling the president to fire Federal Reserve Board members has repeatedly spooked the markets. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=120.72s)]
*  The court majority thus made a point of saying that the Fed is different and is insulated from at-will firing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  Writing for the three dissenters, Justice Kagan blasted the majority for taking the extraordinary step of overturning a nearly century-old precedent, quote, by fiat, without full briefing and arguments. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=137.84s)]
*  What matters most here, she said, is that Congress provided for these leaders to serve full terms, protected from a president's desire to substitute his political allies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=151.04s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=161.84s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked Oklahoma from creating the nation's first publicly funded religious charter school. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  The Supreme Court's tie vote meant a decision by Oklahoma's highest court stays in place, barring the charter school. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=170.8s)]
*  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett had recused herself from the decision. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=178.16s)]
*  The Oklahoma charter school had sought taxpayer dollars. It said it would be a genuine instrument of the Catholic Church, led by church doctrine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=183.44s)]
*  Activist Mahmoud Khalil has asked a U.S. immigration judge for asylum. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=193.28s)]
*  The Trump administration is trying to deport Khalil over his pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=197.28s)]
*  NPR's Adrian Florido reports Khalil says he fears the state of Israel could kill him if he is deported. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=203.76s)]
*  Khalil testified in a courtroom at the Louisiana Detention Center where he's been locked up since ICE agents arrested him in early March. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  He said that since President Trump accused him, falsely he says, of supporting Hamas terrorism, he's had a target on his back. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=217.44s)]
*  He told the judge that if he's deported to the Middle East, he fears Israeli agents could assassinate, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=225.04s)]
*  kidnap, or torture him because he's become a high-profile Palestinian critic of Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=230.24s)]
*  His wife brought their one-month-old son from New York so Khalil could meet him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=235.6s)]
*  Each time the baby cooed inside the courtroom, Khalil looked over and smiled. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=240.24s)]
*  The immigration judge will rule on asylum next month. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=244.64s)]
*  A different federal judge is also weighing whether to free Khalil while he fights his deportation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=247.83999999999997s)]
*  Adrian Florido, NPR News. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=252.88s)]
*  Federal authorities have filed first-degree murder charges against the suspect accused of killing two Israeli embassy staffers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  Yaron Lechinsky and Sarah Milgram were shot and killed outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C. as they left an event. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=262.08s)]
*  Milgram grew up in Kansas City, Kansas, suburb. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=269.28s)]
*  From member station KCUR, Salisa Kolakal reports on how Milgram's family is remembering her. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=272.64s)]
*  Milgram, who was 26, grew up in Prairie Village, Kansas. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  Her father, Robert Milgram, told KCUR he thinks education is important to stopping these acts of violence. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=283.12s)]
*  Many different people living in the U.S., there's no reason to hate one another. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  This hate cannot divide us. We need to overcome it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=294.32s)]
*  The temple where Sarah worshiped said in a statement that her commitment to Judaism was deeply personal and described her as a radiant presence. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=297.12s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Salisa Kolakal in Kansas City. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  Numerous events are being held in Minneapolis over the next few days. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  They'll mark five years since the police murder of George Floyd. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=313.68s)]
*  From Minnesota Public Radio, Matt Sepick has more. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=317.44s)]
*  George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in 2020 after a white police officer kneeled on his neck and back for more than nine minutes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=320.56s)]
*  The killing, captured on video, sparked a worldwide racial justice movement. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=328.88s)]
*  Events to honor Floyd and the movement include concerts, a street festival, art exhibits, and a candlelight vigil. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=333.36s)]
*  Matt Sepick reporting. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=339.76s)]
*  Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to decades behind bars [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=341.12s)]
*  after being convicted on federal and state charges, including second-degree murder. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=346.32s)]
*  Chauvin is currently being held out of federal prison in Texas. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=351.44s)]
*  The Trump administration plans to stop minting pennies. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=355.52s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reports the federal government has been losing money on the one-cent coins [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=359.28s)]
*  because each penny costs nearly four cents to make. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=365.12s)]
*  The phase out is expected to save the government about $56 million a year in reduced material costs. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=368.48s)]
*  Pennies will remain legal tender, which is good since there are about $114 billion of them floating around out there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=374.8s)]
*  Most don't really circulate, though. Instead, they gather dust in dresser-top change jars and forgotten pants pockets. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=380.88s)]
*  The phase out of the penny may force businesses to round prices up or down to the nearest nickel. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=388.08s)]
*  That's less of a hassle, though, now that customers pay cash for fewer than one in five transactions. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=393.44s)]
*  Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=398.64s)]
*  Federal authorities say six people were aboard a private plane that crashed into a military [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=401.28s)]
*  neighborhood in San Diego yesterday before dawn. A music agency says three of its employees were [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aAE-4HjGYA&t=406.23999999999995s)]
