*  and girls' sports. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=12.200000000000001s)]

*  his calendar. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=34.64s)]

*  steps to facilitate the release of Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=53.44s)]
*  Zines says the administration has shown, quote, nothing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=57.72s)]
*  While she did not immediately hold the government in contempt of court, she said the documents [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=61.12s)]
*  and testimony will help her weigh whether or not the Trump administration has complied. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=65.53999999999999s)]

*  I hope to have the chance to actually see Kilmar and see what his condition is, but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=96.56s)]
*  we are going to keep fighting because this is a miscarriage of justice. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=102.8s)]
*  Van Hollen requested to meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who said he's not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=107.32s)]

*  Maine Democratic Governor Janet Mills has refused to comply. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  She says she has a duty to follow state law. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=133.16s)]
*  This morning, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi explained why her agency is suing Maine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=136.3s)]
*  This is a violation of Title IX. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=141.52s)]
*  The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  This is about sports. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=152.02s)]
*  This is also about these young women's personal safety. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=153.22000000000003s)]
*  The Trump administration has tried to force Maine to obey. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  It has moved to cut off all of Maine's funding for public schools over the issue of trans [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=160.34s)]
*  athletes, and it has also tried to cut off funding for school lunch programs. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=165.14s)]

*  It says the legal definition of a woman in that country is a person who was born biologically [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=173.22s)]
*  female. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=179.1s)]
*  From London, NPR's Lauren Freyer reports the long-running legal battle began in Scotland. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  The Scottish government argued transgender people with a certificate should be entitled [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  to sex-based protections. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=190.76s)]
*  But a group of gender-critical feminists called For Women Scotland sued to limit that to people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  born female. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=198.06s)]
*  And the Supreme Court has now sided unanimously with them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=199.28s)]
*  Judge Patrick Hodge read out the ruling. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=204.86s)]
*  2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  In court, campaigners cheered and punched the air, but Hodge said this should not be [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=217.66s)]
*  seen as a triumph for one side or the other, and that the law still gives protection to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=221.76s)]
*  transgender people against discrimination. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=226.18s)]

*  The Trump administration and Harvard University are clashing over billions of dollars in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=231.22s)]
*  federal funding, but college educators are expressing relief that Harvard is defying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=235.96s)]
*  the Trump administration's policy demands. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=241.2s)]
*  NPR's Janaki Mehta explains. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=243.94s)]
*  Harvard has become the first university to formally reject the Trump administration's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=246.3s)]
*  demands that it drastically change its admissions, hiring and other policies in order to get [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=250.34s)]
*  federal money, primarily used for research. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  Now the Trump administration has frozen over $2.2 billion in funding for the university [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=258.82s)]
*  and threatened to remove its tax-exempt status. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=263.56s)]
*  Here's Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents hundreds [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=267.1s)]
*  of colleges. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  If Harvard hadn't stood up, it would have sent a chill across higher education that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=272.62s)]
*  would have hampered the ability of other institutions to define for themselves where that red line [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=277.06s)]
*  is. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=282.26s)]
*  Now university professors and leaders are involved in at least two major lawsuits against [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=283.26s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=287.29999999999995s)]
*  Janaki Mehta, NPR News. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  The measles outbreak in Texas continues to grow, with 20 more cases reported over the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  past five days. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=296.26s)]
*  As NPR's Ping Huang reports, the costs of containing the measles outbreak are also mounting. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=297.88s)]
*  The outbreak started in late January and has now grown to more than 600 cases across Texas, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=303.9s)]
*  New Mexico and Oklahoma. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=309.12s)]
*  Dr. David Sugarman is a senior scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=310.8s)]
*  working on its measles response. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=316.28s)]
*  You know, the estimates are that each measles case can be $30,000 to $50,000 for public [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  health response work, and that adds up quite quickly. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=323.48s)]
*  A measles outbreak in New York City back in 2018 had around 650 confirmed cases and cost [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  more than $8 million to bring under control. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=333.48s)]
*  Sugarman says Texas has been asking for resources and help. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=336.8s)]
*  The state lost several hundred million dollars in public health funding and a federal clawback [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=340.36s)]
*  of COVID funds that began late last month. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  Ping Huang and NPR News. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=347.64s)]
*  President Trump has signed a new executive order. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=350.2s)]
*  It's aimed at reducing prescription drug prices. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=353.2s)]
*  The order has several parts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=356.24s)]
*  As NPR's Sydney Lepkin reports, these touch on drug importation, Medicare drug price negotiations, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=358.14s)]
*  and more. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=364.64s)]
*  The president signed an executive order instructing the administration to advance cost-cutting [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=365.64s)]
*  moves like increasing generic drug competition. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=369.36s)]
*  The order also aims to improve Medicare drug price negotiation, which passed as part of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=372.12s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Biden in 2022. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=376.0s)]
*  An official said he thinks the Trump administration can get more savings than the Biden administration. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=380.0s)]
*  Because the number of drugs subject to negotiation increases each year, greater savings over [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=384.96s)]
*  time were baked into the law. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=388.96s)]
*  The order also instructs the FDA to facilitate state programs to import lower-cost drugs [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=391.23999999999995s)]

*  A Moscow court has convicted four Russian journalists on extremism charges and sentenced [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=398.44s)]
*  them to prison. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=403.62s)]

*  leader Alexei Navalny. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  From Moscow, NPR's Charles Maines has more. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  The four journalists all acknowledged they covered Navalny's career and trials for Russian [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=414.56s)]
*  and international media outlets. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=418.88s)]
*  One, videographer Antonina Favorskaya, even filmed Navalny's final known appearance in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=420.96s)]
*  a court hearing just a day before his death under mysterious circumstances in a remote [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=425.68s)]

*  Authorities accused the reporters of using their journalists' credentials to collect [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=433.24s)]
*  material for Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization the Russian government banned [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  as extremists back in 2021. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSgPGY2aOcI&t=441.04s)]
