# Shock In Washington After Trump Taps Gaetz For AG | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc)
*  President-elect Donald Trump says he plans to nominate former Florida Congressman Matt [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=0.0s)]
*  Gates to be attorney general. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=4.44s)]
*  And Pennsylvania's top elections official is ordering a recount in the state's U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Senate race. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Lawyers in Washington and veterans of the Justice Department are urging the Senate to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=16.64s)]
*  conduct a full vetting of Matt Gates. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=20.56s)]
*  NPR's Carrie Johnson reports the former Florida Congressman is president-elect Donald Trump's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=23.28s)]
*  nominee to lead the Justice Department. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=28.74s)]
*  Trump's selection of Matt Gates for attorney general shocked people inside the DOJ and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=31.58s)]
*  even many Republicans on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=36.74s)]
*  Gates is a frequent critic of the Justice Department and FBI, and from 2019 until last [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=39.78s)]
*  year he was under federal investigation for sex trafficking. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  That investigation ended with no criminal charges, but a separate House ethics probe [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=49.24s)]
*  had been underway at the time of Gates's resignation from Congress. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=54.1s)]
*  Senator Greg Nunziata says the Senate needs to impose a character and fitness test on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=58.18s)]
*  some of Trump's cabinet nominations. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=62.94s)]
*  Trump's floated the idea of bypassing Senate confirmation to try to install some of his [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=65.66s)]
*  picks during a congressional recess. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=70.18s)]
*  Carrie Johnson, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=72.9s)]
*  Pennsylvania's top elections official is ordering a recount of ballots in the state's U.S. Senate [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=75.7s)]
*  race. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=81.06s)]
*  The Associated Press has called the Senate race for Republican David McCormick. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=82.06s)]
*  NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports Pennsylvania state law requires a recount because of the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=86.66s)]
*  small margin of votes separating the two leading candidates. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=91.86s)]
*  About 29,000 votes, or less than half of one percent of the ballots cast in Pennsylvania, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=95.94s)]
*  separate Republican David McCormick and the Democratic incumbent, Senator Bob Casey. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=100.94s)]
*  That's why Pennsylvania's Secretary of the Commonwealth, Al Schmidt, has ordered an automatic [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=105.5s)]
*  statewide recount of ballots. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  The Associated Press declared McCormick the winner last week. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=111.14s)]
*  At the time, the AP concluded there were not enough uncounted ballots in areas supporting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  Casey for the Democrat to ultimately take the lead. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=117.54s)]
*  Still, Casey has not conceded. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=120.62s)]
*  And in court filings, McCormick and Republican allies have signaled preparations to challenge [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=122.5s)]
*  the counting of some provisional ballots. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  The final outcome of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race is not expected to change the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=129.46s)]
*  balance of power in the new Senate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  Republicans are set to be in the majority. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=135.38s)]
*  Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=137.06s)]
*  A group of Republican-led House subcommittees held a hearing yesterday on Unidentified Anomalous [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=138.58s)]
*  Phenomena, or UAPs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=144.98s)]
*  These are also known as UFOs. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=147.78s)]
*  Lawmakers questioned some witnesses about unproven allegations that the federal government [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=150.3s)]
*  has been concealing unexplained phenomena. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  Former NASA official Michael Gold says there should be an open review of all the data the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=158.7s)]
*  government has on UAPs. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=163.66s)]
*  I think probably the vast majority of UAP are drones, experimental aircraft, weather conditions, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  which is again why I say if we review the data, I think we're going to discover a lot [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=173.38s)]
*  about things we weren't even thinking about. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=176.22s)]
*  But there is a percentage that isn't. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=178.26s)]
*  The Pentagon issued a report last March. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=181.16s)]
*  It says the Defense Department has found no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=184.06s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcQnZ4hwNc&t=190.22s)]
