# Trump's Popularity Wanes As He Marks 100 Days In Office | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY)
*  More than 100 immigrants who are in the US illegally were detained in a raid Sunday in Colorado. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=0.0s)]
*  And the ACLU says a two-year-old girl was one of three US children who were deported by the Trump administration last week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=13.5s)]
*  Federal law enforcement officials say they have arrested more than 100 immigrants who are in the US illegally. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=18.0s)]
*  They were detained early Sunday morning in a Colorado raid. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=24.0s)]
*  NPR's Joe Hernandez reports authorities say they targeted an underground nightclub. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=28.0s)]
*  Video posted online by the Drug Enforcement Administration shows patrons streaming out of the front doors of the club and being detained by law enforcement officers waiting outside. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=33.0s)]
*  The DEA said the raid led to the capture of 114 immigrants in the US without legal status, as well as the seizure of guns and illegal drugs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=43.0s)]
*  Attorney General Pam Bondi said the club was frequented by gang members. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=53.0s)]
*  NPR could not immediately verify the immigration status of those arrested and whether there's any evidence of gang membership. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=58.0s)]
*  A DEA official said in a video posted online by a local news outlet that more than a dozen active-duty service members were also in the club, either as patrons or working as armed security guards. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=65.0s)]
*  Joe Hernandez, NPR News. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=77.0s)]
*  Separately, court cases are underway as some migrants and lawyers try to stop their deportations. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=80.0s)]
*  One case involves a family from New Orleans. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=86.0s)]
*  The mother does not have legal status, but her two-year-old daughter is an American citizen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=88.0s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports that during a regular immigration check-in, the family was detained and then deported to Honduras. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=94.0s)]
*  The judge in this case, who was appointed by President Trump, seems concerned about how this was handled. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=101.0s)]
*  And he has now set a hearing for next month with the goal of dispelling his, quote, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=106.0s)]
*  strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process, unquote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=110.0s)]
*  According to the ACLU, this is one of three US children deported from the US, along with mothers without legal status last week. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=116.0s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reporting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=122.0s)]
*  A Wisconsin county judge is scheduled to have a preliminary hearing next month. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=125.0s)]
*  Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested last Friday by federal authorities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=130.0s)]
*  She was charged with helping a migrant who was in the US illegally to avoid arrest. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=134.0s)]
*  Wisconsin Democratic officials say the arrest is a deliberate effort to intimidate the third and co-equal branch of American government, the judiciary. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=139.0s)]
*  President Trump says officials need to take action. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=148.0s)]
*  You know, we have a country. We have to be proud of our country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=151.0s)]
*  We can't let these people stay, and the courts are allowing them to stay. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=154.0s)]
*  And we're not going to — we're just not going to allow it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=157.0s)]
*  So hopefully the Supreme Court will come to the rescue of our country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=159.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Judge Dugan has issued a statement through an attorney. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=163.0s)]
*  She says she is committed to the rule of law and the principles of due process. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=166.0s)]
*  Dugan says she will defend herself vigorously. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=171.0s)]
*  President Trump will mark his first 100 days in office starting tomorrow. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=175.0s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid reports the date is considered a milestone as observers take stock of a president's early record. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=179.0s)]
*  The idea of measuring a president by what he's done in 100 days is no doubt somewhat arbitrary. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=187.0s)]
*  But it goes back to the 1930s and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=193.0s)]
*  Trump has acted more swiftly and more aggressively than his first term to enact sweeping change, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=197.0s)]
*  shrinking the size of the federal government, dismantling agencies, taking over cultural institutions, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=204.0s)]
*  cracking down on immigrants and upending the economic system with his tariff plans. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=210.0s)]
*  But as he's done this, polls show the president's popularity is falling. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=215.0s)]
*  As he reaches this 100-day milestone, polling shows his approval rating at this point is lower than any other president in recent history. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=220.0s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=229.0s)]
*  Russia says it will implement a unilateral temporary ceasefire running from May 8 to May 10. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=232.0s)]
*  Russia is going to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=237.0s)]
*  It's calling on Ukraine to follow suit, but this comes after Russia declared a ceasefire for Easter. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=241.0s)]
*  Both Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for breaking that truce. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=246.0s)]
*  The news comes after President Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the weekend at the Vatican. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=250.0s)]
*  NPR's Joanna Kokissus reports from Ukraine. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=256.0s)]
*  The two men met at the Vatican before attending the funeral of Pope Francis. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=259.0s)]
*  Oleksandr Merechko, who is a lawmaker with Zelenskyy's party, says the meeting gives him hope. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=263.0s)]
*  There is nothing like direct face-to-face dialogue between both presidents, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=269.0s)]
*  because this is the only way how all misunderstandings can be removed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=274.0s)]
*  However, the Trump administration has been pressing Ukraine to accommodate Russian demands [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=279.0s)]
*  and is offering very little to Ukraine in return. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=284.0s)]
*  Joanna Kokissus, NPR News, Kyiv. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=287.0s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed at least 70 people in the last 24 hours. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=290.0s)]
*  That's according to Gaza health officials. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=296.0s)]
*  The rising death toll comes as food is run out for most people in Gaza. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=298.0s)]
*  The UN says its food supplies are fully depleted due to Israel's total aid blockade now in its second month. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=303.0s)]
*  And Piers Anas Baba has more from Gaza City. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=310.0s)]
*  The UN World Food Program says it has no more lentils, beans or pasta to supply the charity kitchens [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=313.0s)]
*  that half of Gaza's population depends on. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=320.0s)]
*  50-year-old Majid Al-Sakani waited more than two hours for some cooked rice for her family yesterday. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=323.0s)]
*  This kitchen is her only source of food. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=329.0s)]
*  If this hot kitchen shuts down, we will reach total famine, she says. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=333.0s)]
*  She cannot afford the canned food sold in the markets, where eggs, dairy and meat are no longer available. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=337.0s)]
*  Israel says the blockade is meant to pressure Hamas to release hostages and lay down arms. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=343.0s)]
*  Human rights groups and aid agencies say it's collective punishment and illegal under international law. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=349.0s)]
*  Anas Baba, NPR News, Gaza City. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=355.0s)]
*  The Vatican has announced the start date for a papal conclave. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=359.0s)]
*  It's Wednesday, May 7th. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=362.0s)]
*  Members of the Roman Catholic College of Cardinals will sequester themselves inside the historic Sistine Chapel. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=363.0s)]
*  Eligible cardinals will then vote to select the next pope. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=370.0s)]
*  They will remain sequestered in the Vatican until the next pontiff is chosen. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=374.0s)]
*  Moose are on the move in Sweden. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=379.0s)]
*  They've begun their annual migration across the northern part of the country. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=381.0s)]
*  NPR's Ayanna Archie reports millions of people are tuning in to watch. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=385.0s)]
*  Each spring, hundreds of moose journey from their winter hangout spot to their summer one, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=390.0s)]
*  which is in the mountains near the Sweden-Norway border. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=395.0s)]
*  They're looking for new food sources as well as a nice place to raise their calves. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=398.0s)]
*  Since 2019, Swedish public broadcaster SVT has livestreamed the trip. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=402.0s)]
*  More than nine million people watched around the world last year, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=407.0s)]
*  and viewership is expected to be even higher this year. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=410.0s)]
*  That's according to an executive producer of the livestream. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=413.0s)]
*  The program is an indication of how popular the slow TV genre has become. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=416.0s)]
*  Slow TV includes live, unedited, and hours or even months long coverage of some routine event, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=420.0s)]
*  usually with a theme or journey in mind. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=426.0s)]
*  Ayanna Archie, NPR News. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=429.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXbnrMFr_tY&t=431.0s)]
