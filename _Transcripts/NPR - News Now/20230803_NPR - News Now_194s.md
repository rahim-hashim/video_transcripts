# Trump To Be Arraigned On Election Results Charges In D.C. Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA)
*  Former President Donald Trump will be arraigned in a federal courtroom today in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=0.0s)]
*  and Secretary of State Antony Blinken is chairing a U.N. Security Council meeting on famine and conflict. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=5.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=11.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump will be arraigned in federal court today in Washington. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=16.0s)]
*  This is on charges he participated in an alleged conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=20.0s)]
*  A federal grand jury is investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=27.0s)]
*  Former Vice President Mike Pence is again separating his actions from Trump's over the insurrection. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=32.0s)]
*  Sadly, the president was surrounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=38.0s)]
*  And while I made my case to him of what I understood my oath of the Constitution to require the president ultimately, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=45.0s)]
*  ultimately, you know, continue to demand that I choose him over the Constitution. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=52.0s)]
*  But Pence says he wishes the decision about Trump's actions had been left to voters, not the Justice Department. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=58.0s)]
*  Pence says it is not clear to him that federal prosecutors have enough evidence to prove their case against Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=64.0s)]
*  July was the hottest month on record. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=71.0s)]
*  Human-caused climate change is fueling the rising temperatures, but there's been little action from Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=73.0s)]
*  NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports that a new NPR, PBS NewsHour, Marist poll reveals why. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=79.0s)]
*  A majority of Americans say climate change is an immediate threat and it's affecting their communities now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=86.0s)]
*  But that's not the case for Republicans. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=91.0s)]
*  Three quarters of Republican respondents say to prioritize the economy even if it means ignoring climate change. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=93.0s)]
*  And 80 percent say climate change will only represent a minor threat in the future or none at all. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=99.0s)]
*  With majorities in Congress as narrow as they are, there has to be cooperation from both sides to get something meaningful done. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=105.0s)]
*  But this poll shows a large segment of the electorate turning away from the climate crisis even as it gets worse. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=111.0s)]
*  Domenico Montanaro, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=118.0s)]
*  Dangerous and record-breaking heat persists in the central and southwestern U.S. today. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=120.0s)]
*  In Phoenix, temperatures could hit 117 degrees today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=125.0s)]
*  The heat indexes from Kansas to Alabama could exceed 110 degrees. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=129.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is chairing a U.N. Security Council meeting today on famine and conflict. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=135.0s)]
*  NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports he's announcing several hundred million dollars in aid. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=141.0s)]
*  According to his aid, Secretary Blinken is not seeking to turn this Security Council meeting into a showdown with Russia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=147.0s)]
*  But he will raise concerns about Russia's war in Ukraine and its recent decision to withdraw from a deal that allowed Ukraine to export food through the Black Sea. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=154.0s)]
*  Blinken will be asking countries to sign on to a communique that condemns the use of food as a weapon of war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=163.0s)]
*  U.S. officials say more than 75 countries have already joined. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=169.0s)]
*  They say the secretary will also talk about long-term solutions to food insecurity [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=173.0s)]
*  and will announce $362 million in new funding for nearly a dozen African nations as well as for Haiti. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=178.0s)]
*  Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, the State Department. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=186.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J37rVfohWkA&t=193.0s)]
