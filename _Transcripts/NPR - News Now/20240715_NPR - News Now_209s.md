# The RNC Kicks Off Today In Milwaukee, Wisconsin | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA)
*  The FBI is reviewing two key pieces of evidence from the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=0.0s)]
*  And a hurricane and a heat wave combined to boost the number of people going to Houston emergency rooms. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=6.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  The FBI continues to investigate this weekend's attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=16.8s)]
*  They have identified the 20-year-old man they say is the alleged shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=22.6s)]
*  He was shot and killed at the scene. NPR's Ryan Lucas reports the FBI official leading the investigation, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=28.6s)]
*  Kevin Rojek, says agents have gathered some vital information. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=34.6s)]
*  There are two key pieces of evidence that they have recovered that they're working on, the alleged shooter's gun and his cell phone. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Both have been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=45.2s)]
*  The FBI says the gun was purchased legally, it believes, by the shooter's father. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=49.6s)]
*  Rojek identified it as an AR-556, which is an AR-15 style rifle. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=53.6s)]
*  The cell phone, though, is an urgent focus for investigators. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=58.6s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reporting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=62.0s)]
*  The Republican National Convention officially kicks off today in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=64.0s)]
*  As NPR's Yeon Yoon Han reports, former President Trump is already in the city and ready for the event. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=68.8s)]
*  Trump, who arrived in Milwaukee on Sunday, said in a post on Truth Social that the show would go on, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=75.0s)]
*  undeterred by the shooting at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=81.6s)]
*  Trump later wrote, quote, Unite America. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  More than 2,400 delegates will rally under that message. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  The event also will have a special theme called, quote, Make America Wealthy Once Again, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=93.8s)]
*  which will focus on how Trump will fight inflation, as data now show inflation is cooling, and how he will revitalize the economy. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=99.6s)]
*  The yet-to-be-named vice president nominee will likely speak on Wednesday, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=108.4s)]
*  and Trump is expected to formally accept the presidential nomination on Thursday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=112.6s)]
*  Yeon Yoon Han, NPR News, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=117.8s)]
*  Nearly 300,000 Texas customers still don't have power back one week after Hurricane Barrel made landfall. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=121.0s)]
*  Most are in the Houston area. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=128.2s)]
*  The region suffered high heat after the storm passed, and NPR's Alejandro Barrundo reports [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=130.0s)]
*  that caused major problems for emergency departments. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=136.0s)]
*  Emergency doctor Ben Saldana has lived through a lot of hurricanes in his 20 years at Houston Methodist Hospital, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=140.0s)]
*  but a hurricane plus power outages plus a brutal heat wave made the past week one of the hardest he can remember. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=146.0s)]
*  People were streaming in with carbon monoxide poisoning from running generators, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=152.6s)]
*  or heat exhaustion from trying to clean up their backyards in extreme heat, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=156.2s)]
*  and kidney problems for those who couldn't get dialysis because of power outages or transportation issues. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=159.8s)]
*  Saldana says, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=165.0s)]
*  What that looks like is you have an ER that ramps up with people lined up 20 deep, right, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=166.2s)]
*  and you go out and you basically say, I don't like on TV, okay, who's here for dialysis, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=173.0s)]
*  He says his department was seeing nearly double the patients as normal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=178.4s)]
*  It's a problem hitting ERs more often as climate change is making hurricanes more dangerous and heat waves hotter. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=182.0s)]
*  Alejandro Barrundo, NPR News. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=187.8s)]
*  Today, the brutal heat wave in the U.S. is bearing down on the middle of the country and the East, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=189.6s)]
*  More than 130 million people are under some kind of heat alert today and feeling extreme heat outdoors. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=194.2s)]
*  The hottest temperatures and heat index values are from Iowa down to the Gulf Coast. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j19GnTiQKpA&t=205.39999999999998s)]
