*  debt ceiling looms. And Ukraine's president is meeting with leaders today in London. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kori Fakulman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=9.44s)]
*  President Biden has hinted that he and top congressional leaders may meet tomorrow [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=14.32s)]
*  to again discuss the nation's debt ceiling. As NPR's Windsor Johnston reports, the president [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  and Republican leaders sharply disagree over terms of lifting the federal government's borrowing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=23.68s)]
*  limit. Talks continued through the weekend between congressional staff and White House [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=28.72s)]
*  aides in an effort to move the needle. White House press secretary, Corrine Jean-Pierre, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=34.16s)]
*  cited some progress in discussions. The meetings have been productive and leaders [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=39.28s)]
*  wanted to continue before they regrouped. The White House and congressional leaders are up [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=44.16s)]
*  against a critical deadline to avert a potential default. Republicans are refusing to raise the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=49.76s)]
*  debt ceiling unless Democrats agree to big cuts in government spending, including major parts of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=56.0s)]

*  the border since last Thursday. That's when the Biden administration imposed new immigration [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=81.52s)]
*  restrictions. Migrants are being told to use a phone app to apply for an interview with U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=86.72s)]

*  he is also seeing a decline in the numbers of migrants attempting to cross the border. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=98.96s)]
*  Fortunately, I think a lot of immigrants are heeding the advice and trying to do what they're [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  supposed to do legally. So the numbers are not what was initially predicted. The Biden [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=108.16s)]

*  Berlin and Paris over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is now in London [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=125.44s)]
*  to sit down with the British prime minister. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports Europe pledged [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=130.96s)]

*  its coveted Charlemagne prize, which recognizes work done in the service of European unification. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=156.07999999999998s)]

*  Were it not for the heroic attitude of Volodymyr Zelensky, the European Union would now share [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=166.16s)]
*  a very long border with Russia. Putin would have gained the opportunity to destabilize [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=172.72s)]
*  all of Europe. He said European leaders draw inspiration from Zelensky. Eleanor Beardsley, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agE9xwTZ7N4&t=179.76s)]
