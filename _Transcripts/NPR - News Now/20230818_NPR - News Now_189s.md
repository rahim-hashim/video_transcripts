# Maui Official Resigns Amid Questions Over Wildfire Response | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s)
*  The head of Maui's embattled Emergency Management Agency has resigned, and a new federal report [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=0.0s)]
*  says 2023 could be one of the hottest on record. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=6.46s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=10.64s)]
*  Maui's Emergency Management Administrator has resigned a day after defending his decision [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=15.6s)]
*  not to use the island's siren system during the deadly wildfires. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=20.8s)]
*  Herman Ndea says he doesn't regret his decision because he says the sirens are mainly used [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  for tsunamis. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=29.72s)]
*  He says people would have headed to the mountains into the fire. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=30.72s)]
*  Residents dispute that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=34.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, the burn zone in Lahaina is toxic. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=35.64s)]
*  Officials are worried about asbestos and lead because of the age of the homes and businesses, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=38.64s)]
*  along with other toxic chemicals in the ash and debris. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=43.8s)]
*  And Pierce Gabriel Spitzer has more. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=47.2s)]
*  The biggest danger comes from ingesting or breathing in the toxic chemical. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=49.16s)]
*  So that means that the really acute risks go way down once the fire's out and the smoke [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=53.34s)]
*  is dissipated. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Lots of the emissions that start out as airborne particles and smoke end up settling back down [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=59.2s)]
*  into ash and soot and they cling to surfaces, they run off into the water. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  And that means people could be exposed over and over for a really long time. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=68.28s)]
*  And Pierce Gabriel Spitzer. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=72.68s)]
*  At least 111 people died, about 1,000 are listed as missing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=74.28s)]
*  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this year could be one of the hottest [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=79.0s)]
*  in recorded history. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  And Pierce Shea Byrom has more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=84.72s)]
*  Last month marked the hottest July since 1850. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=86.68s)]
*  South America, Africa, and Asia saw record warm temperatures. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=90.04s)]
*  Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and Maine also experienced their hottest July on record. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, about 30% of the U.S. is experiencing drought, says NOAA climatologist Karen Gleason. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=100.12s)]
*  Drought conditions expanded or intensified across much of the deep south and parts of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=106.76s)]
*  the southwest, as well as the northwest and extreme northern tier. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=112.16s)]
*  Scientists say most of the U.S. will continue seeing above normal temperatures through November. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  Shama Byrom and PR News. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=122.12s)]
*  North Carolina's Democratic governor will soon decide whether to veto sweeping elections [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=124.28s)]
*  legislation approved this week by the state's Republican-dominated legislature. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=130.0s)]
*  For Member Station WUNC, Rusty Jacobs has more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=134.76s)]
*  The GOP bill would eliminate a three-day grace period for counting mail and ballots [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=138.4s)]
*  postmarked by Election Day. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=142.6s)]
*  Republicans say that would boost voter confidence in Election Day results. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=145.36s)]
*  But Democrats in the North Carolina General Assembly note the grace period was established [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=149.44s)]
*  in 2009 through bipartisan legislation and that claims of widespread voter fraud are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  baseless. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=159.96s)]
*  State Representative Robert Reeves worries eliminating the grace period could result [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=161.44s)]
*  in otherwise valid votes getting tossed due only to unreliable postal service. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=165.84s)]
*  We are making it harder for people to have a voice. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=170.96s)]
*  Governor Roy Cooper is likely to veto the bill, but Republicans have the legislative [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=174.6s)]
*  supermajority to override it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=178.78s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Rusty Jacobs in Durham, North Carolina. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kp3dZEjs8s&t=181.12s)]
