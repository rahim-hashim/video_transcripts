# N.J. AG: Birthright Citizenship Order 'Upended The Rule Of Law' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM)
*  Democratically led states suing over President Trump's move to end birthright citizenship [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=0.0s)]
*  say the issue is set a law and Mexico has launched a new app for Mexican nationals facing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=4.7s)]
*  detention or deportation in the U.S. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=10.26s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=13.42s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=14.42s)]
*  The Trump administration says federal agents can now go into places previously off limits [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=17.98s)]
*  to remove migrants. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=22.6s)]
*  That includes children's schools, hospitals and churches. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=24.14s)]
*  This is part of Trump's executive actions on immigration that includes his move to end [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=27.54s)]
*  birthright citizenship, a right protected by the U.S. Constitution. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=31.66s)]
*  New Jersey and several democratically led states are suing over the issue. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=35.94s)]
*  New Jersey State Attorney General Matthew Plotkin says birthright citizenship is settled [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=39.82s)]
*  law. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=44.46s)]
*  It's been upheld by the Supreme Court multiple times. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=45.46s)]
*  This is until Monday night, not something that was ever contested by a president who [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=49.44s)]
*  signed an order that was extraordinary, unprecedented and upended the rule of law. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=56.38s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's Morning Edition. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=61.38s)]
*  There's no word yet of any major immigration raids that are expected to target sanctuary [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=64.18s)]
*  jurisdictions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=69.10000000000001s)]
*  Trump administration officials have said that Chicago could be one of the cities targeted. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=70.78s)]
*  From member station WBEZ, Mawa Iqbal reports, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is vowing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=76.1s)]
*  to protect state residents who are in the U.S. illegally. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=82.42s)]
*  Pritzker says he still has not heard any concrete plans from President Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=86.38s)]
*  He reiterated at a press conference that people with criminal convictions who don't have [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=90.9s)]
*  legal status should be deported. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=95.14s)]
*  However, he says the threat of deportation is looming over Chicago's immigrant neighborhoods, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=97.5s)]
*  some of which he visited Monday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=103.34s)]
*  I was in businesses yesterday that were relatively empty because people are afraid to show up, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=105.22s)]
*  because even documented immigrants, even citizens who are from another country but [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=111.78s)]
*  now are citizens of the United States have relatives who are undocumented, they're afraid. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=116.74s)]
*  The Chicago City Council last week blocked an ordinance that would allow Chicago police [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=121.3s)]
*  to work with federal immigration authorities. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=125.38s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Mawa Iqbal in Springfield, Illinois. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=128.34s)]
*  Mexico has launched a new app for Mexican nationals who are facing deportation or detention [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=131.86s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=137.34s)]
*  Arizona public media's Paola Rodriguez reports it explains their legal rights and steps to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  take in emergencies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  The console app also contains a button for users to alert their emergency contacts and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=146.38s)]
*  officials at the nearest consulate if they're facing detention. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=151.38s)]
*  Rafael Marcelo Durazo heads the Mexican consulate in Tucson, Arizona, and says the app comes [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=155.38s)]
*  at a time when calls from Mexican nationals are flooding their call center. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=161.5s)]
*  The app is making easier the access to communicate with the consulates anytime, but particularly [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=165.82s)]
*  now that so many people are concerned about what is going to mean all the migratory changes [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=171.38s)]
*  that the new administration has announced. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=177.26s)]
*  On Monday alone, the consulate received over 1,500 calls about what to do amid mass deportation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=179.42s)]
*  concerns. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=185.9s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Paola Rodriguez in Tucson. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=187.06s)]
*  In Trump's nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth is facing new misconduct accusations. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=191.14s)]
*  His former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, has signed an affidavit alleging he drank [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=197.14s)]
*  heavily and abused his former wife, Samantha. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=201.94s)]
*  At his confirmation hearing, Hegseth rejected similar misconduct and sexual assault accusations. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=205.22s)]
*  NPR's Deirdre Walsh says Hegseth's lawyer is contradicting the new allegations. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=211.5s)]
*  NPR reached out to his attorney, Tim Parlatori. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=215.62s)]
*  He has not responded. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  So, Parlatori told NBC, which first reported on this affidavit, that Samantha Hegseth, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=220.54s)]
*  this ex-wife, never alleged any abuse and actually signed court documents acknowledging [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=225.98s)]
*  there was no abuse, and she affirmed that as part of Hegseth's background check. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=231.34s)]
*  And here is Deirdre Walsh reporting. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=236.1s)]
*  President Trump's executive actions on energy also call for boosting resource development [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=239.12s)]
*  in Alaska. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=243.62s)]
*  Republican leaders in Alaska are praising these, but Alaska public media's Liz Ruskin [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=245.14s)]
*  reports environmental groups are pledging to fight the president's actions. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  The order covers nearly every Alaska land use controversy this century. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=254.22s)]
*  It calls for new oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and roads across [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=258.74s)]
*  protected federal land to help logging and mining. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=263.94s)]
*  It's exactly what Alaska's all-Republican congressional delegation wanted. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=267.58s)]
*  But Alaskans who advocated for these protections are seeing years of work erased. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=273.02s)]
*  Conservation advocates are ramping up for lawsuits. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  As for Trump's order to restore the name Mount McKinley, a new poll by Alaska Survey Research [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=282.06s)]
*  found Alaskans by a wide margin favored the mountain's current name, Denali. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=287.8s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Liz Ruskin. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=293.12s)]
*  President Trump invited three executives to the White House yesterday to announce a new [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=296.24s)]
*  venture known as Stargate. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=300.26s)]
*  NPR's Chairman Keith reports it's a large investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  The CEOs of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle said 10 massive data centers that will be used [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  to run AI technology are already under construction in Texas. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  And more could be possible. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=317.74s)]
*  They praised Trump and he in turn praised the multi-billion dollar investment. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=319.16s)]
*  This monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  under a new president. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=329.88000000000005s)]
*  Let me be a new president. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=332.74s)]
*  I didn't say it, they did. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=334.86s)]
*  Trump has a history of inviting executives to make splashy announcements like this one [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=336.5s)]
*  at the White House, though they haven't always lived up to the hype. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=340.74s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News, the White House. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=344.66s)]
*  Britain's Prince Harry and a senior British lawmaker have reached a settlement against [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=347.42s)]
*  tabloid newspapers owned by billionaire Rupert Murdoch. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=351.14s)]
*  They had accused the papers of hacking their phones and invading their privacy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=354.42s)]
*  The settlement of the lawsuit ends the chance of a trial in London. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=359.02s)]
*  That was expected to reveal evidence that might have been damaging to Murdoch and some [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=363.1s)]
*  of the tabloid executives. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=368.3s)]
*  Israel has launched a new operation in the occupied West Bank with arrests and deaths [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=370.8s)]
*  reported among Palestinians there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=375.5s)]
*  But about 50 miles away in the Palestinian Gaza Strip, a ceasefire deal between Israel [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=378.06s)]
*  and Hamas is holding for the fourth day. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=383.16s)]
*  NPR's Ea Batraoui reports. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=386.14s)]
*  From the southern city of Rafah to the edges of northern Jabalia, the Gaza Strip lies in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=390.02s)]
*  ruins, the result of more than a year of war and sustained Israeli airstrikes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=395.06s)]
*  Palestinians are able to see now what's left of their homes in areas Israeli forces have [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  withdrawn from. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=404.62s)]
*  But there's little reprieve here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=405.62s)]
*  Entire neighborhoods have been leveled, turning cities into gray mounds of rubble as far [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=407.65999999999997s)]
*  as the eye can see. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=412.06s)]
*  Gaza's health ministry says more than 47,000 people were killed by Israeli fire in the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=413.78s)]
*  war. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=418.06s)]
*  Local health officials say they've recovered around 150 bodies from the rubble and decay [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=419.1s)]
*  of different parts of Gaza since the ceasefire began Sunday. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=423.22s)]
*  And they estimate more than 10,000 bodies remain missing under the rubble. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w8uMtK8BiM&t=427.12s)]
