*  As you can imagine, it's the middle of the night, you know, what type of traffic was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmV4nyS1cI&t=43.4s)]
*  there, how many workers were there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmV4nyS1cI&t=47.88s)]
*  Workers, you know, they obviously come to a project, but other workers show up sometimes, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmV4nyS1cI&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  so that's what we're investigating right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmV4nyS1cI&t=54.64s)]
