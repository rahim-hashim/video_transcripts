# Israel's Parliament Passes Controversial Law Limiting Judicial Oversight | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, July 24th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=0.0s)]
*  are today's top stories. Lawmakers in the Israeli parliament have passed a controversial [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=5.04s)]
*  judicial reform bill. The measure has drawn fiery condemnation from opponents who say [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=10.24s)]
*  it will significantly damage Israel's democracy. Supporters in the ruling party say they want [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=15.32s)]
*  to stop the Israeli Supreme Court from overreaching. There is so much fury about the judicial reform [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=20.52s)]
*  legislation that some members of professional groups such as doctors have gone on strike briefly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=26.68s)]
*  Some military reservists in Israel have said they won't work either. Today is the deadline [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=32.04s)]
*  for Texas Governor Greg Abbott to respond to the Justice Department over floating barriers in the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=37.72s)]
*  Rio Grande. As Texas Public Radio's David Martin Davies reports, the federal agency is threatening [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=43.32s)]
*  Texas with legal action. Last week, the Biden administration sent the Texas governor's office [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=49.44s)]
*  notice that it wanted to enter into negotiations over the removal of the buoy barrier. Abbott [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=55.0s)]
*  ordered the floating wall placed in the middle of the river separating the United States and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=60.6s)]
*  Mexico to prevent migrants from illegally crossing into Texas. The DOJ says the buoys violate federal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=64.88s)]
*  law, raise humanitarian concerns, and present serious risk to public safety and the environment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=72.2s)]
*  The buoy wall is the latest development in a growing battle between Republican states [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=78.68s)]
*  and the federal government over the border and immigration. Abbott signaled on Twitter he is not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=83.72s)]
*  backing down writing, quote, We'll see you in court, Mr. President. I'm David Martin Davies in San [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=89.0s)]
*  Antonio. A new survey from the National Association for Business Economics shows considerable [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=94.88s)]
*  optimism about the U.S. economy. Steve Bechner reports those results run counter to speculation [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=100.84s)]
*  over the past year that the U.S. economy was in risk of going into recession. Actual business [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  conditions are turning out better than many had feared. NABE President Julia Coronado says the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=112.72s)]
*  survey of her members, quote, reflects an economy of rising sales and profits. The business economists [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=118.96s)]
*  say their firms were able to increase prices at the same time their material costs fell and upward [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=125.56s)]
*  wage pressures lessened. Coca-Cola chief economist Carlos Herrera, who chaired the NABE survey, says [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  the resulting brighter profit outlook means most firms in the group are now more confident about [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=139.32s)]
*  the economy over the next year. For NPR News, I'm Steve Bechner. The National Weather Service says [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=145.68s)]
*  excessive heat is sticking around much of the U.S. today. Millions of people, mostly in the central [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  U.S. and the West, are under heat advisories or warnings. Forecasters caution the dangerous heat [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=156.68s)]
*  will spread to much of the eastern two-thirds of the country this week. Search teams in Pennsylvania [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=162.32s)]
*  are concentrating their efforts to find a missing baby. He was swept away in a flash flood north of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=168.32s)]
*  Philadelphia more than a week ago. That flood killed six people, including his mother and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=173.92s)]
*  two-year-old sister. This is NPR. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJnUKazvuEk&t=178.88s)]
