*  is a former FEMA administrator during the Trump administration. He says the threats [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  hurt the recovery work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=80.28s)]

*  aftermath that government officials have had to repeatedly debunk. Republican vice presidential [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=100.12s)]
*  nominee JD Vance visited Minneapolis yesterday. It is the home turf of his rival, Democratic [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=106.38s)]
*  vice presidential candidate Tim Walz. Vance appeared at a former police station that was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=111.98s)]

*  Clay Masters reports. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=122.78s)]

*  up the first contingent of soldiers on the day the building was set on fire, but not [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  in time to keep rioters from overrunning the station that night. The city has since found [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=148.98s)]
*  a new location for the 3rd Precinct. However, the heavily damaged former one remains unoccupied. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIyytoZ9Ug&t=153.29999999999998s)]
