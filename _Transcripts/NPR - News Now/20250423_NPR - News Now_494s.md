*  the measles. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=12.96s)]

*  A choir sang and cardinals chanted in Latin as Pope Francis' body was carried in a red [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=29.560000000000002s)]

*  Billionaire Elon Musk says he will limit his time with the White House's cost-cutting doge [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  effort starting next month. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=79.96s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen reports the move comes after EV company Tesla, where Musk is the CEO, posted [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=81.64s)]
*  worse than expected numbers for the latest quarter. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=88.36s)]
*  On a Tesla earnings call, Musk said establishing doge within the federal government is mostly [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  done and that he expects to soon work just a day or two per week on White House matters. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=95.83999999999999s)]
*  Musk, the executive of Tesla, has been operating as a special government employee, allowing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  him to work for 130 days in government. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  But his future in the White House beyond that has always been unclear. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=108.72s)]
*  President Trump has supported the efforts of Musk, but his hard-charging approach defying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=112.36s)]
*  norms and procedures has frustrated others in the administration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=116.2s)]
*  Still, Musk said he plans to be involved in government in some fashion for as long as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=119.68s)]
*  Trump allows. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=123.44s)]

*  been let go. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=164.8s)]
*  FDA staffers responsible for handling travel arrangements for FDA inspectors are gone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=166.0s)]
*  They were cut as part of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to eliminate [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  thousands of workers from federal health agencies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=176.0s)]
*  Curran and former FDA inspectors tell NPR that will slow down inspections and make the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  U.S. food and drug supply less safe. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=183.84s)]
*  Chris Middendorf spent most of his 20 years at the FDA doing inspections. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  What you don't want to see are basically operators touching their face, messing around [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=190.44s)]
*  with their masks, touching things with their hands they shouldn't be. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=195.32s)]
*  But the only way you can see them is by standing outside the production window and watching [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=198.35999999999999s)]

*  That the measles vaccine is more dangerous than the disease, that the vaccine causes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=354.78s)]
*  autism, and that vitamin A can prevent a measles infection. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  None of these things are true. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=362.66s)]
*  But a significant proportion of adults polled thought they might be true. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=364.42s)]
*  Liz Hamill of KFF says there was a clear political divide. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=368.54s)]

*  misinformation about measles. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=378.66s)]
*  And that's true among parents as well. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  Among parents who said that at least one of these false claims was probably or definitely [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqIUr28ZQvk&t=383.26000000000005s)]
