*  The Biden administration is turning up the pressure on Israel to reconsider its plans [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=17.86s)]
*  for a potential full-scale offensive in the southern Gaza city of Ra'afah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=24.42s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Frere reports with Israel stepping up its assault, many Palestinian civilians are scrambling to get out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=30.020000000000003s)]
*  Ra'afah has been under airstrikes for months. Now it's being hit with artillery from Israeli tanks that rolled in a week ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=39.02s)]
*  Those tanks cut off the border crossing with Egypt, which is the main gateway for food and fuel coming into Gaza and injured people going out. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  Last night, Israel did say it opened a crossing in the north of Gaza to trucks carrying flour in, but hunger and shortages persist. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=53.46s)]
*  That's NPR's Lauren Frere reporting from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=61.5s)]

*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports Menendez is charged with accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=78.02s)]

*  Menendez goes on trial alongside two of the New Jersey businessmen who prosecutors say gave the senator and his wife lavish bribes, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=92.5s)]
*  including cash, Mercedes-Benz convertible and bars of gold. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=100.02s)]
*  In return, Menendez allegedly intervened in state and federal prosecutions on their behalf [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=104.06s)]
*  and uses influence as a U.S. senator to take actions benefiting their businesses, as well as the governments of Egypt and Qatar. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=109.5s)]
*  Menendez has pleaded not guilty to the 16 criminal charges he faces, including bribery and obstruction of justice. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=116.62s)]
*  He says he's being targeted because he's a prominent Latino, and he says he will prevail at trial, which is expected to last up to two months. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=123.18s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=130.66s)]
*  The supply of illicit fentanyl has increased significantly. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=133.26s)]
*  NPR's Martin Costey reports that's according to a new study funded by the National Institutes of Health. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=137.78s)]
*  The study tracks law enforcement seizures of illicit drugs and fentanyl's rise to market dominance. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=145.34s)]
*  Police seized 50,000 fentanyl pills in 2017. Last year, that number was 115 million. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=150.74s)]
*  Dr. Nora Volkov is director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the NIH. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=157.7s)]
*  She says these days, when she does research on supposed heroin users, the urine tests show that they're all really just using fentanyl. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=162.7s)]
*  None of them has heroin. Everything is fentanyl. So, yes, it has just permeated the whole illicit market. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=169.66s)]
*  The study found the fentanyl supply has expanded fastest in the western U.S., which now accounts for most of the fentanyl seized by law enforcement. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=177.54s)]
*  Martin Costey, NPR News, Seattle. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=185.34s)]
*  The criminal hush money trial of former president Donald Trump resumes in New York City today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Bernstein reports prosecutors are expected to call Trump's former attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, to the witness stand. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=194.06s)]
*  Cohen's guilty plea in 2018 set off the winding investigation that became the Manhattan DA's case, charging Trump with falsifying business records. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=203.1s)]
*  Now, Cohen will take the stand to knit together the prosecution's case. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump was so concerned about Stormy Daniels going public after the release of the Access Hollywood tape that he authorized a hush money payment to unlawfully influence the election [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=215.14s)]
*  and then covered it up by pretending to pay Cohen a legal retainer instead of a reimbursement. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  Jurors have seen checks, meeting memos, photos, and heard tape backing up Cohen's account. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=230.05999999999997s)]
*  The defense says he's an unreliable liar and that Cohen did legal work for Trump. Trump is pleaded not guilty. Andrea Bernstein, NPR News, New York. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  Having a baby is expensive. The diapers, the formula, the child care. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=244.82s)]
*  Now medical debt has become another cost of having children in America. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=250.3s)]
*  Noam Levy with NPR's partner KFF Health News has more. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=256.38s)]
*  Heather Crivellari and her husband made a lot of financial preparations before having their first child. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=261.58s)]
*  But when Crivellari and her newborn daughter came home from the hospital, there were still mountains of bills to navigate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=266.82s)]
*  It really felt like a full time job some days getting the baby down to sleep and then getting on the phone and trying to, you know, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=272.42s)]
*  I'd set up one payment plan and then a new bill would come that afternoon. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=278.7s)]
*  Crivellari and her husband are both public school teachers in Illinois. Having a baby left them about $5,000 in debt. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=281.86s)]
*  New parents in the U.S. with private insurance on average face more than $3,000 in uncovered medical bills. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=289.3s)]
*  If there are complications, out of pocket costs can run several times that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=295.54s)]
*  That's Noam Levy with KFF Health News reporting. This is NPR. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zEAr7UFLHw&t=300.02s)]
