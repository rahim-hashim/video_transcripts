*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=11.64s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump held a meandering press conference yesterday at his Florida resort. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Tom Driesbach reports Trump reiterated his support for rioters charged in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=22.0s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly promised to pardon rioters charged for their role in the January 6th 2021 insurrection, including those convicted of assaulting police. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=29.68s)]
*  Speaking at Mar-a-Lago, he bragged about the size of the crowd that day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=38.88s)]
*  The biggest crowd I've ever spoken, I've spoken to the biggest crowds. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=42.24s)]
*  Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=45.16s)]
*  Trump then stated falsely that the January 6th crowd was larger than the peaceful civil rights protesters who attended Martin Luther King Jr.'s landmark I Have a Dream speech. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=47.08s)]

*  NPR's Jeff Brady reports Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed a climate law last year. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=71.56s)]
*  It requires all power plants to generate electricity from clean energy by 2040. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=76.92s)]
*  In signing the clean energy law, Walz echoed a Biden-Harris administration message on climate change. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=82.4s)]
*  Sustainability of the planet and our economic future are no longer divided. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=87.88s)]
*  They run hand in hand. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=91.56s)]
*  Antonio Ardiano with the youth voter group NextGen America says Walz was the first choice for many young people. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=92.88s)]
*  Walz administration has also funded clean energy career training to prepare Minnesotans for industries of the future and has advocated for expanding electric vehicles in the state. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=99.2s)]
*  Walz's Republican rival J.D. Vance echoed Trump campaign arguments critical of renewable energy and claimed boosting EVs will hurt the U.S. auto industry. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=110.80000000000001s)]

*  When Vice President Harris ran for president in 2019, she supported a ban on the oil and gas drilling technique known as fracking. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Harris' campaign says she no longer supports such a ban. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=129.88s)]

*  The lawsuit accuses Delta of refusing to refund passengers even though that's required by law. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=143.8s)]
*  From member station W.A.B.E. in Atlanta, Marlon Hyde reports Delta and the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike continue to trade blame for who's responsible. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=149.56s)]
*  The class action suit was filed on behalf of all Delta customers whose flights were canceled or significantly affected due to the outage. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=160.6s)]
*  The U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating why Delta took longer than other airlines to get back online. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=168.56s)]
*  This week, Microsoft joined CrowdStrike in pushing back against Delta, saying the airline's outdated system is to blame for its several thousand canceled flights. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Delta declined to comment, citing pending litigation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=184.48s)]

*  As NPR's Mandelie Del Barco reports, its roots are in New York. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=196.52s)]
*  Breaking was born in the South Bronx in the 1970s. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=201.4s)]
*  During hip hop house parties and street jams, black and Puerto Rican teens took turns showing off dance moves during breaks in the music. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=204.68s)]
*  B-boys and B-girls innovated fancy footwork with acrobatics, including spinning on their backs and heads. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  In the 1980s, the media dubbed it break dancing, and it showed up in movies, on TV, and even as part of the closing ceremony for the 1984 Olympics. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=220.12s)]
*  Dancer Ken Swift is a member of the hugely influential Rocksteady Crew. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  People didn't really understand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=234.08s)]
*  They thought it was just a lot of black and Latino kids with a lot of energy, but it stood the test of time. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  Swift says breaking is more of a global art form than a sport, but he says dancing at the Paris Olympics is another breakthrough. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=241.12s)]
*  Mandelie Del Barco, NPR News. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=247.88s)]
*  American sprinter Noah Lyles faltered during the 200-meter final yesterday at the Summer Olympic Games, taking the bronze medal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=250.16s)]
*  At the end of the race, Lyles collapsed on the ground. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=258.0s)]
*  He later confirmed he tested positive for COVID on Tuesday. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  NPR's Brian Mann has more. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  In front of a roaring crowd, Noah Lyles quickly fell behind Lucille de Bojo from Botswana and American Kenny Bidnarek. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=266.88s)]
*  The lightning speed Lyles often shows when finishing big races never materialized, and after crossing the finish line and taking bronze, he fell to the ground. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=273.6s)]
*  U.S. track and field confirmed in a statement Lyles tested positive two days ago for COVID, but he insisted on racing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=281.72s)]
*  Lyles was hoping to pair a 200-meter win with the gold medal in the 100-meter Olympic final that he won on Sunday. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=288.4s)]
*  It was not to be. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=294.8s)]
*  The U.S. did win three other gold medals on the night. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7HBi1QU4c&t=296.16s)]
