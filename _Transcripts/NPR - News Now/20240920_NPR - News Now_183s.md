# Harris Blasts Trump On Immigration In Event With Oprah | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, September 20th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump cast himself as Israel's protector during a speech to the Israeli-American Council in Washington, D.C. last evening. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=7.0s)]
*  NPR's Sarah McKammon reports Trump warned Jewish voters against supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=15.0s)]
*  Former President Trump addressed the summit during an evening focused on commemorating the October 7th attacks, which sparked Israel's war with Hamas. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=20.0s)]
*  Speaking to a mostly friendly crowd, Trump touted his past support for Israel and claimed that the Jewish state will soon cease to exist unless he's elected. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=29.0s)]
*  It's total annihilation. That's what you're talking about. You don't have a protector. You have a big protector in me. You don't have a protector on the other side. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=38.0s)]
*  Trump also accused Vice President Harris of pandering to Hamas supporters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=46.0s)]
*  Harris has said she will support Israel's right to defend itself while also calling the suffering in Gaza devastating. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=51.0s)]
*  Sarah McKammon, NPR News, Washington. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=57.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris held a virtual interview event last night where she answered questions from media mogul Oprah Winfrey. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=60.0s)]
*  Several hundred people attended the event near Detroit, Michigan. Hundreds of thousands of others watched online. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=66.0s)]
*  Harris got support from other celebrities virtually and she used the chance to criticize Donald Trump on issues. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=72.0s)]
*  Harris noted it was Trump who persuaded Republican senators to torpedo a bipartisan bill on immigration issues earlier this year. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=79.0s)]
*  Donald Trump called up those folks and said, don't put that bill on the floor for a vote. He blocked the bill. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=87.0s)]
*  You know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=96.0s)]
*  Today Harris will hold campaign rallies in Georgia and Wisconsin. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=102.0s)]

*  CNN reported the comments came from someone using his email address and personal information. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=117.0s)]
*  NPR has not independently verified the report. Robinson is the lieutenant governor. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=122.0s)]
*  A sheriff in southeastern Kentucky has been arrested after allegedly shooting and killing a district judge in his chambers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=128.0s)]
*  From member station WEKU, Stan Engold reports the incident happened yesterday. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=135.0s)]
*  Kentucky State Police received a 911 call around 3 p.m. of shots fired in the Letcher County Courthouse in the town of Weitzburg. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=141.0s)]
*  Law enforcement and first responders arrived to find district judge Kevin Mullins with multiple gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=148.0s)]
*  During a press conference, Kentucky State Police Trooper Matt Gayhart said an initial investigation indicates Letcher County Sheriff Mickey Steins shot Mullins following an argument inside the courthouse. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=155.0s)]
*  He was arrested on scene without incident shortly after officials arrived. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=165.0s)]
*  Steins has been transported to a correctional facility and has been charged with first degree murder. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=171.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Stan Engold in Richmond, Kentucky. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f-ibpd2LlE&t=175.0s)]
