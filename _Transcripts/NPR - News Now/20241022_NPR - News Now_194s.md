*  to all be Americans and put party aside. Harris has been emphasizing that one of the main differences [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=43.68s)]
*  between her and her opponent, former President Trump, is that she will uphold the Constitution, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=48.480000000000004s)]

*  on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania, where I was knocked to the ground, essentially, by what seemed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=87.2s)]
*  like a supernatural hand, and I would like to think that God saved me for a purpose, and that's to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=97.68s)]

*  said Robertson could testify remotely, but the lawmakers and Robertson's lawyers disagreed, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=131.36s)]
*  saying that he has autism and faces challenges communicating. The Texas newsroom's blaze [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=137.36s)]

*  do you believe Robert Robertson murdered his daughter Nikki? No. How strongly do you feel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=176.48s)]
*  about that? 100%. The impact of the hearing on Robertson's fate remains uncertain. I'm Blaze [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=182.8s)]
*  Ganey in Austin. This is NPR. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXJwkEpX10&t=188.88s)]
