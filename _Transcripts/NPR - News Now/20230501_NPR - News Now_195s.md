*  selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=4.8s)]
*  And Russian missile strikes injured 25 people in central Ukraine overnight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=7.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=12.72s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=13.72s)]
*  A third bank has failed this year in the U.S. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=17.64s)]
*  Federal regulators acted to save the collapsing First Republic Bank over the weekend. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=20.7s)]
*  They sold it to global bank JPMorgan Chase. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=25.36s)]
*  First Republic's troubles surfaced after two other banks in the U.S. with similar problems [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=28.52s)]
*  were taken over in March. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=32.88s)]
*  These problems got worse last week. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=35.04s)]
*  Brookings Institution senior fellow David Wessel says people who have money in the bank [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  now have been protected. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=41.72s)]
*  A lot of First Republic's deposits have already taken their money elsewhere, but there's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=43.68s)]
*  90 billion dollars still there and that money is safe. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=47.92s)]
*  They're now deposits at JPMorgan Chase. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=50.68s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's Morning Edition. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  But unlike depositors at First Republic, the bank's investors are not protected and will [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=55.24s)]
*  lose their investments. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=60.32s)]
*  Russian missile attacks overnight injured 25 people in central Ukraine and damaged an [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=62.68s)]

*  Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine ahead of a planned Ukrainian counteroffensive to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=73.6s)]
*  push out Russian forces. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=78.28s)]
*  Ukrainian air defenses shot down 15 of the 18 Russian missiles aimed at the capital, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=80.92s)]
*  Kyiv, and other Ukrainian cities. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=86.08s)]
*  But at least two hit an industrial facility in the central city of Pavlohrad, sparking [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=88.44s)]
*  a large, powerful fire there, according to Serhii Lusak, the head of the local military [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=93.28s)]
*  administration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=98.44s)]
*  The blast injured 25 people, including three children. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=99.66s)]
*  A Russian installed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region wrote on Telegram that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=103.4s)]

*  The attack comes after a Ukrainian drone hit an oil storage facility in Crimea, which Russia [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=113.92s)]
*  occupied in 2014. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=119.28s)]

*  15,000 migrants crossed over into the U.S. into the border town. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=138.32s)]
*  Gloria Chavez is a Border Patrol agent for the area. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=143.44s)]
*  And we start noticing the majority of that uptake is related to Venezuela nationals, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=147.0s)]
*  many of them, as you know, who have been waiting south of the river in encampments there in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=151.24s)]
*  that location. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=155.52s)]

*  The influx comes before the end of Title 42 on May 11th, which allows the U.S. to immediately [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10wVF2URZRo&t=161.96s)]
