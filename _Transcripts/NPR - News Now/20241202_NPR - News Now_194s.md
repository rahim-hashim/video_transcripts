# Biden Signs A Sweeping Pardon For His Son, Hunter | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU)
*  President Biden has signed a quote, full and unconditional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=0.0s)]
*  pardon for his son Hunter and several international aid [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=4.48s)]
*  organizations have been forced to pause their work in Gaza, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=8.2s)]
*  even as many Palestinians are starving there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=15.52s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=16.2s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  President Biden has signed a sweeping pardon [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=20.92s)]
*  for his son Hunter Biden, who had been convicted [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=24.04s)]
*  of federal tax and gun charges. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=27.12s)]
*  The full and unconditional pardon [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=29.8s)]
*  is aimed at protecting the president's son [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=32.04s)]
*  from future prosecution from the incoming Trump administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=34.68s)]
*  NPR's Mara Eliason reports Biden's decision [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=39.0s)]
*  may tarnish his reputation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=42.2s)]
*  I think this will affect his legacy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=44.84s)]
*  And there are a lot of Democrats saying, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=46.8s)]
*  how can Democrats accuse Trump of being above the law [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=48.68s)]
*  when he pardons, for instance, violent January 6 defendants? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=52.2s)]
*  If in fact, that's what he does, he [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=57.2s)]
*  said he wants to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=59.04s)]
*  They think that maybe Democrats have [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=60.12s)]
*  seeded the moral high ground. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=62.1s)]
*  So this is very controversial inside the president's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=63.6s)]
*  own party. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=66.76s)]
*  But it was a very, very personal decision. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=67.72s)]
*  That's NPR's Mara Eliason reporting. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=70.52s)]
*  President Biden will travel to Africa today, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=73.44s)]
*  his first trip to the continent since taking office. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Emmanuel Akinwatu reports from Lagos. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=80.44s)]
*  Biden's visit is only the second trip to Africa [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=84.24s)]
*  by a US president in a decade and is likely the president's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=86.64s)]
*  last foreign trip, two months before he leaves office. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=90.2s)]
*  The trip concludes efforts by the Biden administration [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=93.84s)]
*  to improve its ties in Africa and to counter [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=96.76s)]
*  the growing influence of China and Russia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=99.2s)]
*  In Angola, Biden will visit a US-financed rail project [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=102.12s)]
*  called the Lobito Corridor. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=105.76s)]
*  The 1,300-kilometer freight rail line [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=107.6s)]
*  runs through mineral-rich Central African countries [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  like the Democratic Republic of Congo [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=112.72s)]
*  and connects to Zambia and Tanzania. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=115.0s)]
*  It's designed to ease the export of minerals [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=117.92s)]
*  like cobalt and copper that the US and other countries want [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=120.16s)]
*  access to. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=123.52s)]
*  Emmanuel Akinwatu, NPR News, Lagos. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=124.44s)]
*  Several international aid organizations [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=127.8s)]
*  have been forced to pause services in Gaza. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=130.52s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports people there [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=133.88s)]
*  are desperate for food more than a year [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=136.8s)]
*  after the war broke out between Israel and Hamas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=139.76s)]
*  The UN announced yesterday its pausing aid deliveries [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=143.8s)]
*  into Gaza, saying armed gangs inside [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=146.44s)]
*  have made it too dangerous. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=148.84s)]
*  World Central Kitchen has also suspended operations [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=150.4s)]
*  after several of its members were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=153.24s)]
*  killed by an Israeli strike. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel says one of them was Hamas. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=156.4s)]
*  And the World Food Program has suspended delivery [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  of food parcels, saying that there are no supplies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, Palestinians are starving. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=163.72000000000003s)]
*  NPR's producer in Gaza, Anas Baba, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=166.52s)]
*  visited the sole operating charity kitchen in Khan Yunis, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=168.28s)]
*  where thousands clamored for a simple meal of beans. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=171.12s)]
*  They are just pushing each other. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  They just keep pushing forward and forward and forward. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=176.36s)]
*  We saw a child that he's fainted from all of the squeezing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  He says the food ran out, and many, including children, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=183.56s)]
*  left without. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Kat Lonsdorf, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTC4SmMLHBU&t=188.16000000000003s)]
