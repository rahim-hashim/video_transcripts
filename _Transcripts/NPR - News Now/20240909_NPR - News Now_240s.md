*  Kentucky State Police will resume their manhunt this morning for a shooting suspect in the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=16.76s)]
*  southeast part of the state. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=20.52s)]
*  On Saturday, an armed man opened fire on motorists on Interstate 75. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=22.36s)]
*  A dozen vehicles were hit and five people injured. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=26.84s)]
*  Remember Station WUKY, Josh James reports. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=30.04s)]

*  about 80 miles south of Lexington. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=38.84s)]
*  The shooting set off a police search through a remote wooded region while motorists were [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=41.2s)]
*  stranded during an hours-long shutdown of portions of Interstate 75 and residents were [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=44.96s)]

*  it was not a case of road rage. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=63.8s)]

*  civil rights and misleading superiors about their actions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=84.04s)]
*  Body camera and surveillance footage captured a total of five officers kicking, striking, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=88.12s)]
*  and punching Nichols after an alleged traffic stop in January of last year. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  The 29-year-old died in the hospital three days later. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=97.38000000000001s)]

*  The trial for the three other defendants who maintain their innocence is expected to last [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=112.0s)]
*  several weeks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=116.28s)]
*  They also face separate charges in state court, including second-degree murder. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=117.56s)]

*  In Venezuela, the opposition presidential candidate who's widely thought to have won the country's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=124.42s)]
*  presidential election this summer has taken political asylum in Spain. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=129.28s)]
*  Edmundo González was facing arrest for defying Venezuelan authorities. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=133.88s)]
*  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who controls all the levers of government, has been cracking [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=138.28s)]
*  down on the opposition. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=143.2s)]
*  NPR's John Otis says it's not clear how effective González will be in exile. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=144.68s)]
*  González joins an ever-expanding group of exiled Venezuelans who've gone to Spain. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=149.56s)]
*  That includes four previous presidential hopefuls. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=155.76s)]
*  But once politicians leave, it usually means that they're gone for good. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=159.04s)]
*  It's starting to resemble Cuba's exile community that's based in Miami but has really very [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=163.08s)]
*  little political influence on the island. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=168.96s)]
*  So in the end, the Maduro regime, it may be that they're quite pleased that González is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  no longer inside of Venezuela. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=175.64000000000001s)]

*  Typhoon Yagi, now a tropical depression, left a swath of destruction across East and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=189.16s)]
*  Southeast Asia over the weekend. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=194.07999999999998s)]

*  And BIRS Emily Feng has more. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=201.48s)]
*  Yagi brought high winds of more than 120 miles an hour and heavy rains to China's island [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=203.4s)]
*  province of Hainan over the weekend. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=208.92s)]
*  The province's meteorological bureau said the storm was quote, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=211.48s)]

*  Typhoon Yagi first hit the Philippines last week, killing at least 20 people there before [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=226.48s)]
*  making landfall in southern China and then Vietnam. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRV49HvLJ5w&t=230.89999999999998s)]
