*  The fear is palpable, says Scott Anderson, who's based in Ra'afah with UNRWA, the UN agency that aids Palestinians. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA1fpiiTKjg&t=39.72s)]
*  People are very nervous. They don't want to get caught up in this conflict. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA1fpiiTKjg&t=47.84s)]
*  I mean, the scale of death and injuries has already been horrific, and they just want to protect their families. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA1fpiiTKjg&t=52.52s)]

*  The president is trying to strike a balance between free speech and lawlessness, saying there is a right to protest, but not a right to cause chaos. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA1fpiiTKjg&t=99.03999999999999s)]
