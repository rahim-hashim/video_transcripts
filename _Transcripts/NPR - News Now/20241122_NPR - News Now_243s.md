# UNICEF: Israel Targeted Schools In Gaza Dozens Of Times Last Month | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, November 22nd. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=3.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump will nominate former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=7.0s)]
*  to be U.S. Attorney General. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=11.0s)]
*  This comes after former Congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=13.0s)]
*  He had been investigated on sexual misconduct allegations that he denies. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=16.0s)]
*  Trump has been moving quickly to name people for his incoming administration, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=20.0s)]
*  but NPR's Tamara Keith reports he's been slow to deal with other aspects [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=24.0s)]
*  of his presidential transition. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=28.0s)]
*  The Trump transition has failed to sign at least three required formal agreements [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=30.0s)]
*  with the Biden administration, needed to gain access to agencies and classified briefings. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=34.0s)]
*  It's incredibly important for national security purposes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=39.0s)]
*  Danielle Caputo is legal counsel for ethics at the Campaign Legal Center. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=42.0s)]
*  Instead, they're going to be spending the initial periods in the administration [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=47.0s)]
*  trying to play catch-up on a lot of information that they didn't have access to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=52.0s)]
*  because they failed to sign these memorandas. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=56.0s)]
*  The Trump transition team says it is still constructively engaged [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=59.0s)]
*  with the Biden administration about the documents, but no decision has been made. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=63.0s)]

*  in Gaza 64 times last month. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=75.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says the schools are being used by Hamas, the group Israel is battling. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=78.0s)]
*  NPR's Eya Batraoui reports. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=83.0s)]
*  UNICEF in a statement said the attacks on schools in October killed around 130 people, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=85.0s)]
*  many of them children. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=90.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, NPR producer Anas Babah went to a school in central Gaza [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=94.0s)]
*  that had just been bombed by an Israeli fighter jet [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=98.0s)]
*  and saw children's body parts strewn in the aftermath. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=101.0s)]

*  and bombed the hospital's generator, forcing nurses to pump oxygen manually to a baby in an incubator. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=115.0s)]
*  Six people were wounded, including a doctor now in critical condition. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=121.0s)]
*  Gaza's health ministry says more than 2,000 people have been killed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=125.0s)]

*  Israel says it's targeting Hamas militants trying to regroup. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=131.0s)]
*  Eya Batraoui, NPR News. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=134.0s)]
*  Big tech company Google is calling the Justice Department's push [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=136.0s)]

*  NPR's Bobby Allen reports justice lawyers are asking a federal court [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=142.0s)]
*  to force Google to sell its popular web browser, Chrome. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=146.0s)]
*  After being declared an illegal monopoly earlier this year, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=150.0s)]
*  the Justice Department is pushing for drastic changes at Google. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=152.0s)]
*  Among them, sell off the popular Chrome browser to another company. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=155.0s)]
*  George Hayes, a former Justice Department lawyer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=159.0s)]
*  It will be one of the few divestitures that have occurred in antitrust cases. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=161.0s)]
*  It seems to fit a supposed crime. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=165.0s)]
*  It does seem as though this may be necessary to introduce effective competition search. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=167.0s)]
*  Google says the proposals represent unprecedented government overreach [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=172.0s)]

*  according to TSA Administrator David Pekoski. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=201.0s)]
*  This will be the busiest Thanksgiving ever in terms of air travel. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=204.0s)]
*  This year has already been the busiest in TSA history. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=208.0s)]

*  The busiest days next week are likely to be Tuesday, Wednesday, and especially Sunday, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=217.0s)]
*  when more than 3 million people are expected to pass through TSA checkpoints. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqA0dCwGHck&t=221.0s)]
