# Trump, Musk Leave Lawmakers Scrambling To Avert Shutdown | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU)
*  Lawmakers are scrambling to avert a partial federal government shutdown that's set to begin tomorrow night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=0.0s)]
*  And a French court has convicted about 50 men of raping a woman over the course of a decade. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=6.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=11.5s)]
*  Congress has until tomorrow night to approve a short-term spending bill to avert a partial shutdown of the federal government. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=16.5s)]
*  House Republicans have rejected a spending bill that had won bipartisan support this week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=22.5s)]
*  But NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports President-elect Trump demanded that GOP lawmakers abandon it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=27.5s)]
*  After intense pressure from billionaire adviser Elon Musk, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance are calling on Republicans to reject the bill. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=33.5s)]
*  The short-term measure includes over $100 billion towards disaster aid and farm subsidies, among other things. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=41.5s)]
*  In a statement, Trump and Vance called for a bill they say doesn't include any legislative wins for Democrats. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=48.0s)]
*  This leaves Republicans scrambling to keep the government open right as Congress is also prepping to go home for the holidays. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=53.5s)]
*  Barbara Sprunt and P.R. News, the Capitol. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=60.0s)]
*  Members of the Conservative Freedom Caucus have expressed frustration with House Speaker Mike Johnson's management of the bill. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=62.0s)]
*  Caucus Chair, Maryland GOP Congressman Andy Harris, spoke to MSNBC. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I'm only one vote out of 220. Look, I think the Speaker could have handled this differently at this point. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=74.5s)]
*  I'm still supportive of the Speaker, but I will tell you that voices both inside the House Freedom Caucus and outside the Freedom Caucus have been very disappointed at what's happened this week. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=80.5s)]
*  The failed government spending bill was supposed to provide disaster relief to many states suffering from hurricane damage this year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=90.5s)]
*  Workers at seven Amazon facilities have gone on strike this morning. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=97.5s)]
*  The Teamsters Union says they're demanding that the online retailer come to the bargaining table and hash out contracts. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=102.5s)]
*  They're on picket lines from New York to Los Angeles. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=109.0s)]
*  Amazon has released a statement saying the Teamsters Union does not represent its workers and that the union is pushing a false narrative. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=112.0s)]
*  The strikes come less than a week before Christmas and Hanukkah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=119.0s)]
*  A court in France has convicted nearly 50 men for rape. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=123.0s)]
*  A man drugged his then-wife and then invited strangers to rape her while she was unconscious. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=128.0s)]

*  She has been in the French courtroom for weeks demanding justice. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=146.0s)]
*  After the verdicts today, she spoke publicly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=150.0s)]
*  Speaking in French, Pellicot said that this had been a difficult trial and that she was thinking of her children and her grandchildren. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=158.0s)]
*  Pellicot also called for a better future where women and men can live together in mutual respect. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=165.0s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron is on the French territorial island of Maït. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=171.0s)]

*  The UN migration agency says 100,000 refugees have returned to Syria from neighboring countries that since rebel groups overthrew Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=193.0s)]
*  And Piers Fatma Tanis reports from Istanbul. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=203.0s)]
*  Half of Syria's population was displaced from their homes during 14 years of civil war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=206.0s)]
*  Millions of them became refugees abroad and now many want to return home. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=212.0s)]
*  The International Organization for Migration estimates that one million people will return to Syria between January and June of 2025. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=218.0s)]
*  Most of the 100,000 who already returned home came from neighboring Lebanon. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=227.0s)]
*  Some 7,000 refugees have also returned from Turkey, which hosts the largest number of Syrians in the world, more than three million. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=233.0s)]
*  But the UN agency also urged caution over a sudden large-scale return of refugees, saying the system in Syria is fragile and won't bear the influx. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=242.0s)]

*  In a little more than a week, researchers on the US East Coast have discovered three right whales that are entangled. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=255.0s)]
*  Right whales are critically endangered. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=262.0s)]
*  For member station WCAI, Eve Zukoff reports there are fewer than 400 of them left. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=265.0s)]
*  The first whale, an adult female, was seen off the coast of Massachusetts with ropes trailing from her mouth halfway down her body. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=271.0s)]

*  The harder we work at finding whales, the more we're going to discover. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=298.0s)]
*  Landry says a national disentanglement network is ready to free the whales if they're seen again and weather permits. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=302.0s)]

*  Researchers who checked it out then discovered an entire mastodon jawbone. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=339.0s)]
*  They say now they're looking for more. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPpz02Z8kU&t=343.0s)]
