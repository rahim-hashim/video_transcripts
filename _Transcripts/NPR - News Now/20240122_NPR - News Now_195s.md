# DeSantis Out, Leaving N.H. Race Down To Trump, Haley | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE)
*  With Ron DeSantis out of the presidential race, Nikki Haley and Donald Trump will face off in New Hampshire's primary election tomorrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=0.0s)]
*  And two Navy SEALs missing for more than a week in the Red Sea are now presumed dead. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=7.2s)]
*  Good morning. Ancora Va-Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=12.4s)]
*  There's one day to go before the New Hampshire presidential primary. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=16.9s)]
*  Now it's a two-person race. Following Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' announcement yesterday, he'd suspend his presidential campaign. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=20.1s)]
*  From member station WBUR, Anthony Brooks reports DeSantis' decision could help former President Donald Trump fend off a challenge from former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  DeSantis promised Trump-like policies but without the drama. But now he's out of the race and has endorsed Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=37.8s)]
*  Polls show that a majority of his New Hampshire supporters say Trump is their second choice. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=43.8s)]
*  So this could narrow the path for Nikki Haley, who badly needs a victory in New Hampshire. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=48.8s)]
*  She's counting on the state's many moderate independents who can pull either a Democratic or a Republican ballot. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=53.7s)]
*  Voters like Carol DeHaven of Hollis, who says she's voting for Haley in the primary because Trump is a threat to democracy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=59.900000000000006s)]
*  I like her policies. I like what she stands for. And she is not Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=67.10000000000001s)]
*  However, just like my husband, if it's between Trump and Biden, I will definitely vote for Biden. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  Trump and Haley are making their final pitches to New Hampshire voters on Monday. For NPR News, I'm Anthony Brooks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=75.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump could testify today in his New York defamation trial. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=81.7s)]
*  Writer E. Jean Carroll says Trump defamed her by calling her a liar. That was after, she said, he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=85.7s)]
*  Last year, a jury found Trump liable for sexual assault and defamation against Carroll. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=94.5s)]
*  This new jury is determining whether Trump should pay damages for more defamatory statements. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=99.2s)]
*  And Piers Andrea Bernstein says the only thing at issue is how much. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=104.7s)]
*  The jury could order Trump to pay compensatory damages for the two statements he made while president. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=108.7s)]
*  But and the judge has already pointed this out to the jury, they can determine punitive damages based on how much money it could take to get Trump to stop. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=113.5s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Bernstein reporting. Winter storms are still pounding the central plains and Midwest this morning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  The Associated Press says at least 72 people have died in the U.S. this month in weather related incidents. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=129.0s)]
*  The U.S. military says that two Navy SEALs missing off the coast of Somalia are presumed dead. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=136.2s)]
*  As NPR's Emma Bowman reports, crews had searched for the two SEALs for more than a week. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=142.5s)]
*  The SEALs were reported missing after a January 11th raid of an Iranian ship, which U.S. defense officials said was carrying ballistic and cruise missiles headed for Houthi fighters in Yemen. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=148.2s)]
*  During the raid, one Navy SEAL fell into the rough waters. A second followed the SEAL to save him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  In a statement on Sunday, U.S. Central Command said that it ended the 10-day search after covering more than 21,000 square miles. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=165.5s)]
*  The Houthis have attacked commercial ships off the coast of Yemen in the Red Sea for weeks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=173.8s)]
*  The U.S. has responded with airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=178.8s)]
*  The Houthis say their attacks are a show of support for Palestinians facing Israeli attacks in Gaza. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=183.5s)]
*  Emma Bowman, NPR News. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=189.8s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaLhgJXnxE&t=191.8s)]
