# N.Y.'s National Guard Now Patrolling NYC's Subways | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE)
*  President Biden delivers his State of the Union address tonight, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=0.0s)]
*  and 750 National Guard members are being dispatched to patrol New York City subways [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=3.24s)]
*  after a string of violent crimes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=8.4s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=10.74s)]
*  President Biden delivers his State of the Union address tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Tamara Keith reports, in many ways, this is the kickoff the 2024 general election. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=17.88s)]
*  With former President Trump now the presumptive Republican nominee, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=23.68s)]
*  President Biden's State of the Union address comes at a moment when the public is beginning to focus [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=27.96s)]
*  on what is shaping up to be a campaign rematch. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Democratic political consultant Faz Shakir says President Biden hasn't yet clearly outlined his second term agenda, but [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=36.96s)]
*  To defend the president, he hasn't yet delivered the State of the Union, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  which I think marks the point in time that gives you this opportunity to say, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  If you put me back in office, there's work that I'm doing that is not yet done. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=54.94s)]
*  Biden is set to hit the road for campaign events starting on Friday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=59.9s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=64.1s)]
*  A new poll shows a majority of American voters support protecting access to abortion [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=65.84s)]
*  for people experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies such as miscarriages. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=70.58s)]
*  NPR's Maria Godoy reports that's one of the findings of a survey from the health research organization KFF. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=75.22s)]
*  The new poll also found widespread support across party lines for allowing women to travel for medical care, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=81.74s)]
*  including getting an abortion. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=87.88s)]
*  In addition, a majority of people said they don't want doctors who perform abortions [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=89.78s)]
*  or women who have them to face criminal charges. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=94.62s)]
*  Here's KFF pollster Ashley Kritzinger. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=98.42s)]
*  So we see eight and 10 Democrats, two-thirds of independents and about half of Republicans [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=101.02s)]
*  who want to protect doctors who perform abortions from facing either fines or prison time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  That includes protecting health care providers from being prosecuted for mailing abortion pills [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=112.88s)]
*  to patients in states where abortion is banned. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=118.16s)]
*  Maria Godoy, NPR News. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=121.56s)]
*  Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has signed a new law that provides legal immunity to providers [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  who offer in vitro fertilization. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=128.9s)]
*  Many Alabama providers stopped offering it after the Alabama Supreme Court's opinion [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=131.24s)]
*  that said frozen embryos are considered children. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=136.26000000000002s)]
*  IVF clinics discard unviable and leftover embryos. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=139.4s)]
*  It was not clear if the Alabama clinics could be charged with manslaughter or homicide. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=143.56s)]
*  New York Governor Kathy Hochul is sending more than 700 National Guard members [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  to help patrol New York City subways. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=153.34s)]
*  This comes after some well-publicized reports of violent crimes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=155.9s)]
*  Hochul says the Guard members will help search passengers' bags for weapons. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=159.94s)]
*  Anyone looking to do harm or spread fear on our subways, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=164.5s)]
*  you will be caught. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  Plain and simple. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=172.1s)]
*  There will be consequences. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  This has to end. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=175.04s)]
*  New Yorkers deserve no less. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=176.66s)]
*  Overall, crime has dropped in New York City in recent years. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=178.22s)]
*  There have been fewer reported killings on the subway system, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=181.94s)]
*  but the recent cases have put subway passengers on edge. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  The Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to eat [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=188.98s)]
*  ground cinnamon sold at some discount retailers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=192.96s)]
*  The FDA says that's because there's lead in the cinnamon [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=196.44s)]
*  that may be at unsafe levels. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=199.48s)]
*  Some of the stores selling the ground cinnamon are Family Dollar, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=201.72s)]
*  Dollar Tree, and Save-A-Lot. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  The FDA says just throw away the products. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=207.62s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman, NPR News in Washington. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJVjSmaBEE&t=211.04s)]
