# Biden Works To Shore Up Support From Latino Voters | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA)
*  Live from NPR News, I'm Korva Coleman. President Biden and former President Donald Trump won several presidential primaries yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=0.0s)]
*  These were in Arizona, Kansas, Illinois, Ohio and Florida. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=7.0s)]
*  Trump is a Florida resident. Yesterday he revealed for whom he cast his presidential primary ballot. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=10.5s)]
*  I voted for Donald Trump. Did somebody just say who did you vote for? Yeah, I voted for Donald Trump. Thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=15.5s)]
*  Democrats in Florida did not hold a primary. Officials opted to award the state's Democratic delegates to President Biden. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=22.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden is trying to shore up support from Latino voters. In Arizona yesterday, he launched Latinos Con Biden Harris. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=28.5s)]
*  This is a campaign program meant to court Latino support. NPR's Deepa Sivaram is traveling with the president. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=35.5s)]
*  Biden rallied with Latino supporters at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix on Tuesday. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=41.5s)]
*  He talked about his administration's investments in Latino small businesses and Hispanic serving institutions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=46.5s)]
*  But he was also quick to call out former President Trump and his rhetoric talking about immigrants. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=52.5s)]
*  This election is not a referendum on me. It's an election between me and a guy named Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=57.5s)]
*  This week, the campaign also released an ad targeting Latino voters. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=64.5s)]
*  The video highlights Biden's efforts to cut the cost of insulin and his support for reproductive rights. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=68.5s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News, Phoenix. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=73.5s)]
*  A federal appeals court has again put on hold a controversial Texas immigration law. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=76.5s)]
*  It allows local police, rather than only federal officers, to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing into the U.S. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=81.5s)]
*  The migrants could be deported to Mexico. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=88.5s)]
*  The appeals court block came hours after the U.S. Supreme Court had allowed the law to go forward. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=91.5s)]
*  But due to complex legal procedures, the lower appeals court blocked the Texas law, and we'll hear some arguments in the case this morning. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=97.5s)]
*  The United Kingdom says its largest ever shipment of food aid to Gaza crossed into the territory overnight. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=105.5s)]
*  The delivery comes amid warnings that famine is imminent. NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from London. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=111.5s)]
*  The U.K.'s Foreign Office says this shipment includes fortified wheat flour for Gaza's bakeries, hot meals, and food parcels that consist of canned vegetables, meat, fish, and date bars. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=117.5s)]
*  Altogether, it's more than 2,000 tons of food, enough to feed more than 275,000 people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=129.5s)]
*  It crossed into Gaza by land with help from Jordan, the Foreign Office says, and it's being distributed on the ground by the World Food Program. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=135.5s)]
*  This is in addition to a U.K. delivery last week that included 150 tons of blankets and tents, as well as a U.K. field hospital, which is now up and running inside the territory. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=143.5s)]
*  Like the U.S., the U.K. sells weapons to Israel, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza. Lauren Freyer, NPR News, London. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=154.5s)]
*  Heavy fighting is still reported at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=162.5s)]
*  The Israeli military says that it has killed dozens of Palestinian fighters there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=167.5s)]
*  However, it is not clear that all of the dead were combatants. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=172.5s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H--ExXmOMDA&t=177.5s)]
