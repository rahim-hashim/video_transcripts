*  over Canada have angered Canadian voters. In a somewhat surprising move, the Trump administration [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJ8ZPj0xpo&t=25.6s)]
*  has asked a federal court to dismiss a case that could seriously limit access to abortion across [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJ8ZPj0xpo&t=31.44s)]
*  the country. At beer, Selena Simmons Duffin reports the action continues a case that the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJ8ZPj0xpo&t=36.400000000000006s)]

*  had backup communication devices. But now Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer wants an investigation [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJ8ZPj0xpo&t=211.92000000000002s)]
