*  A congressional report out this morning finds new evidence that China is subsidizing the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=0.0s)]
*  production of fentanyl. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=4.5600000000000005s)]

*  Ukraine and Taiwan. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=20.0s)]
*  The Senate passed one big aid bill earlier this year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=21.46s)]
*  Johnson wants to divide that up into separate votes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  He's seeking to please some Republican factions that oppose aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=27.92s)]
*  There's new evidence this morning China is subsidizing companies that make the chemicals [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  used to produce the deadly street drug fentanyl. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=36.68s)]
*  A report released this morning by a House committee says Chinese officials continued [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  giving tax breaks and grants to the companies as fentanyl deaths soared in the U.S. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=44.44s)]
*  NPR's Brian Mann reports. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=50.24s)]
*  Drug policy experts widely agree the fentanyl killing tens of thousands of Americans each [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=52.24s)]
*  year is sourced originally from firms in China. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=56.42s)]
*  They sell so-called precursor chemicals to Mexican cartels. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=59.5s)]
*  Critics have long said China isn't doing enough to shut down those firms. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=63.34s)]
*  Now an investigation by a House committee found documents showing China appears to be [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=67.18s)]
*  indirectly subsidizing fentanyl production, offering tax rebates, grants and other incentives [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=71.58s)]
*  to firms exporting black market fentanyl chemicals to Mexico. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=77.26s)]
*  Last November, the Biden administration said China promised to help curb the fentanyl trade. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=81.22s)]
*  This report found no evidence that's happened. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=86.06s)]
*  Fentanyl is now a leading cause of death for people in the United States under the age [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=88.74000000000001s)]

*  Jury selection continues today in the New York criminal trial of former President Donald [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=94.9s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Trump has disparaged the judge, the district attorney and others. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  He continues to insist he is experiencing political interference. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=104.26s)]
*  Because he has to appear at the trial, Trump cannot get out on the campaign trail. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=108.2s)]
*  I'm not in Georgia or Florida or North Carolina campaigning like I should be. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=112.42s)]
*  Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal an affair ahead of the 2016 election. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  He has denied both the fraud and the allegations of the affair. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=124.82000000000001s)]

*  and warm temperatures. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=134.06s)]
*  As NPR's Kirk Siegler tells us, tens of thousands of customers in Colorado are bracing for more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=135.98s)]
*  power outages across the state. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=141.62s)]
*  The strong winds are forecast in the heavily populated foothills west of Denver, where [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  the weather has been seesawing lately between snow and record warm temperatures and low [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=148.62s)]
*  humidity. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=153.02s)]
*  That's typical for spring in eastern Colorado, though it seems to be happening even earlier [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=154.02s)]
*  in the season these days, if you can even call it a fire season due to climate change. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=157.9s)]
*  With another round of red flag warnings for extreme fire danger, all eyes are on Xcel [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  energy and whether the utility will preemptively shut off power. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=167.78s)]
*  State utility regulators are investigating Xcel's decision last week to preemptively [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=171.58s)]
*  shut off power ahead of another windstorm that damaged its power lines and whether the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=175.74s)]
*  company adequately communicated its plans to its customers, particularly businesses [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=180.1s)]
*  like restaurants and senior centers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZo3EKrI7o&t=184.38s)]
