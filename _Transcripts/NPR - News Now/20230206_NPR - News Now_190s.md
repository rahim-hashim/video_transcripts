# Earthquakes Devastate Turkey, Syria; Fighting Continues For Bakhmut, Ukraine | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc)
*  A series of devastating earthquakes has killed at least 1,300 people in Turkey and Syria. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=0.0s)]
*  And thousands of people are evacuating in eastern Ohio because of a fiery train derailment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=5.36s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  A catastrophic earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 hit southern Turkey and northern Syria overnight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=15.68s)]
*  It has been followed by aftershocks, one almost as powerful as the main tremor. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=21.92s)]
*  More than 1,300 people have been killed in both countries. The death toll continues to soar. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=26.64s)]
*  NPR's Ruth Sherlock says that is because the reach of the quakes' damage in Turkey is colossal. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=32.32s)]
*  So the epicenter of this earthquake was just north of Gaziantep, that's a provincial capital [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=37.92s)]
*  in Turkey with a population of about 2 million people. And the earthquake was so strong that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=43.2s)]
*  there are reports of buildings collapsed in an area that spans 200 miles around the epicenter. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  NPR's Ruth Sherlock reporting. The tremors have been felt as far away as Lebanon and even the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=54.64s)]
*  island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Making matters worse is that there is a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  snowstorm in the area. People forced out of their homes may have no shelter. Standing mosques have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=65.68s)]
*  opened to take people in. More fierce fighting is reported in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakmut, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=71.68s)]
*  where Ukrainian forces have been holding out against a Russian offensive. From Moscow, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=77.76s)]
*  NPR's Charles Maines has details. The head of the Russian mercenary force, the Wagner Group, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=82.72s)]
*  Yevgeny Prugoshin, said battles were going on for every street, every house and every stairwell in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=87.84s)]
*  Bakmut, a city that Russia sees as central to efforts to reestablish control over Ukraine's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  wider Donbas region. Russian armed forces, backed by Wagner fighters, many of them convicts, have [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=97.84s)]
*  been attempting to encircle Bakmut for weeks. Both Kiev and Moscow claim the other has suffered [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=103.52s)]
*  significant losses in the fight for the city, and outside observers point to evidence Russia [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=108.32s)]
*  now has the upper hand. Yet, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to defend the city, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  whose survival has become a cause celebre in Ukraine. Charles Maines, NPR News, Moscow. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  In the U.S., some limited evacuations are taking place in eastern Ohio. That's because of a fiery [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  freight train derailment. As NPR's Marie Andrusovitch reports, the freight rail train left the tracks [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=130.72s)]
*  last Friday. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine issued an evacuation notice for residents within a mile of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=137.44s)]
*  the site of a still-burning 50-car train derailment. This comes after officials reported a drastic [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=143.12s)]
*  temperature change in one of the cars that could lead to a major explosion. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabik. This catastrophic failure will, if it occurs, it will [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=154.16s)]
*  produce hydrogen chloride and phosgene gas into the atmosphere. We are working with several federal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=161.52s)]
*  agencies to determine a plume cloud for that. Safety teams are working to prevent the explosion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=167.04s)]
*  that officials say would project deadly shrapnel as far as a mile. Law enforcement officers are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=171.84s)]
*  trying to evacuate any residents that remain. Meanwhile, Governor DeWine has activated the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=177.6s)]
*  National Guard. Marie Andrusovitch, NPR News. This is NPR. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6W_QtbxOdc&t=182.16s)]
