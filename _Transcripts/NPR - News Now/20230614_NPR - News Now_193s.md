# Trump Defiant After Appearing In Federal Court | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4)
*  Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty yesterday to the 37 criminal charges that he's facing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal judge has temporarily blocked Microsoft's acquisition of a video game giant. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=12.0s)]
*  After former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to federal charges in Miami yesterday, he flew to Bedminster, New Jersey. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=16.0s)]
*  That's home to his summer residence and golf course. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=23.0s)]
*  Harrison Malkin reports Trump spoke defiantly about the charges to supporters at a campaign rally. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=25.0s)]
*  Trump spoke to a crowd of supporters and donors hours after being arraigned. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=31.0s)]
*  Among them was Adam W.A. Solis, co-chair of the New York Young Republicans Hispanic Caucus. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=36.0s)]
*  I understand his candor. I understand his pride. I myself hold the same pride of being a New Yorker. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=43.0s)]
*  Solis and other supporters echo Trump's rhetoric about this being a political lynching. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=49.0s)]
*  But the former president faces 37 federal felony charges related to the mishandling of classified documents. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=54.0s)]
*  Trump fought back on Tuesday night, calling the DOJ the Department of Injustice. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=62.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Harrison Malkin in Bedminster, New Jersey. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=68.0s)]
*  A federal judge is allowing writer E. Jean Carroll to seek another $10 million in damages against Trump. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=72.0s)]
*  Last month, a jury found Trump liable of sexual abuse and defamation against Carroll, but did not sustain her claim that Trump raped her. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=80.0s)]
*  Carroll's pending suit alleges Trump continued to disparage her. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=88.0s)]
*  A federal judge has temporarily blocked Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of video game giant Activision Blizzard. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=93.0s)]
*  As NPR's Bobby Allen reports, federal regulators have argued the deal would give Microsoft too much power in the gaming industry. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=101.0s)]
*  Microsoft's bid to take over Activision Blizzard would be the biggest merger in video game history. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=108.0s)]
*  But now a federal judge has granted the Federal Trade Commission's request to temporarily block it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=113.0s)]
*  Microsoft makes the Xbox console, and Activision Blizzard makes popular games like Call of Duty. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=117.0s)]
*  Regulators fear Microsoft could give preference to its own games over rival consoles Sony and Nintendo. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=123.0s)]
*  The action against Microsoft is the latest instance of the Biden administration's backlash against big tech, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=129.0s)]
*  after several previous administrations were lax in the face of mergers in tech. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=135.0s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=139.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is scheduled to give a briefing today on the next steps to deal with the deadly collapse of a key highway overpass. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=141.0s)]
*  Part of an Interstate 95 overpass in Philadelphia buckled Sunday morning after a fuel truck caught fire underneath it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=150.0s)]
*  Human remains have been found in the rubble. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=158.0s)]
*  Truckers say the closure of the major East Coast Highway could affect the U.S. economy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=161.0s)]
*  Trucker Joseph Fitzpatrick says the detours around the freeway collapse are expensive. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=166.0s)]
*  Every week this goes on, and every month this is going to cost me over $1,500 a month extra, just on tolls. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=172.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says the federal government is promising to help with highway repairs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=181.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc_rpDgfUr4&t=189.0s)]
