*  Millions of people are still without power after Hurricane Milton came ashore as a category three hurricane Wednesday night along Florida's Gulf Coast and former President Donald Trump campaigned in Detroit yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Christian Wright with NPR News and here today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=12.52s)]

*  There is a lot of damage across a very wide area, but its severity depends on where you are. You know, we drove into neighborhoods of very sturdy homes that looked to come away pretty unscathed. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=26.84s)]
*  Others where most of the damage came from trees falling onto houses and then some neighborhoods where heavy winds just tore homes apart. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=36.72s)]
*  NPR's Adrian Florido reporting. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=45.56s)]
*  TikTok is defending itself after confidential court records about the company were revealed by NPR and Kentucky Public Radio. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=48.6s)]
*  The material shows how TikTok executives and staff discuss the app's negative effect on young people. NPR's Bobby Allen has more. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=57.52s)]
*  Kentucky Public Radio and NPR obtained dozens of pages of redacted court records as part of 14 states child safety lawsuits against TikTok. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  The document showed TikTok released some tools to safeguard kids as a way of quote, improving public trust. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=74.8s)]
*  One company executive was quoted in redacted documents as saying that TikTok could get such a grip on young people that it could interfere with sleeping, eating and even looking at someone in the eyes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=81.36s)]
*  In response to TikTok, spokesman says the material cherry picks misleading quotes and takes outdated documents out of context. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=92.32s)]
*  In a slide from a TikTok presentation, the company said after viewing about 260 videos, teens can start forming a habit. Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=99.84s)]

*  Trump said if elected, he would revitalize the U.S. auto industry, which he repeatedly described as on the verge of total collapse. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=123.6s)]
*  He attacked electric vehicle mandates and promised more steep tariffs on foreign-based competitors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=133.64s)]
*  The speech was low key, lasting two full hours, and at one point Trump disparaged his Democratic opponent and his host city. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=140.92s)]
*  Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=151.56s)]

*  All of it done, the mayor said, without Trump's help. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do8i-kLuJ50&t=165.24s)]
