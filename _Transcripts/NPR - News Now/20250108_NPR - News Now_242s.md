# Wildfires Burn Out Of Control In Southern California | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, January 8th. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=0.0s)]
*  There are three large wildfires burning in the Los Angeles area and they are not under control. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=6.36s)]
*  The largest is the Palisades Fire burning northwest of LA. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=11.4s)]
*  It's less than 24 hours old and it has already consumed about 3,000 acres. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=14.84s)]
*  Steve Futterman is nearby and says the Palisades Fire is being fueled by incredibly powerful winds. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=20.04s)]
*  Listen to this wind, these gusts. In some cases we've heard reports from the National Weather Service of gusts nearly 100 miles an hour. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=26.360000000000003s)]
*  And when the fire begins these gusts just spread the fire rapidly and there's really very little the firefighters can do. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  Steve Futterman reporting from Los Angeles County. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=46.6s)]
*  There are two more fires burning in the area. The Eaton Fire burning in the Pasadena-Alta area has scorched about a thousand acres. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=49.44s)]
*  The Hearst Fire burning north of LA has charred about 500 acres. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  Thousands of people have evacuated. Both Los Angeles and Ventura counties are interstates of emergency. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=62.72s)]
*  Mourners are continuing to pass by the casket of former President Jimmy Carter. He is lying in state at the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  His body and his family were received there yesterday by members of Congress and White House officials. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=76.04s)]
*  Vice President Harris eulogized Carter, calling him a man ahead of his time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=81.64s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was that all too rare example of a gifted man who also walks with humility, modesty and grace. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=86.2s)]
*  Carter will continue to lie in state through tomorrow morning. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=102.32s)]
*  His body will then be moved to the Washington National Cathedral where his state funeral will be held. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Carter will be laid to rest tomorrow afternoon in his hometown of Plains, Georgia, next to his wife, the late former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who died in 2023. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=111.28s)]
*  Authorities in Las Vegas, Nevada have released more information on the man who blew up a Tesla cyber truck and killed himself in front of the Trump Hotel on New Year's Day. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=122.48s)]
*  NPR's Kirk Siegler reports the man used the AI service ChatGPT to plan that attack. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=133.2s)]
*  Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill says the cyber truck driver Matthew Livelsberger used artificial intelligence to learn how much explosives he'd need and where to buy them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  McMahill says it's still unclear why he chose Las Vegas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=150.0s)]
*  Do we consider this a terrorist attack or an attempted terrorist attack? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=153.72s)]
*  And I would just simply say that we haven't closed any doors on where our investigation is going to lead us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=157.04s)]
*  Authorities also released surveillance footage showing Livelsberger pouring racing fuel on the truck, which they say contained 60 pounds of explosives that ignited after he shot himself. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Police say the decorated 37-year-old active duty Green Beret had no prior record and hadn't been considered a threat. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=171.12s)]
*  Kirk Siegler, NPR News. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=177.64s)]
*  NASA says it will pursue two options for a robotic mission to bring back rock samples from Mars. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  As NPR's Nell Greenfield-Boyce reports, a previous plan was abandoned because it was too expensive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=185.76s)]
*  The original plan had projected costs that had ballooned to around 11 billion dollars. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  NASA Administrator Bill Nelson says it was unacceptable. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=197.6s)]
*  He says instead the agency will simultaneously explore two cheaper options for getting Mars rocks home. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=201.48s)]
*  One would use tried and true technology from past Mars missions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  The other would rely on new commercial capabilities. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=213.0s)]
*  The final decision is likely to come in 2026. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=216.4s)]
*  He says either of these two options would cost around six to seven billion dollars and would get Mars rocks back before 2040. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  Scientists hope that studying these pristine rock samples could reveal whether Mars has ever been home to life in any form. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=228.52s)]
*  Nell Greenfield-Boyce, NPR News. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wju7fcKMp8s&t=235.76000000000002s)]
