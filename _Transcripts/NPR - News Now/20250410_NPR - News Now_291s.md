# Maryland Man's Wife Demands His Return From El Salvador | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU)
*  Good morning. Today is Thursday, April 10th. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=0.0s)]
*  The European Union has announced it will match President Trump's decision. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  It will pause a set of tariffs on certain US goods for 90 days. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=10.34s)]
*  Trump's latest tariffs had only been in effect for a few hours yesterday when he announced he was suspending them for three months. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=14.16s)]
*  But as NPR's Franco Ordonius reports, Trump chose to boost tariffs on China. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=20.52s)]
*  Just hours after he urged Americans to quote, be cool about an escalating trade war, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump reversed course and issued a 90 day pause on the majority of tariffs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=36.2s)]
*  They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=40.52s)]
*  He later downplayed those concerns, claiming this was their strategy all along. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=45.64s)]
*  The administration is keeping a baseline 10 percent tariff on imports. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=50.64s)]
*  But that's much less than tariffs he was threatening on dozens of countries. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=55.08s)]
*  Yeah, while he paused most of those increased tariffs, he doubled down on Beijing, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=59.28s)]
*  raising China's tariff to 125 percent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=64.16s)]
*  He said it was punishment when China announced their own retaliatory tariffs. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=67.52s)]

*  According to the deal, Russia released Ksenia Karelinna, a dual Russian and American citizen [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=90.16s)]
*  who had been serving out a 12 year sentence in a Russian prison colony. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=95.47999999999999s)]

*  the ballet dancer was detained while visiting her parents in Russia in February of last year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=102.6s)]

*  She was later convicted of financing the Ukrainian army. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  Under the exchange, Russia's FSB says the US freed Arthur Petrov, a dual Russian-German citizen [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=115.16s)]
*  accused of illegally exporting military grade electronics in violation of US sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=120.75999999999999s)]

*  We're not going to give up hope to the Supreme Court justice, to the right thing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=149.48s)]
*  History will always remember you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  The US Supreme Court is examining Abrego-Garcia's case. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=163.04s)]
*  He was legally permitted to be in the United States. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=166.68s)]

*  Opposition has been brewing among conservative House members for days, despite direct pressure from Trump, who called on the conference to quickly pass the measure. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=212.72s)]
*  The delay is the latest in a series of setbacks for a bill that is meant to be the first step in a lengthy process, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYvbGd2EzGU&t=221.44s)]
