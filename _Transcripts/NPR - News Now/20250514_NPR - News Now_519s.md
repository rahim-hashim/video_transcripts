# Trump Meets Syria's Interim President, Pledges To Lift Sanctions | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ)
*  President Trump is in Qatar today after meeting with Syria's new interim leader. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And a new book alleges a cover-up by former President Joe Biden's staff [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=4.8s)]
*  about the decline in his health while he was in office. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=9.3s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=12.3s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=15.1s)]
*  President Trump has arrived in Qatar, the next stop on his Mideast trip. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=17.1s)]
*  Today, he met with Syria's new interim leader. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=21.3s)]
*  This comes after the former Syrian regime collapsed last fall after years of civil war. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Ea Batraoui reports that earlier Trump announced the U.S. will lift decades of sanctions on Syria. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=29.0s)]
*  The meeting included Trump, the Saudi Crown Prince and Turkey's president joining over the phone [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  for half an hour with Ahmed Al-Sharaa, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=39.7s)]
*  a man who just months ago was on the U.S. designated list of terrorists [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=41.8s)]
*  with a $10 million bounty on his head for ties with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=45.0s)]
*  But since rebel forces ousted longtime President Bashar Assad from power, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=49.2s)]
*  Al-Sharaa has switched from militia leader to statesman in a suit. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=53.099999999999994s)]
*  And this new Syria says it's ready to build a relationship with the U.S. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=56.7s)]
*  Trump says he heard from the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Turkey urging him to lift sanctions [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=60.5s)]
*  in order to give Syria a chance at rebuilding and pull it back from Iranian and Russian influence. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=64.4s)]
*  U.S. sanctions were mostly hurting average Syrians with an effect so far reaching, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=69.5s)]
*  hospitals couldn't import spare parts for machines or even fix their elevators. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=73.9s)]
*  Ea Batraoui, NPR News, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=78.1s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirms that he will be in Turkey tomorrow [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=81.1s)]
*  and he'll be prepared for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=86.0s)]
*  It's not clear if the Russian leader will make the trip. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=90.2s)]
*  Ukraine is pushing Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=93.2s)]
*  so that talks to stop the war in Ukraine can begin. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=97.2s)]
*  NPR's Joanna Kikissis has more. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said that if Putin does not show up in Turkey, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=102.9s)]
*  it will send a clear signal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=108.2s)]
*  Russia is not ready for any kind of negotiation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=110.2s)]
*  Zelenskyy says he will be in Turkey's capital, Ankara, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=115.3s)]
*  with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=118.5s)]
*  and would move to Istanbul if Putin insists on meeting there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  If Putin makes this step and says he's ready for a ceasefire, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=126.3s)]
*  Zelenskyy said, then this opens the way to discussions on ending the war. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=129.9s)]
*  Joanna Kikissis, NPR News, Kyiv. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=134.9s)]
*  President Trump says that Secretary of State Marco Rubio will attend tomorrow's talks in Turkey. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=137.9s)]
*  House Republicans are pushing to finish work on an enormous budget bill. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  They're seeking to slash $1.5 trillion in savings or cuts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=148.6s)]
*  Some conservative Republicans say cutting Medicaid would help achieve this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  They're also looking at shifting some funding for food assistance [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=157.0s)]
*  from the federal government to the states. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=160.2s)]
*  House Democratic Leader Hakim Jeffries says most of the benefits of the budget restructuring [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=162.6s)]
*  will go to the wealthiest 1% of Americans. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=167.2s)]
*  And they want to pay for it by sticking us with additional debt, trillions of dollars, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=170.4s)]
*  and by enacting the largest health care cut in American history, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=176.9s)]
*  along with the largest cut to food assistance in American history. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=181.9s)]
*  But Senate Majority Leader John Thune says Republicans in his chamber [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=187.3s)]
*  are willing to work with a new House budget. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=191.3s)]
*  And when it comes over here, we will be prepared for various contingencies, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  obviously one of which could be taking up the House bill and then offering a Senate substitute. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  House Republicans hope to pass the budget bill by Memorial Day. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=203.1s)]
*  A new book alleges that the staff of former President Joe Biden did much [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=207.1s)]
*  to keep the public unaware of his declining health. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  The book is called Original Sin, President Biden's Decline, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=215.7s)]
*  its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=219.2s)]
*  It's by journalists Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  Democratic political consultant David Axelrod said that former President Biden's recent public appearances [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=227.7s)]
*  do not help Biden's view that President Trump is not the right leader for America. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=234.1s)]
*  If he's concerned about President Trump and some of the things that President Trump is doing, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  then he should want the Democratic Party to be in a position to move on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=245.7s)]
*  and do well in the midterm elections. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=250.1s)]
*  Him being out there does not serve that purpose. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=253.4s)]
*  I think he's doing himself a disservice and I think he continues to do the party in the country a disservice. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  Axelrod spoke to NPR's Morning Edition. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=265.1s)]
*  A Biden spokesperson said that Biden's office did not review the book and was not contacted for fact checks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  The statement went on to say they, quote, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=275.6s)]
*  continue to await anything that shows where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  or where national security was threatened or where he was unable to do his job. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  In fact, the evidence points to the opposite. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  He was an effective president. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=290.6s)]
*  A Los Angeles judge has resentenced the Menendez brothers to 50 years to life in prison. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=292.5s)]
*  They were originally given life terms for the murders of their parents. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=297.5s)]
*  From LAist News, Frank Stoltz reports this could create a way for them to be released on parole. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  In resentencing Eric and Lyle Menendez, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=307.0s)]
*  Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Jesick said the two had done amazing work behind bars, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=309.8s)]
*  rehabilitating themselves and helping others. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=315.9s)]
*  The brothers were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the shotgun murders of their parents [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=318.9s)]
*  in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=324.7s)]
*  The new sentence makes them immediately eligible for parole. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  Both brothers addressed the court with the now 57-year-old Lyle Menendez [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=331.4s)]
*  alluding to the alleged sexual abuse the two suffered at the hands of their father, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=336.0s)]
*  but saying there was no excuse for the killings. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=341.3s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Frank Stoltz in Los Angeles. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=344.8s)]
*  There are continued concerns about air traffic control issues at Newark Liberty International Airport. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=348.5s)]
*  NPR's Joe Hernandez reports that on Monday night, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=354.3s)]
*  the radar facility that serves the New Jersey airport only had three air traffic controllers on duty. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=357.5s)]
*  The FAA confirmed that at least three controllers were scheduled each hour [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=364.7s)]
*  at the Philadelphia radar facility that directs traffic in Newark's airspace. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=369.4s)]
*  The New York Times said an agreement between the FAA and the Air Traffic Controllers Union [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  dictates that 14 controllers should have been working during most of that time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  Neither the FAA nor the union responded to questions about that agreement. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=383.7s)]
*  Delays and cancellations have plagued Newark's airport in recent weeks [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=388.2s)]
*  due to staffing shortages, technical problems, and runway construction. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=392.3s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan last week [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=396.5s)]
*  to overhaul the National Air Traffic Control System, which some estimates say could cost billions. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=400.1s)]
*  Joe Hernandez, NPR News. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  After being banned for life, the late Pete Rose and shoeless Joe Jackson [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=408.7s)]
*  could finally be headed for baseball's Hall of Fame. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=413.3s)]
*  Major League Baseball has reinstated those two players, along with more than a dozen others. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  As NPR's Becky Sullivan reports, most had been involved in gambling or game fixing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=421.7s)]
*  Commissioner Rob Manfred decided to posthumously reinstate them, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  saying players who have died are no longer a threat to the integrity of the game. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  Pete Rose is the Major League's all-time hits leader. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=434.2s)]
*  He was permanently banned in 1989 after revolutions that he had bet on dozens of Cincinnati Reds games [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=436.3s)]
*  and hundreds of other MLB games while he was the Reds' manager. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=441.9s)]
*  Rose died last fall after years of petitioning baseball officials to be reinstated. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=445.3s)]
*  The other major Hall of Fame possibility is shoeless Joe Jackson, who was among the best in baseball during his prime. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=450.1s)]
*  He was one of eight Chicago White Sox banned for allegedly taking bribes from gamblers to throw the 1919 World Series. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=455.5s)]
*  Becky Sullivan, NPR News. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=462.6s)]
*  Federal scientists say that last month was the second warmest April on record. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=464.2s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Sommer reports that continues a trend of near-record temperatures. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=469.2s)]
*  April was 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than average globally compared to records going back to 1850. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=474.3s)]
*  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=480.7s)]
*  that puts it second to April of last year, which means the hottest ever recorded. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=483.9s)]
*  Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere was also the smallest recorded, tying with last year. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=488.7s)]
*  As humans emit greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, the planet is steadily heating up. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=494.2s)]
*  The hottest 10 years in modern record-keeping have all been in the last 10 years. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=499.4s)]
*  But no, it doesn't expect 2025 to come in as the hottest. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=504.2s)]
*  That's because a shift away from the natural climate pattern of El Nino has a slight cooling effect on the planet. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=507.9s)]
*  Lauren Sommer, NPR News. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP-gyouBEtQ&t=513.9s)]
