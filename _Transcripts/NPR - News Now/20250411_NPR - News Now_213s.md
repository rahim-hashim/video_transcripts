# Trump Administration Lays Out Evidence For Deporting Activist | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0)
*  Beijing is raising its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125 percent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Trump administration has laid out its evidence in the deportation case against an activist and former graduate student at Columbia University. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=5.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=13.4s)]
*  China has moved to again retaliate against President Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=18.0s)]
*  Today, China boosted its new tariff levels on U.S. products from 84 percent to 125 percent. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=21.6s)]
*  This week, Trump again increased tariffs on Chinese goods. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=28.5s)]
*  China says it's not going to lift its rates anymore. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=32.0s)]
*  But NPR's Scott Horsley says the effect of new worldwide tariffs on U.S. consumers is a lot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=35.3s)]
*  We're still looking at the highest import taxes in well over a century. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=41.4s)]
*  There's now a 10 percent tax on everything the U.S. buys from most countries around the world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=45.099999999999994s)]
*  And the tax on imports from China is even higher than we thought, 145 percent. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=49.4s)]
*  Now, overnight, China punched back with its own triple-digit tariff on U.S. exports. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=54.8s)]
*  And investors are worried this could really be a drag on economic growth. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=59.5s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reporting. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=62.8s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has decided that the Trump administration must facilitate the return to the U.S. of an immigrant wrongly deported to El Salvador. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=65.1s)]
*  But the justice has told a lower court judge to clarify what she meant by ordering the Trump administration to, quote, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=74.0s)]
*  effectuate the man's return. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=80.3s)]
*  The high court warned that could go beyond her judicial authority. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  The Trump administration has laid out its evidence in the deportation case against former Columbia University graduate student and activist Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=87.3s)]
*  He is being detained in Louisiana. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=96.4s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports an immigration judge will hold a key hearing in the case today. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  Facing a deadline from the immigration judge to reveal their evidence against Khalil, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  the Trump administration submitted a two-page memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=108.3s)]
*  The memo does not allege any criminal conduct by Khalil, a Columbia University grad student and lawful permanent resident who played a prominent role in pro-Palestinian protests last year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=113.3s)]
*  Rubio's memo accuses Khalil of participating in, quote, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=123.0s)]
*  and says that allowing him to stay would undermine U.S. foreign policy to combat anti-Semitism. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=129.2s)]
*  Khalil's lawyers say the filing makes clear the administration is targeting Khalil for speech that is protected under the First Amendment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=134.2s)]
*  Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=141.2s)]
*  President Trump is scheduled to get a physical today at Walter Reed Military Medical Center. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=143.1s)]
*  NPR's Chairman Keith reports Trump will turn 79 years old in June and in the past has not shared a lot of details about his health. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=147.7s)]
*  President Trump last released detailed information about his health five years ago, though he put out a brief and positive summary during the campaign. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=155.7s)]
*  Given his age and the focus on his predecessor's health while in office, the results of Trump's exam will get a lot of attention. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=164.1s)]
*  S.J. Olshansky is a professor of public health at the University of Illinois Chicago who has studied the health of presidents. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=171.5s)]
*  There's very few people on the planet that are monitored as closely as U.S. presidents. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=178.5s)]
*  He says if everyone had access to health care like presidents do, it would have a pretty dramatic effect on life expectancy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=183.5s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=190.5s)]
*  New York City authorities say six people were killed yesterday when a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson River. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=192.9s)]
*  Five members of a family from Spain died along with the pilot. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=198.9s)]
*  Video shows the helicopter tumbling out of the sky, apparently without one of its rotor blades. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=202.9s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhxBfk_0Ob0&t=208.9s)]
