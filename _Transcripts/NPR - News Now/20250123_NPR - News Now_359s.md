# Trump Questions FEMA's Future In Fox News Interview | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ)
*  A Washington, D.C., Episcopal bishop says she won't apologize for calling on President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump to show mercy to immigrants and transgender people. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And Trump questioned FEMA's future in a Fox News interview last night. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=8.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=12.24s)]
*  I'm Cora Vickolman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=13.24s)]
*  President Trump has directed the Pentagon to send 1,500 additional U.S. troops to the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=17.16s)]
*  southern border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=21.12s)]
*  NPR's Quill Lawrence reports they'll support border patrol and National Guard troops who [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=22.12s)]
*  are already deployed there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=26.36s)]
*  A Pentagon statement announced that the ground personnel will support operations along the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=28.119999999999997s)]
*  border with Mexico as well as helicopters and intelligence analysts to support detection [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=32.28s)]
*  and monitoring efforts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=37.2s)]
*  The statement said military airlift may also be used for deportation flights of more than [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  5,000 people detained by Customs and Border Protection near San Diego, California and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=43.28s)]
*  El Paso, Texas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=48.44s)]
*  Troops will also assist in the construction of barriers to stop illegal border crossings [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=50.2s)]
*  And the Pentagon said additional deployments are expected. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=55.04s)]
*  Both President Biden and President Trump during his first term sent active-duty troops to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=58.32s)]
*  the border. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=62.8s)]
*  Quill Lawrence, NPR News. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=63.8s)]
*  President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, says deportation actions are underway. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=65.4s)]
*  These are supposed to focus on migrants considered a public safety threat. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=69.48s)]
*  There is no word of a large immigration enforcement action. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=73.0s)]
*  Homan is warning migrants in the U.S. illegally could also be arrested. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=76.72s)]
*  NPR's Jasmine Garz reports from Chicago, sanctuary jurisdictions like the Illinois City are waiting [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  to see what happens next. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=86.2s)]
*  In Chicago's Little Village neighborhood in a restaurant on the Main Street, every time [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=88.28s)]
*  someone opens the door, a waitress named Caridad looks up in fear. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=92.4s)]
*  She says she worries that it's immigration agents. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=99.8s)]
*  Caridad doesn't want her last name used. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=102.28s)]
*  She's in the U.S. without legal status. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=105.12s)]
*  The potential raids have turned this immigrant neighborhood into a ghost town. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=107.66s)]
*  People stay home out of fear. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=111.86s)]
*  Earlier this week, Mayor Brandon Johnson told NPR the city will stand by its sanctuary policies, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=113.78s)]
*  which prohibit Chicago police from enforcing immigration law. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  Jasmine Garz, NPR News, Chicago. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=124.78s)]
*  The Episcopal Bishop of Washington, D.C. says she's continuing to ask Trump's administration [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=127.74s)]
*  to show compassion toward vulnerable people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=132.12s)]
*  Bishop Marian Edgar Budde gave a sermon Tuesday attended by Trump. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=135.1s)]
*  She says she asked him to show mercy to people who include immigrants and transgender people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=138.78s)]
*  Trump later castigated the bishop, calling her insulting names and demanding an apology. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=144.38s)]
*  Budde says she was speaking to the unity of the country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=149.82s)]
*  I don't feel the need to apologize. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=152.94s)]
*  I regret it was something that has caused the kind of response that it has in the sense [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=154.78s)]
*  It actually confirmed the very thing that I was speaking of earlier, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=161.74s)]
*  which is our tendency to jump to outrage and not speak to one another with respect. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=164.78s)]
*  But no, I won't apologize. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=173.58s)]
*  She spoke to NPR as all things considered. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=177.5s)]
*  President Trump continues to defend his pardons of about 1,500 January 6th rioters. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  He falsely claims those who were convicted were innocent. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=185.02s)]
*  Some of the rioters were convicted for very violent attacks on police officers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=188.22s)]
*  One former officer says he's been betrayed by his country. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=192.78s)]
*  NPR's Odette Youssef says among those who have been freed by Trump are the leaders of two [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=196.38s)]
*  far-right extremist groups. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=201.42s)]
*  Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys said that success during this administration will be, quote, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=203.34s)]
*  retribution. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=210.06s)]
*  And the former Oath Keepers leader, Stuart Rhodes, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=211.5s)]
*  also said he's expecting the administration to exact, quote, payback for his and others' [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=214.94s)]
*  prosecutions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=220.94s)]
*  Those two groups, you know, they've both changed a lot in the last four years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=222.62s)]
*  They're weaker, they're less centralized, but now they're experiencing a boost and even [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=226.06s)]
*  other groups are emboldened. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  And here's Odette Youssef reporting. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=232.86s)]
*  President Trump was interviewed on Fox News last night. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=234.94s)]
*  He's questioning the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and what might [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  happen to California's request for fire disaster relief aid. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=242.54s)]
*  Trump is claiming that Democrats have mismanaged FEMA. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=246.54s)]
*  FEMA is going to be a whole big discussion very shortly because I'd rather see the states [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=250.54s)]
*  take care of their own problems. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=255.34s)]
*  He did say that the federal government could help states with money in disaster, but Trump [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=256.78s)]
*  claims FEMA gets in the way. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=261.82s)]
*  FEMA previously had run a site that debunked false claims about the agency's disaster relief [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=264.46s)]
*  efforts. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=270.38s)]
*  The president's remarks come as new wildfires break out north of Los Angeles. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=271.02s)]
*  The Hughes fire that started yesterday has scorched 15 square miles in less than a day. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=275.5s)]
*  Police in Nashville are investigating a deadly school shooting yesterday at a city high [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=281.18s)]
*  school. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=285.41999999999996s)]
*  They say a male student shot and killed a female student and then wounded another male [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=285.97999999999996s)]
*  student. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  He then apparently shot and killed himself. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=291.18s)]
*  Nashville authorities have not disclosed a motive for the attack. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=293.74s)]
*  They say they're investigating disturbing online writings. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=297.18s)]
*  Investigators in South Korea have turned over impeached President Yun Song-yol to prosecutors. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=300.7s)]
*  They're seeking his indictment on insurrection charges. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=306.94s)]
*  NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul that Yun has been in detention for eight days. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=309.98s)]
*  Kuhn has refused to answer anti-corruption investigators' questions and argues that they [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=315.1s)]
*  have no authority to investigate cases involving insurrection. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=320.14s)]
*  Investigators say they've secured evidence that Yun committed insurrection by deploying [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=323.82s)]
*  special forces to parliament and ordering them to arrest lawmakers. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=328.46s)]
*  Yun denies this, but military and intelligence officials say they received these orders [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=332.38s)]
*  directly from Yun and then disobeyed them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=336.85999999999996s)]
*  Only prosecutors can indict Yun, which they're expected to do early next month. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=339.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, a constitutional court trial is in progress, which will decide whether to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=344.38s)]
*  uphold or overturn Yun's impeachment by parliament. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=348.78s)]
*  Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Seoul. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCTAoCQskQ&t=352.38s)]
