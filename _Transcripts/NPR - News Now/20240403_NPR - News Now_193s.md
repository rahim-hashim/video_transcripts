# At Least 9 Dead, Hundreds Injured After Earthquake Rocks Taiwan | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE)
*  A Palestinian-American doctor walked out of a meeting with President Biden at the White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=0.0s)]
*  House yesterday, and several people are dead. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=4.42s)]
*  Hundreds are injured after a powerful earthquake struck Taiwan during morning rush hour. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=13.16s)]
*  I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=14.16s)]
*  President Biden met with a small group of Muslims at the White House yesterday, but [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=17.6s)]
*  one of the attendees, a Palestinian-American physician, walked out of the meeting before [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=21.64s)]
*  it was over. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=26.8s)]
*  As NPR's Azmahallid reports, it's a sign of just how contentious the White House's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=28.0s)]
*  relationship with Arab Americans and Muslims has become amid the war. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=32.86s)]
*  Dr. Tha'ir Ahmed said his actions were a kind of protest. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=38.0s)]
*  He recently returned from aiding patients in Gaza, and he wanted to share what he had [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=42.16s)]
*  witnessed firsthand with the president. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=46.32s)]
*  You know, it was tough. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=48.68s)]
*  I wanted to communicate that message, but at the same time, I also wanted it to be clear [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=49.68s)]
*  up until now, what the White House has done is not sufficient enough. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=54.26s)]
*  He said before he left the meeting, he handed Biden a letter from an eight-year-old orphaned [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=58.64s)]
*  Palestinian girl, essentially begging the president to not allow Israeli troops to invade [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=63.08s)]
*  the city of Ra'a, where she and more than a million Palestinians are seeking shelter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=68.52s)]
*  Asmahallid, NPR News. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=73.84s)]
*  In line with what other recent surveys are finding, the latest NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=76.68s)]
*  poll shows an uptick in approval ratings for President Biden. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=83.4s)]
*  But as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, he's still lagging with key groups. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=87.5s)]
*  Biden's approval rating is up to 43%. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=92.72s)]
*  That's a three-point increase since the February Marist poll. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=95.12s)]
*  His favorability rating is also the highest it's been in three years at 44%. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  Biden does well with black voters and college-educated white voters, but he's far below where his [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=103.06s)]
*  re-election campaign would want him to be with young voters and Latinos. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=107.42s)]
*  Sixty-one percent of voters 18 to 29 and 56 percent of Latinos disapprove of the job Biden [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=111.42s)]
*  is doing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=117.9s)]
*  Those are major warning signs for Democrats who need them to be on board come November. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=118.9s)]
*  Domenico Montanaro, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=123.1s)]
*  In Taiwan, at least nine people are dead, hundreds are injured after a major earthquake [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=126.34s)]
*  struck off the East Coast during morning rush hour. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  That's the sound of buildings in the ground shaking in Taipei, nearly 100 miles from the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  epicenter. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=142.56s)]
*  NPR's Emily Fang reports the quake prompted Taiwan's biggest semiconductor maker to evacuate [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=144.04s)]
*  production lines. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=149.78s)]
*  Taiwan's TSMC says it's closed some of its production lines in the south of Taiwan after [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=152.16s)]
*  a 7.4 magnitude quake hit the island. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=157.0s)]
*  The quake hit in the morning, but aftershocks continued for the next two hours or so, and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=160.34s)]
*  tsunami warnings from nearby Japan and the Philippines have been issued. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=164.58s)]
*  Taiwan is one of the world's biggest and most important hubs for making tiny semiconductor [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  chips that are in our electronic devices and cars. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=173.16s)]
*  And the U.S., which buys a lot of the chips, has voiced concerns about Taiwan's vulnerability [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=176.74s)]
*  to natural disaster, as it lies directly on a geological fault line. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  Emily Fang, NPR News, Taipei, Taiwan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zaSN6ZySzE&t=186.98000000000002s)]
