# Trump Signs Order Aimed At Transgender Women In Sports | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8)
*  Today's the deadline for federal workers to accept the Trump administration's deferred [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=0.0s)]
*  resignation offer. And a second federal judge has blocked President Trump's efforts to end [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=3.92s)]
*  birthright citizenship. Good morning. I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News. And here are today's top [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=9.36s)]
*  stories. Federal employees have until the end of today to decide whether they want to accept [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=14.16s)]
*  President Trump and his advisor, Elon Musk's administration resignation letter. So far, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=19.44s)]
*  some 40,000 of the 2 million federal employees who got the offer have accepted it. But many [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=25.12s)]
*  workers are wary because of the many different versions of the deal that have come out since [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=30.8s)]
*  last week. And Piers Andrea Shue reports unions are taking action. Several unions that represent [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  federal employees have sued saying the offer isn't legal. They've asked the federal court in Boston [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=41.04s)]
*  to halt this whole thing until the government comes up with a policy that is lawful. One thing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=46.24s)]
*  that the unions have pointed out is that federal agencies are only funded through March 14th. And [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=50.96s)]
*  there's a law that says agencies can't obligate funds that Congress hasn't yet approved. So unions [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=55.68s)]
*  and attorneys have been warning those who take the offer that there's no guarantee that they'll get [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=61.68s)]
*  the money that's been promised. And Piers Andrea Shue reporting. There's a hearing in federal court [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=65.52s)]

*  funding for educational institutions that allow transgender women to compete in female sports [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=77.2s)]

*  The president said he would quote rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=91.04s)]

*  women athletes. Opponents of the ban say there aren't many trans athletes to begin with. In recent [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=111.84s)]
*  days, Trump also signed orders seeking to ban transgender people from the military and cut [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=117.28s)]
*  federal funds for K through 12 schools promoting gender ideology. Ayanna Archie, NPR News. For a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=122.16s)]

*  go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Sergio Martinez Beltran, NPR News, Austin. Senate Democrats [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ueiw_PKKO8&t=172.08s)]
