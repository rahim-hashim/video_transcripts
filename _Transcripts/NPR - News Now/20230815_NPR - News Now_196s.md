# Trump Indicted In Georgia Over Alleged Efforts To Overturn 2020 Election | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE)
*  Former President Donald Trump and 18 others have been indicted in Georgia over alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=0.0s)]
*  And the search continues for human remains on the island of Maui. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=15.0s)]
*  Prosecutors in Georgia have indicted former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=20.8s)]
*  NPR's Carrie Johnson reports Trump and 18 others are facing a barrage of criminal charges for their alleged efforts to overturn the state's results of the 2020 election. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=26.2s)]
*  Beyond the overarching charge of racketeering, there are a number of other more specific charges, including solicitation of violation of oath by public officer, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=38.8s)]
*  false statements and writings and impersonating a public officer, forgery, some document related charges and false statements charges. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=50.6s)]
*  That's NPR's Carrie Johnson reporting. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  Access to West Maui is still being restricted as authorities continue to search for human remains in Lahaina after deadly wildfires. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Officials in Hawaii say at least 99 people have died in the fires. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=73.69999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Sommer reports residents on the island are feeling isolated, lacking power and self-service in some areas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=78.6s)]
*  We're hearing from some residents in Lahaina that they're eager to get back to central Maui. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  There they can get better Wi-Fi supplies and even search for loved ones. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=91.6s)]
*  The more direct route there is being restricted by authorities. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=96.3s)]
*  They say that road needs to be left open for utility trucks and supply chains. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=99.1s)]
*  If residents leave, they have to take a much longer hour long road that's very windy and dangerous. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  Today, residents in Lahaina got a text message that they should gather to get special placards to put in their cars to speed their return to Lahaina. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=110.0s)]
*  Many waited hours to get their placard. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=118.3s)]
*  The site was quickly overwhelmed and authorities shut it down and said they are abandoning that system. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=120.5s)]
*  Lauren Sommer, NPR News, Lahaina. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  Lawyers in Alabama are awaiting a ruling from federal judges over whether the state's new congressional map satisfies a Supreme Court ruling early this year. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=128.3s)]
*  Stephen Basaha of Gulf States Newsroom reports the state was ordered to create two majority black districts, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  but the panel of judges raised questions over the state's new submission. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=146.5s)]
*  Alabama's justification for ignoring the Supreme Court? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=150.9s)]
*  A new map and new rules means the court's order no longer matters. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=153.9s)]
*  Alabama recently changed its standards for drawing congressional maps, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=158.1s)]
*  so the state's attorneys say its newest map should be judged against those new standards, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=161.9s)]
*  not whether it made two districts where a minority candidate had a chance at winning. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=166.7s)]
*  The three federal judges running the hearing did not seem impressed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=171.1s)]
*  The same judges who initially found Alabama violated the Voting Rights Act. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=174.9s)]
*  One judge said it seemed like Alabama deliberately ignored the court's instructions. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=179.4s)]
*  If the judges reject the new map, they could appoint their own officials to draw a brand new one. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=183.8s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Stephen Basaha in Birmingham. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=189.3s)]
*  This is NPR News. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX0o5_wgKE&t=192.10000000000002s)]
