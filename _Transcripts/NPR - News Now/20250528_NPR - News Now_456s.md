# Trump Administration Appeals Pause On Deportations To South Sudan | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw)
*  The State Department has stopped scheduling visa interviews for international students [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=0.0s)]
*  as it plans more thorough screenings of the applicant's social media posts. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=4.5s)]
*  And SpaceX lost another huge Starship rocket yesterday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=9.28s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Curova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=13.88s)]
*  The State Department is planning a more thorough screening of social media posts by foreign [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  students who are applying for U.S. visas. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=22.56s)]
*  NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports it could make it tough for students to get an appointment [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=25.16s)]
*  with the U.S. Consulate in the near future. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=29.34s)]
*  Consulates should not add any additional student visa appointments until they get further guidance [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=31.42s)]
*  on how the new social media screening will work. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=37.1s)]
*  That's according to a diplomatic cable seen by NPR that calls for, quote, extra vigilance [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=40.06s)]
*  in the student visa process. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=46.1s)]
*  State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce would not comment on the leaked cable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=48.5s)]
*  We will continue to use every tool we can to assess who it is that's coming here, whether [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=52.86s)]
*  they are students or otherwise. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=58.82s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he's canceled thousands of student visas, including [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=61.42s)]
*  for students who took part in protests against Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=66.86s)]
*  Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, the State Department. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=71.34s)]
*  Several hundred people turned out yesterday at Harvard University. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=75.18s)]
*  They protested the Trump administration's order the university's international students [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=77.9s)]
*  leave Harvard or face expulsion from the U.S. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=82.18s)]
*  President Trump is also seeking to strip all federal funding from the university. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  The administration claims Harvard fosters anti-Semitism, a claim university officials [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=89.54s)]
*  reject. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  Jacob Miller is a former president of the student Jewish group Harvard Hillel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  He told rallygoers the Trump administration directives are intended to drive people apart. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=100.18s)]
*  The administration's excuse for these policies that they somehow address anti-Semitism are [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=105.30000000000001s)]
*  so absurd. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=111.5s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=113.34s)]
*  This has nothing to do with combating anti-Semitism. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=114.86s)]
*  The Trump administration has appealed another immigration-related decision to the U.S. Supreme [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=120.58s)]
*  Court. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=125.5s)]
*  This time the administration is hoping the justices allow for the deportations of migrants [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=126.5s)]
*  to South Sudan. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=131.06s)]
*  NPR's Jimena Bustillo reports the Homeland Security Agency says some countries will not [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=132.78s)]
*  take the migrants back. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  The administration arranged for South Sudan, a politically unstable country in Africa, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=139.9s)]
*  to take them in. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=143.9s)]
*  But a Massachusetts federal judge ruled anyone deported to anywhere that's not their country [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=144.9s)]
*  of origin needs more time to contest their deportation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=149.86s)]
*  Specifically migrants should get an interview where they have a chance to say they may face [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  violence or persecution if sent to a specific country. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=156.94000000000003s)]
*  Trump officials hope the Supreme Court overrules this Massachusetts order which applies nationwide. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=160.74s)]
*  They argue the pause on these so-called third-party deportations hurts foreign policy and national [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=166.22s)]
*  security and intrudes on the executive branch's immigration policy powers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=171.74s)]
*  Jimena Bustillo, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=176.38s)]
*  The federal sex trafficking trial of music mogul Sean Diddy Combs has continued. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=179.18s)]
*  A high-ranking former employee of Combs took the witness stand yesterday. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=183.98s)]
*  She testified Combs repeatedly threatened and once kidnapped her at gunpoint. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=188.3s)]
*  NPR's Anastasia Ciuccos reports. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=193.3s)]
*  Capricorn Clark, a former marketing executive, testified that Combs kidnapped her as part [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=195.9s)]
*  of a chaotic incident in which Combs attempted to confront rapper Scott Mascotti, also known [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  as Kid Cudi. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=207.26000000000002s)]
*  Combs had learned that Cudi and his on-and-off girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, were [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  dating and that Clark knew about the relationship but did not tell him. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=214.18s)]
*  Clark also testified that Combs and his associates had repeatedly threatened to kill her. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=219.5s)]
*  Clark quit repeatedly during the 14 years she worked for him but said she was unable [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=225.22s)]
*  to secure another job in the music industry. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=229.9s)]
*  Anastasia Ciuccos, NPR News, New York. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=233.26s)]
*  Home insurance companies in Texas are using aerial photos and artificial intelligence [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=237.22s)]
*  to decide if they want to keep insuring homes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=241.5s)]
*  From member station KUT, Audrey McGlinchey reports homeowners are increasingly upset. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=244.66s)]
*  Since 2023, the state of Texas has investigated at least a dozen complaints over the use [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=250.1s)]
*  of aerial photos. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=254.42s)]
*  One resident, Elena Callahan, got a letter saying the insurance policy on her home near [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=256.06s)]
*  Houston would not be renewed unless she got a new roof. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=259.97999999999996s)]
*  But Callahan says her roof is five years old and in good condition. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  Callahan worries her insurer was looking at the wrong house. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=266.62s)]
*  She asked but never got copies of the aerial images. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=269.7s)]
*  Where's the images? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=272.97999999999996s)]
*  What images are they using? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=274.53999999999996s)]
*  The use of aerial photos is one tool that insurers are using as more companies are choosing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  not to renew policies amid worsening storms. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=280.44s)]
*  Federal data show that between 2020 and 2023, the non-renewal rate in Texas nearly doubled. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=283.66s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Audrey McGlinchey in Austin. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  Israel has started a plan to allow some limited food distribution in Gaza. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=293.3s)]
*  For nearly three months, it has cut off the U.N. and other relief groups from distributing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  aid in the Palestinian enclave. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  This week, thousands of Palestinians gathered to try to get some of the new food aid. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=303.5s)]
*  But the process was mired in chaos. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=308.66s)]
*  Three deaths were reported. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  One is to say people were shot by Israeli forces and others wounded. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=312.42s)]
*  Israel says one of its helicopters fired warning shots to break up large crowds. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=316.3s)]
*  And Beers Ea Batraoui says the new aid process is chaotic. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=320.94s)]
*  So again, unlike how the U.N. distributes food or used to distribute food in centers [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=324.98s)]
*  across Gaza with IDs and lists of families in need, the system had none of that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=328.66s)]
*  There were no screenings or lists and no clarity on who decides who gets the aid and who doesn't. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=332.22s)]
*  And Beers Ea Batraoui reporting, no aid is reaching northern Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=336.74s)]
*  Several trucks intended for Gaza City yesterday were stopped. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=340.98s)]
*  Hungry crowds took food boxes directly off the aid trucks. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=344.82s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Berlin today. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  He's talking with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz about ways to bring an end to Russia's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=352.70000000000005s)]
*  war in his country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=356.70000000000005s)]
*  Esme Nicholson reports Ukraine is looking for increased support as Russia's bombing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=358.18s)]
*  campaign intensifies. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  Speaking to journalists after a one-on-one meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Friedrich [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=364.5s)]
*  Merz said Germany and Ukraine have agreed to start the joint production of long range [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=368.62s)]
*  missiles. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=373.82s)]
*  Merz said cooperation on an industrial level will take place both in Ukraine and in Germany. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=374.82s)]
*  The German leader raised hopes earlier this week that he would greenlight the delivery [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=380.86s)]
*  of Taurus missiles to Ukraine, but stressed in the press conference with Zelenskyy that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=384.76s)]
*  such decisions will not be discussed in public. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=389.46s)]
*  Merz did promise to continue and expand Germany's military support for Ukraine. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=392.46s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Esme Nicholson in Berlin. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=397.78s)]
*  The private company SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of its Starship rocket yesterday. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=400.82s)]
*  As NPR's Jeff Brumfield reports, it did not go well. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=406.55999999999995s)]
*  Starship lifted off from the coast of Texas to loud cheers from SpaceX employees. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=410.58s)]
*  Three, two, one. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=415.02s)]
*  It shot out over the Caribbean, separated from its giant booster rocket and powered [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=418.02s)]
*  its way to the edge of space. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=423.34s)]
*  What a moment. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=425.58s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=427.38s)]
*  Alright, but I mean that's… [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=428.38s)]
*  That was better than the last two flights, which exploded shortly after launch. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=429.62s)]
*  But all was not well aboard Starship. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=433.53999999999996s)]
*  About a half hour into the flight, it began to tumble out of control. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=436.46s)]
*  At this point, we are kind of in a spin. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=440.38s)]
*  The Starship is presumed to have broken apart somewhere high above the Indian Ocean. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=444.26s)]
*  Jeff Brumfield, NPR News. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=449.09999999999997s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJnc2ZjDCaw&t=451.56s)]
