*  After the House passed a deal to raise the debt ceiling last night, the measure now heads [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=0.0s)]
*  to the U.S. Senate and the field of Republican presidential candidates continues to grow. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=5.28s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=11.08s)]

*  to the Senate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=21.1s)]
*  As NPR's Windsor Johnston reports, time is of the essence to quickly pass the bill before [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=22.44s)]

*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reiterated that the bill represents a compromise and is a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=29.38s)]
*  win for both sides of the aisle. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=35.18s)]
*  We're finally bending the curve on discretionary spending because of this bill. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=37.86s)]
*  And we're doing it while at the same time raising our national defense and our veterans [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=43.7s)]
*  fully funded. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  In debate leading up to the vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffrey said Democrats voted [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=50.06s)]
*  to put people over politics. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=55.8s)]
*  Under the leadership of President Joe Biden, Democrats kept our promise. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNYzER8m-ZE&t=58.66s)]
