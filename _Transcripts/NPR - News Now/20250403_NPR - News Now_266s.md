# Trump Unveils New Tariff On All Imports From Around The Globe | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI)
*  Farmers are expressing concern over President Trump's new 10 percent minimum tariffs that were announced yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=0.0s)]
*  And a barrage of Israeli air and artillery strikes have hit targets in Syria overnight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=6.28s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=11.68s)]
*  President Trump says he is going to impose new tariffs on goods from all over the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=16.0s)]
*  The baseline tariff is 10 percent. Those will go into effect on Saturday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  What Trump is calling reciprocal tariffs on certain countries will take effect next Wednesday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=24.12s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley explains. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=29.0s)]
*  Trump calls these reciprocal tariffs saying they're simply designed to match the trade barriers that other countries impose on U.S. exports. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=30.92s)]
*  But the White House later acknowledged it would be too hard to calculate the actual trade barriers from every other country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=38.64s)]
*  So they just picked an arbitrary number they thought would be high enough to chip away at each country's trade surplus with the U.S. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=44.24s)]
*  And the result is a huge tariff increase, a 24 percent tax on imports from Japan, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  a 34 percent tax on imports from China in addition to the 20 percent tariffs that were already in place. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reporting. Stock markets are plunging. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  On Wall Street and pre-market trading, Dow futures are down about 1200 points. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump says he is standing up for skilled workers and for farmers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=70.8s)]
*  For Member Station KCUR, Frank Morris reports some farmers are expressing concern. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=75.4s)]
*  Many farmers say they've been losing money recently. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=81.24s)]
*  They're paying much more for things like fertilizer, seed and equipment, and they're getting less for the crops they produce. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Kansas farmer Vance Emke says President Trump's import taxes will make things worse. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  These tariffs are just absolutely bad news. There is no good news about them whatsoever. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=95.28s)]
*  The price for everything that we buy goes up and the price for everything that we sell goes down. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=100.8s)]
*  American row crop farmers depend on exports to make a living. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=106.2s)]
*  Emke fears that the countries they sell to like China, Mexico and Canada, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=110.08s)]
*  will stop tariffs on U.S. farm exports and drive commodity prices lower. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=114.12s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Frank Morris in Kansas City. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=118.84s)]
*  A barrage of Israeli air and artillery strikes hit Syria overnight. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  A doctor treating victims tells NPR at least nine people have been killed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=125.56s)]
*  Israel says it was targeting Syria's military capabilities and what it calls terrorist infrastructure. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  But Syria's foreign ministry says civilians are among the casualties. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=136.68s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Fraher has more from Damascus. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=140.52s)]
*  Cell phone videos shared with NPR show fierce battles, gunfire and explosions in southern Syria. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Akhli Hanafi tells NPR a farm night watchman was one of those killed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=149.6s)]
*  Israel confirmed its air and ground attack but said its troops were fired upon first. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=156.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes also hit military installations farther north, in Homs and Hama, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=161.56s)]
*  and a scientific research building in the capital Damascus. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=167.32s)]
*  Since Bashar al-Assad's ouster, no attacks on Israel have originated in Syria. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  And the new government here has said it wants cordial relations. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=175.32s)]
*  But Israel has attacked Syria preemptively several hundred times since then. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms72k63O0bI&t=178.48s)]
