# Biden Holds Press Conference Amid Heightened Scrutiny | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y)
*  President Biden spoke for about an hour last night at a highly anticipated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  solo press conference and in the aftermath of Hurricane Barrel about a [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=3.8200000000000003s)]
*  million customers are still without power in Texas. Good morning, I'm Korova [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=8.14s)]
*  Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. President Biden gave [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=12.5s)]
*  a very anticipated solo press conference last night. He spoke for about an hour [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=16.98s)]
*  and NPR's Franco Ortonius says Biden's performance was different from his [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=21.1s)]
*  debate last month. He looked and sounded a lot stronger than he did two weeks ago [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=25.24s)]
*  in his really devastating debate. I mean he did cough a few times but he didn't [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=30.72s)]
*  suffer from that same hoarseness that he wrestled with in that first debate. He [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=35.76s)]
*  was very unwavering in his attention to run. He acknowledged that a lot can [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=40.72s)]
*  happen but that he felt continued to say he was the best person to win. He pushed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  back on some of the reporting that he needs to go to bed earlier. He said he [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  made a stupid mistake in the debate, that's a quote stupid mistake, and that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=54.74s)]
*  he needs to pace himself better. NPR's Franco Ortonius reporting Biden did make [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  a gaffe yesterday during the press conference. He referred to Vice President [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=64.1s)]
*  Trump instead of Vice President Kamala Harris. About a million customers in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=67.98s)]
*  Texas still don't have power after Hurricane Barrel. Most of them are in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=72.58s)]
*  Houston area. Their utility CenterPoint Energy says about a half million [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=76.3s)]
*  customers won't get their power back until next week. Houston Public Media's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  Andrew Schneider has more. CenterPoint Executive Vice President Jason Ryan told [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=85.06s)]
*  commissioners that the company had restored power to roughly 1.2 million [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=89.66s)]
*  homes and businesses and it expects to have another 750,000 back online by the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=93.18s)]
*  end of the day Sunday. That leaves about 500,000 customers that we currently [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=98.34s)]
*  expect to have outages that go into next week. Ryan did not say how long it would [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  take to restore power to all its customers and much of the region is under [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=109.02s)]
*  a heat advisory. Ryan said linemen making repairs are struggling as well with many [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=112.66s)]
*  now working 16-hour days outdoors. Several commissioners told Ryan that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=117.42s)]
*  CenterPoint needs to do a better job of communicating what actions it's taking [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  to get the power back on. For NPR News, I'm Andrew Schneider in Houston. A federal [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=125.74s)]
*  judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana has found a Black Lives Matter pro organizer [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=130.82s)]
*  not liable in a case. The organizer was blamed for injuries that a police [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=135.38s)]
*  officer suffered during a protest in 2016. NPR's Sandhya Dirks has more. At a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=139.98s)]
*  2016 Baton Rouge Black Lives Matter protest, someone threw a rock at a police [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=146.1s)]
*  officer's head, wounding them. The protest organizer, activist Dewey [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=150.66s)]
*  McKesson, wasn't involved but the anonymous officer sued McKesson claiming [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=154.74s)]
*  he was liable. Activists, mostly on the left, worried such a ruling might allow [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=159.1s)]
*  for neo-Nazis to commit violence at a racial justice protest and leave the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=164.22s)]
*  organizer at fault. They also worried it would effectively kill the right to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  protest in parts of the country. But the federal court decision found that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  McKesson wasn't liable for the officer's injuries. His lawyers say the ruling [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=176.22s)]
*  establishes that protest organizers aren't responsible for violence they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=180.26000000000002s)]
*  didn't intend. Sandhya Dirks, NPR News. This is NPR. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBaO2wpiG1Y&t=184.8s)]
