# Haiti's Prime Minister Announces Plans To Step Down | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, March 12. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=0.0s)]
*  today's top stories. The special counsel Robert Herr, who investigated President Biden's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=5.18s)]
*  handling of classified documents, appears before a House committee today. NPR's Chairman [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=9.48s)]
*  Keith got to read more than 250 pages of transcripts from Herr's interviews with Biden last year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  The complete transcript paints a more nuanced portrait of the president than was described [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=20.02s)]
*  in Herr's report, which said Biden would come across to jurors as a, quote, sympathetic, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=24.38s)]
*  well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. In more than five hours of deposition interviews, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=29.38s)]
*  Biden cracked jokes, went into great detail about the design of his Wilmington home, and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=34.86s)]
*  spoke with confidence about world events. He also said, I don't know, I don't recall, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=39.46s)]
*  I don't specifically remember, and similar phrases more than a hundred times. In a handful [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=44.54s)]
*  of cases, he felt around trying to remember what year certain key events happened, including [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  the death of his beloved son, Bo. Biden recalled the day, May 30th, but not the year. Tamara [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  Keith, NPR News. Several states are holding primary elections today and Republicans in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=62.14s)]
*  Hawaii are holding a presidential caucus. One key state today is Georgia. NPR's Stephen [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=67.36s)]
*  Fowler says that's because President Biden carried the last presidential election in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=72.9s)]
*  Georgia by a very narrow margin. As you may remember, it was decided by about 12,000 votes [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  in 2020, so it's expected to be close again. I mean, look, Trump spent the last three years insisting he didn't lose the state. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=83.86s)]
*  It's been on the front lines of the fight over the direction of the Republican Party and how Trumpy it should be. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=89.3s)]
*  Biden won in Georgia by stitching together this disparate coalition that he needs to replicate this year, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=94.06s)]
*  from young people to black, Hispanic, and Asian American voters to moderate suburban types that backed his campaign in 2020. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=99.34s)]
*  NPR's Stephen Fowler reporting. A boat carrying humanitarian aid has left the island of Cyprus headed for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  Gaza. It's operated by the charity World Central Kitchen, and NPR's Alyssa Nadwarni reports that this is the first major aid delivery attempt for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=112.3s)]
*  Gaza by sea. The boat is loaded with nearly 200 tons of food, including flour, rice, and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=120.9s)]
*  canned vegetables. World Central Kitchen, an organization run by the U.S. celebrity chef [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=128.22s)]
*  Jose Andres, has distributed more than 35 million meals in Gaza since October. But this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=133.5s)]
*  will be the first maritime aid delivery in partnership with the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Cyprus. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=139.9s)]
*  This comes just days after the U.S. Army dispatched a ship to support President Biden's effort to build a temporary pier in Gaza for humanitarian aid delivery, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=146.62s)]
*  as the enclave currently has no port infrastructure. The World Central Kitchen says they are building a jetty in Gaza to offload aid onto trucks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=156.7s)]
*  Alyssa Nadwarni reporting. Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry says he intends to resign. NPR's Adr Peralta reports from neighboring Dominican Republic, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=165.5s)]
*  this comes after a gang revolt brought Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, to a standstill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=174.62s)]
*  Prime Minister Ariel Henry made his first public appearance in more than a week via a video statement. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=179.1s)]
*  He thanked the Haitian people and said that his government could not be insensitive to the chaos and violence that has engulfed Haiti. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=186.7s)]
*  He said he had agreed to resign once a transitional council was in place and once that council appointed an interim prime minister. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=194.14s)]
*  Henry was appointed prime minister after the assassination of President Jovenel Muiz in 2021. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=201.98s)]
*  His term has been tumultuous, he's been implicated in the assassination of the president, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=207.42s)]
*  and during his time in office, gangs have taken control of most of Haiti's capital. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=212.38s)]
*  Adr Peralta, NPR News, Santo Domingo. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=217.66s)]
*  you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz78qNnBlhY&t=224.14s)]
