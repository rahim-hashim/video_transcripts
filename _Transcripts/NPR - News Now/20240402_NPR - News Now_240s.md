# Aid Group Pauses Work In Gaza After 7 Die In Israeli Airstrikes | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk)
*  Iran is accusing Israel of killing several people in an airstrike on its consulate in Damascus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=0.0s)]
*  And a judge has expanded his gag order against former President Donald Trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=6.0s)]
*  ahead of Trump's upcoming criminal trial in New York. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=10.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=13.0s)]
*  Iran says one of its buildings in Syria has been hit by an airstrike. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=17.0s)]
*  It was the consular section of the Iranian embassy to Syria. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=21.0s)]
*  Israel is believed to have stepped up attacks on Iranian and Iran-linked targets in Syria recently. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=24.0s)]
*  But embassy grounds are considered sovereign territory of a nation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=29.0s)]
*  NPR's Jane Araf says several people have been killed in the strike. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=33.0s)]
*  Iran announced that a senior commander of the elite Quds Force of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=37.0s)]
*  and his deputy, along with five other people, were killed in the strike. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=43.0s)]
*  The U.S. has designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=47.0s)]
*  Israel hasn't claimed responsibility, but it normally doesn't comment on these kind of strikes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=52.0s)]
*  NPR's Jane Araf reporting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=57.0s)]
*  The food charity World Central Kitchen says it is pausing operations in Gaza [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=59.0s)]
*  after the death of seven of its workers there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=63.0s)]
*  As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, the group says the charity workers died in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=66.0s)]
*  World Central Kitchen says its team had just unloaded 100 tons of humanitarian food aid newly arrived by ship. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=71.0s)]
*  The group says a three-vehicle convoy was hit despite having coordinated its movements with the Israeli military. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=78.0s)]
*  Israel called the incident tragic and says it's carrying out an in-depth examination to understand the circumstances. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=84.0s)]
*  World Central Kitchen CEO Aaron Gore called the strike unforgivable. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=91.0s)]
*  Those killed were from Australia, Poland, the U.K., plus a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen and a local Palestinian. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=96.0s)]
*  Israel invaded Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack, which it says killed 1,200 people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=103.0s)]
*  Since then, more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=108.0s)]
*  Jennifer Ludden, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=116.0s)]
*  A New York judge has expanded his gag order against former President Donald Trump that's linked to his upcoming criminal trial. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=119.0s)]
*  The gag order covers any Trump statements about the judge's family and relatives of the Manhattan district attorney. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=126.0s)]
*  NPR's Jimena Bustillo has more. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=133.0s)]
*  New York Judge Juan Marchand expanded the gag order that he recently imposed on Trump ahead of the start of his criminal trial. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=135.0s)]
*  The new order includes Marchand's family members and family members of any council, staff member, the court, or the district attorney. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=141.0s)]
*  In his ruling, Marchand rejected Trump's assertion that his statements, quote, constitute core political speech. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=149.0s)]
*  Trump had targeted Marchand's daughter in his social media posts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=154.0s)]
*  Monday's gag order does not extend to Marchand himself or Alvin Bragg, the district attorney who brought the case. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=158.0s)]
*  Trump has, without evidence, said that the cases against him are politically motivated and declared them election interference as he runs for president. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=164.0s)]
*  Jury selection in this case will begin April 15. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=171.0s)]
*  Jimena Bustillo, NPR News, New York. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=175.0s)]
*  Crews in Maryland continue to clear tons of debris from the Patapsco River, where a container ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge a week ago in Baltimore. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=177.0s)]
*  As NPR's Laurel Walmsley reports, officials say reopening access to the Port of Baltimore will be more complicated than they originally thought. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=186.0s)]
*  The Port of Baltimore is a crucial engine of Maryland's economy, and getting a deep shipping channel open soon is a top priority. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=195.0s)]
*  But Admiral Shannon Gilreith of the Responses Unified Command says what's under the murky water is even worse than it looks from above. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=201.0s)]
*  These girders are essentially tangled together, intertwined, making it very difficult to figure out where you need to eventually cut so that we can make that into more manageable sizes to lift them from the waterway. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=209.0s)]
*  A temporary channel that's 11 feet deep is now open, allowing some commercial barges and tugboats that have been trapped in the Port of Baltimore to get out. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=223.0s)]
*  Two deeper channels are in progress. Laurel Walmsley, NPR News. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=231.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=235.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L8TbX0eSLk&t=239.0s)]
