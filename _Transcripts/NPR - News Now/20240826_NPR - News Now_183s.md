# Students Face New Bans On Phones As They Go Back To School | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA)
*  Live from NPR News, I'm Korava Coleman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump will campaign today in Michigan. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=2.6s)]
*  He'll be at a conference of the National Guard Association of the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=5.44s)]
*  Trump may criticize the Biden administration on this third anniversary of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=9.24s)]
*  Polls show Vice President Harris has taken a narrow lead in three of the critical swing states. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=16.4s)]
*  That's according to a new analysis from NPR. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=21.48s)]
*  NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports that Democratic enthusiasm for Harris is translating to advantages. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=24.4s)]
*  Vice President Harris is now ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania in an average of the polls. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=31.08s)]
*  If that holds, it would likely be just enough for Harris to get to exactly the 270 electoral votes she needs to win the presidency. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=36.48s)]
*  But all three states are within the polls' margins of error, and in the Sunbelt states of Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia, the states remain tied. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Harris and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will be in Georgia later this week. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=52.44s)]
*  And the Harris campaign will have plenty of money to make a significant push in the 70 days until Election Day. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=57.28s)]
*  It announced over the weekend it had raised half a billion dollars in the last five weeks. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=62.96s)]
*  Domenico Montanaro, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=68.0s)]
*  As students across the country begin a new school year, many will have to comply with a raft of new state laws that restrict or ban the use of cell phones in classrooms. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=70.4s)]
*  From member station WFYI, Lee Gaines reports at least seven states have passed laws in recent years to restrict the use of cell phones in schools. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=81.36s)]
*  Six of these laws take effect this school year, according to an analysis by Education Week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  That includes Indiana's new law, which bans students from using cell phones and other devices like headphones during instructional time. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=95.8s)]
*  The law provides exceptions for emergencies, medical needs and students with disabilities who need their phone for schoolwork. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=103.8s)]
*  Education leaders and policymakers from both political parties are increasingly concerned about the impact of phones on student learning and mental health. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=111.0s)]
*  And a study released earlier this year by the Pew Research Center found that nearly three quarters of U.S. high school teachers say cell phones are a major problem in classrooms. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Lee Gaines in Indianapolis. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=131.4s)]
*  The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Honet has weakened to a tropical storm. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=135.0s)]
*  It's passed about 175 miles south of the Big Island of Hawaii, but it dropped nearly a foot of rain there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=140.28s)]
*  Forecasters say this has triggered flash flooding. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=148.08s)]
*  Phil Becker owns a coffee plantation on Hawaii. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=151.08s)]
*  He says the heavy rain has flooded the bridges around him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  So that means people that are trying to get from Hilo to Kona or Kona to Hilo are trapped. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=157.44s)]
*  They cannot go either direction because the road is flooded. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  So that stops the traffic. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=167.4s)]
*  But more is coming. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  The National Hurricane Center warns Hurricane Guillema is aiming at Hawaii and could hit by Friday. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=172.12s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h25YtXs8_uA&t=178.04000000000002s)]
