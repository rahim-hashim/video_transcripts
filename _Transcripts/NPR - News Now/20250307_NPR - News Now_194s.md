# Trump Expresses More Doubts About NATO | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48)
*  President Trump is again expressing doubt about NATO's mutual defense pact. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=0.0s)]
*  And Trump says his cabinet secretaries, not Elon Musk, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=4.0s)]
*  are mostly responsible for cutting their agency's workforces. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=7.44s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=11.24s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=13.76s)]
*  President Trump spoke to reporters at the White House yesterday [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=15.48s)]
*  discussing a range of topics. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  He's again expressing doubt about NATO's mutual defense pact. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=19.8s)]
*  And Berserker-Ordonez reports Trump said the same thing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=23.36s)]
*  when he was previously in office. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=26.76s)]
*  A week ago, Trump said he would support the key provision of NATO [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=30.4s)]
*  that requires members to come to the defense of another if attacked. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=33.44s)]
*  But now he's told reporters at the White House [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=37.44s)]
*  that the U.S. may not defend allies [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  if they don't spend enough on their militaries. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=41.68s)]
*  Well, I think it's common sense, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=44.16s)]
*  If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=46.08s)]
*  No, I'm not going to defend them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=47.92s)]
*  I got into a lot of heat when I said that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  You said, oh, he's violating NATO. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump has regularly sent mixed signals about U.S. support for NATO. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=53.6s)]
*  He long pushed allies in the alliance to increase their spending on defense, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=57.6s)]
*  charging that the U.S. should not have to carry such a high financial burden [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=61.76s)]
*  of European security. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=65.8s)]
*  Franco-Ordonez, NPR News, the White House. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=67.6s)]
*  In separate remarks, Trump said he told his cabinet [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  that they are in charge of staff reductions, not billionaire Elon Musk. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=73.48s)]
*  And Bers, Bobby Allen reports, Trump seems to be reigning in Musk's authority. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=77.84s)]
*  Since Trump took office, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  Musk has been exerting wide and unusual control over federal agencies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=83.8s)]
*  In his capacity as a special government employee in the White House, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=87.56s)]
*  Musk has pushed the termination of thousands of federal workers [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  and the near total dissolution of some agencies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=93.48s)]
*  In his big speech to Congress this week, Trump praised Musk for doing it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  But now Trump is telling his cabinet and other officials [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=99.92s)]
*  they are in charge of policy and firings, not Musk. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Elon has been really teaching everybody about [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=105.84s)]
*  the numbers that you can do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=110.84s)]
*  But what I want is I want the numbers, but I also want to keep the good people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  This follows lawmakers of both parties raising concerns about Musk's chainsaw approach. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Trump is hosting a cryptocurrency summit at the White House today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=122.8s)]
*  He assigned an executive order creating a U.S. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=126.32s)]
*  reserve of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=129.2s)]
*  Critics allege the crypto reserve is a scheme that will only benefit crypto investors. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaram reports the president has a personal stake in cryptocurrency. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=137.4s)]
*  Trump was seen as a very crypto friendly presidential candidate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  He received a lot of financial support from people in the crypto industry. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=145.8s)]
*  And during the campaign, Trump also rolled out his own crypto venture [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=149.84s)]
*  called World Liberty Financial that's run by Trump's kids. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=153.0s)]
*  But he has a sizable financial stake in it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  And right before inauguration, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  rolled out their own meme coins. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=161.72s)]
*  That's a kind of cryptocurrency that the SEC recently said is not subject to oversight, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=163.56s)]
*  which has raised questions about conflicts of interest. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And Piers Deepa Sivaram reporting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=171.52s)]
*  A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to pay the money it owes [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=173.76s)]
*  to some global health groups. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=177.2s)]
*  Their payment stopped when President Trump froze U.S. foreign aid. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=179.16s)]
*  The judge says the Trump administration has until Monday at 6 p.m. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=182.96s)]
*  Eastern time to pay the groups. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=187.2s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad5ZPt-yJ48&t=190.24s)]
