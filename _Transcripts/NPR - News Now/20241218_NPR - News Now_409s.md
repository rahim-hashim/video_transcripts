*  Vitamin D helps our bodies absorb calcium, promoting strong bones and muscles. It also supports a healthy immune system. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=305.02s)]
*  Sunlight is the primary source of vitamin D, so reduced exposure during winter months can increase the risk of a deficiency. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=311.58s)]

*  Many doctors recommend vitamin D supplements to patients who have insufficient amounts, and more than one in three older adults take them. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=334.38s)]
*  When it comes to preventing fractures, experts say physical activity, including weight-bearing exercises, can be very effective. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=340.53999999999996s)]

*  From member station WABE in Atlanta, Molly Samuel reports the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to protect monarchs as a threatened species. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=355.74s)]
*  In the eastern part of the country, monarchs typically migrate to Mexico in the winter, flying through southern states on their way. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=365.02s)]
*  But some appear to stick around, especially in coastal areas in the South. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  Susan Myers, with the group Monarchs Across Georgia, says scientists and butterfly advocates are trying to better understand this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=376.14s)]
*  Just how much of the population is staying here, and what are they doing? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=383.26s)]
*  They're gathering observations from the public on the iNaturalist app and the website JourneyNorth.org. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=391.5s)]
*  They say the information could help with monarch conservation in the future. For NPR News, I'm Molly Samuel in Atlanta. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS0ocKq-e9U&t=397.9s)]
