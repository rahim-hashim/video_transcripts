*  On his first day in office, President Trump declared a national emergency on the southern U.S. border [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=0.0s)]
*  and took aim at birthright citizenship. And in his inaugural address, Trump renewed the threat to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=4.96s)]
*  seize the Panama Canal. Good afternoon. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=10.8s)]
*  stories. President Trump focused heavily on border security and immigration during his inaugural [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=16.56s)]

*  scores of executive actions on the issues. NPR's Tamara Keith reports Trump is taking aim at one [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=28.16s)]
*  right that is protected by the U.S. Constitution. Trump is already testing the limits of his [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=34.64s)]
*  executive power, including with an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=40.24s)]

*  temporarily. Birthright. That's a big one. Birthright citizenship is written into the Constitution and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=50.56s)]
*  Trump admitted he doesn't know whether his order will hold up to legal challenge. It's just [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=57.68s)]
*  absolutely ridiculous, but you know, we'll see. We think it, we have very good ground. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=64.24s)]
*  The order was part of a stack of executive actions signed by Trump in the Oval Office just hours after [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=69.03999999999999s)]

*  withdraw requires a one-year notification period and this decision could face legal challenges. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=245.20000000000002s)]

*  at the Department of State. Everything we do must be justified by the answer to one of three [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=280.88s)]
*  questions. Does it make us stronger? Does it make us safer? And does it make us more prosperous? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAhJnwVw-gM&t=285.36s)]
