# Trump Calls For 'Rogue' Judges' Impeachment In Fox News Interview | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw)
*  In an interview on Fox News last night, President Trump said rogue federal judges should be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=0.0s)]
*  impeached. And Trump is seeking to fire two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=5.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Krova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=10.72s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he plans to talk with President Trump today by phone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=15.36s)]
*  This comes after Trump spoke yesterday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=20.64s)]
*  The Russian leader says his country will agree to stop targeting Ukrainian energy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=25.119999999999997s)]
*  facilities for 30 days. But Ukrainian officials say Russia is still firing drones at them, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=29.6s)]
*  even hitting two hospitals overnight. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley says that the conversation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=35.36s)]
*  between Trump and Putin has gotten Europe's attention. This is deeply shaking the continent. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=40.56s)]
*  There's a view that Putin is stalling so he can continue the war and that he's playing with Trump, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=45.92s)]
*  who Europeans believe is naive, has no experience with Putin and wants a peace deal so badly he'll [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=50.08s)]
*  do anything. The former French ambassador to the U.S. went on French TV last night, Gérard Arrault, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=54.56s)]
*  and he said Putin is just signing on to the peace deal not to annoy Trump, but he's testing the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  waters to see how far he can go. He says it's Putin's dream for Russia to be treated as a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=63.84s)]
*  superpower, dealing one-on-one with the American president over the heads of the Europeans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reporting. A federal judge has given the Justice Department until [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=73.6s)]
*  midday today to provide more details about deportation flights over the weekend. U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=78.88s)]
*  District Judge James Boasberg had told the Trump administration not to use a rarely used wartime [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  power to deport the migrants from Venezuela. He even told the administration to turn the planes [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=90.64s)]
*  around, but that didn't happen. The Justice Department answered some questions about the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=96.0s)]
*  flights yesterday, but Judge Boasberg says he wants more details today. President Trump told [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  Fox's Laura Ingraham last night that some judges should be impeached. We have very bad judges and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=106.24s)]
*  these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think they, I think at a certain point you have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=112.72s)]
*  to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge. The Chief Justice of the United [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=116.72s)]
*  States, John Roberts, issued a rare statement yesterday. He says that for more than two centuries [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=121.6s)]
*  it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreements over a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=126.8s)]
*  judicial decision. Roberts says the appeals process is the place for that. A federal judge [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=132.16s)]
*  has ruled billionaire Elon Musk and his cost-cutting entity Doge likely violated the U.S. Constitution [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=138.16s)]
*  when they started dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development. Several fired workers [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=144.72s)]
*  it sued. NPR's Fatma Tiannis says the judge found that Musk and his allies acted improperly. He said [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=150.64s)]
*  that the evidence showed that quote, Musk made the decisions to shut down USAID's headquarters [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=157.68s)]
*  and website even though he lacked the authority to make that decision. He said that Musk and Doge team [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=163.52s)]
*  members likely violated the Constitution in multiple ways and deprived Congress of its authority to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=169.12s)]
*  decide what to do with an agency that it created. NPR's Fatma Tiannis. President Trump is seeking to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=175.28s)]
*  fire two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission. NPR's Scott Horsley reports the move [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  could prove to be a key test of Trump's powers over independent government agencies. The two [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=187.52s)]
*  commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter have promised to fight their dismissal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  in court. They say under current law they can only be removed for cause. Bedoya accuses the president [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  of trying to turn the FTC, which enforces antitrust law, into a lap dog for his rich golfing buddies. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  If you take away the independence of this agency the only people it will help is the powerful. The [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=210.56s)]
*  only people it will help are billionaires. The FTC's Republican chairman Andrew Ferguson says he [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=216.16s)]
*  has no doubt about the president's constitutional authority to fire commissioners. Ferguson says the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=221.68s)]
*  commission will continue its work to protect consumers and police anti-competitive behavior. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=226.72s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley. Israel's prime minister says any further talks before a new ceasefire deal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=231.6s)]
*  with Hamas will only take place under fire. More than 400 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=237.76s)]
*  yesterday. NPR's Aya Batraoui reports hospital records show 60 percent of them were women and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=244.4s)]
*  children. Israel's offensive dubbed Operation Strength and Sword began with targeted strikes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=250.96s)]
*  killing several mid-level and senior Hamas officials. The attacks shatter a weeks-long ceasefire after [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  talks to free Israeli hostages and permanently end the war hit an impasse. Hospitals in Gaza report [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=261.44s)]

*  block the entry of fuel, food, medicine and other basic goods that Gaza's two million people rely on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=277.6s)]
*  for survival. Hamas says it remains committed to the initial ceasefire agreement that was supposed [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=282.72s)]
*  to lead to a lasting truce. Israel's defense minister says Hamas must understand quote, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  the rules of the game have changed. Aya Batraoui, NPR News. This is NPR. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOxmobSoLKw&t=291.84000000000003s)]
