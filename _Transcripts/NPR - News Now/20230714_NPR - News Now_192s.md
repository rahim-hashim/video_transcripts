*  a promise made last year by the Biden administration in response to years of complaints, lawsuits, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=150.7s)]

*  The problem was many borrowers had made student loan payments for 20 years or more and should [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  have qualified to have their debts erased. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=164.4s)]
*  But didn't. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=166.54s)]
*  That's because the department and its loan servicers had mismanaged what are called income-driven [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  repayment plans. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=172.42s)]
*  For the past year, the administration has been adjusting borrowers' accounts to make [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  up for these mistakes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=178.26s)]
*  In the coming weeks, the department says it will erase $39 billion in student loans, with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  more to come. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KSMoF0g2ng&t=185.66s)]
