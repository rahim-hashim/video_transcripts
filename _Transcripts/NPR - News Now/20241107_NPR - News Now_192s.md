# White, Latino Voters Power Trump To A Second Term In Office | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4)
*  White and Latino voters powered Donald Trump to a second term in office, according to Edison Research. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=0.0s)]
*  And the World Health Organization says a polio vaccination campaign in Gaza has been largely successful. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Cuarva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=11.84s)]
*  We're learning more about how voters shifted in the 2024 election that helped Donald Trump win another term in the White House. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Domenica Montanaro reports that, according to Edison Research, white and Latino voters fueled Trump's victory. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=22.48s)]
*  White voters for the first time since 1992 went up as a share of the electorate, according to exit polls, and that clearly helped Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=29.2s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris wound up actually winning about 40% of white voters, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  which is how much a Democrat usually needs to have a shot at winning the election. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=40.56s)]
*  But a couple other things happened that sealed the deal for Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=44.56s)]
*  First, Harris didn't win a wide enough margin with women, and Latinos broke more heavily for Trump than for any Republican in history, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=47.6s)]
*  even more than for George W. Bush in 2004. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=54.8s)]
*  And that was because of Trump's dominance with men. 60% of Latinas went for Harris, but Trump won Latino men by 12 points. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=57.84s)]
*  Domenica Montanaro, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=65.36s)]
*  Republicans will control the Senate in the next session. Starting next year, they gained three additional seats. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=67.68s)]
*  There are some seats still too close to call in Arizona, Maine, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=73.36s)]
*  While Republicans will control the Senate, the fate of the House of Representatives is still unclear. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Many competitive House races also remain too close to call. There are tight races in blue states on the West Coast. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=84.32s)]
*  Trump's victory is being watched by European leaders. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=92.16s)]
*  The president of the European Union Council, Charles Michel, says Europe wants good relations with the next Trump administration, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  but wants to cut its dependence on U.S. trade. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=102.16s)]
*  We want to deepen our ties with the United States, because there is a lot in common. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=105.6s)]
*  But we also want to be more master of our destiny. We want to be more influential. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=110.96s)]
*  We want to strengthen our economic base. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=116.08s)]
*  And we want to act in a way where we are respectful and respected partners. This is the basic principle. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=118.8s)]
*  He spoke at a summit of European leaders in Hungary. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=125.44s)]
*  The World Health Organization says a polio vaccine campaign in Gaza has been largely successful. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=128.88s)]
*  NPR's Scott Newman reports from Tel Aviv that's despite the challenge posed by Israel's ongoing war with Hamas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=134.72s)]
*  The United Nations organization says that a second dose of orally administered polio vaccination [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  has been given to more than a half million children under the age of 10. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=147.04s)]
*  The campaign, led by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, was launched after the disease was found in Gaza [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=151.04s)]
*  25 years after the area had been declared polio-free. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  Israel's war in Gaza made it difficult or impossible for health officials to reach thousands of children, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  especially in parts of the territory's north, where many were left without the necessary second dose. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=167.28s)]
*  Several Palestinians, including children, were wounded near a vaccination clinic in recent days. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=173.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, about 90 medical patients were evacuated out of Gaza at a crossing near the Egyptian border yesterday. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=178.96s)]
*  Scott Newman, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHbOV3N97p4&t=185.76000000000002s)]
