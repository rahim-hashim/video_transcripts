# Hundreds Hold Vigil For Florida Dollar General Mass Shooting Victims | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4)
*  Hundreds gathered to hold a vigil Sunday for the victims of a mass shooting in Florida over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=0.0s)]
*  And crews are working to contain wildfires in multiple Louisiana parishes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=12.08s)]
*  The victims of the mass shooting in Jacksonville, Florida were remembered during a vigil yesterday. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=18.56s)]
*  Will Brown of Member Station WJCT reports a white gunman opened fire at a Dollar General store on Saturday, killing three black people. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=24.96s)]
*  Hundreds gathered under oak trees in an oft-forgotten neighborhood Sunday to remember Angela Carr, AJ LeGuerre, and Gerald Galleon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=34.88s)]
*  The three were killed in an act of racial violence on Saturday afternoon in a Dollar General store in Jacksonville's Grand Park neighborhood. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=42.64s)]
*  The Reverend John Guns of St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church knew Galleon for years. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=49.28s)]
*  And I'll weapon church today like a baby because my heart is tired. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=54.24s)]
*  We are exhausted. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=61.2s)]
*  The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office says the shooter, 21-year-old Orange Park resident Ryan Christopher Palmiter, obtained the weapons used in the racist rampage legally. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Will Brown in Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=73.28s)]
*  Emergency crews are working to contain a series of wildfires burning in multiple parishes across Louisiana. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=77.12s)]
*  The blaze broke out near the Texas border nearly a week ago. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=85.12s)]
*  Aubrey Yuhas of Member Station WWNO reports the fire has burned an estimated 60,000 acres and destroyed more than 20 structures. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=89.2s)]
*  Multiple communities in and around Beauregard Parish are under mandatory evacuation orders. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  As firefighters chase flames that keep changing direction. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=104.0s)]
*  Sheriff Mark Herford says the parish has the resources it needs to keep fighting the fire, but he doesn't yet see the end in sight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=108.08s)]
*  I don't really see us being able to completely have this situation in hand until we get some good, long reign. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=115.52s)]
*  The fire is just one of many burning in the area and across the state. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=127.28s)]
*  Louisiana's unusual number of fires this year, more than 400 this month alone, have been caused by severe drought and record-breaking heat. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=131.84s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Aubrey Yuhas in New Orleans. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=140.32s)]
*  Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo is taking part in a series of meetings in China this week. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=142.88s)]
*  The talks in Beijing and Shanghai come as trade relations between the U.S. and China have hit historic lows. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=148.96s)]
*  Raimondo says she's looking forward to having constructive discussions on areas for potential cooperation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  It's a complicated relationship. It's a challenging relationship. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=162.72s)]
*  We will, of course, disagree on certain issues, but I believe that we can make progress if we are direct, open, and practical. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  Raimondo says the economic relationship between the U.S. and China is one of the most significant in the world, with the two nations sharing more than $700 billion of trade. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=174.72s)]
*  This is NPR News in Washington. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtA6WsRsUW4&t=185.44s)]
