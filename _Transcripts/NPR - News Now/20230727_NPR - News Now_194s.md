*  More than 180 million people in the U.S. are under excessive heat warnings or heat advisories. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=16.5s)]
*  Many states have soaring temperatures and heat indexes in the triple digits, or close [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=22.26s)]
*  to it, such as in southern Maine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=27.04s)]
*  There are excessive heat warnings in the southwest, but also in parts of Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=29.28s)]
*  Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=35.0s)]
*  Storms in the U.S. have caused at least $35 billion worth of damage so far this year. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=38.0s)]
*  NPR's Rebecca Herscher tells us that's according to a report from the German insurance company [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=43.660000000000004s)]

*  point out, but are now a regular occurrence. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=67.22s)]
*  One reason is that people are moving to places that are prone to severe thunderstorms and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=71.04s)]
*  tornadoes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afjheb1HIl0&t=74.76s)]
