*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=11.96s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=12.96s)]
*  The Republican presidential candidates are campaigning in New Hampshire ahead of next [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=16.16s)]
*  week's primary in that state. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=20.2s)]
*  From member station WBUR, Anthony Brooks reports former president Donald Trump is coming off [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=22.38s)]

*  Trump rallied supporters, many of whom wore red MAGA hats in the town of Atkinson. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=32.32s)]
*  He touted his landslide victory in Iowa and said with their help, he can also win next [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  week in New Hampshire. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Brian Nado says he's supporting Trump because he's already proved that he can do the job. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  Keeping us out of wars on the world stage, keeping us energy independent, bringing people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=47.56s)]
*  into the country the legal way, the right way, and not just opening the borders. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=53.12s)]
*  In New Hampshire, Trump faces a challenge from Nikki Haley, who finished third in Iowa. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=58.76s)]
*  But with the support of moderate independence, she's within striking distance of catching [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=63.22s)]
*  him, according to some polls. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=67.44s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Anthony Brooks in Atkinson, New Hampshire. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=69.14s)]
*  U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  He's participating in a group that's trying to coax the private sector to build more [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=78.28s)]
*  products that don't contribute to global warming. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=82.88s)]
*  Kerry has also said he is stepping down from his role to campaign for President Biden. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=86.48s)]
*  Because I'm a federal employee, I'm not allowed to engage in the campaign. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=91.56s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=96.8s)]
*  So I want to be able to speak out on that and other issues globally. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=98.7s)]
*  The Israeli military says he plans to continue attending world climate summits. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=104.28s)]
*  The Biden administration is proposing changes to federal rules that would limit how much [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=108.56s)]
*  people pay in overdraft fees to their banks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  The proposal could cut the overdraft fee to as little as three dollars. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=117.28s)]
*  It would also slash billions of dollars in revenue for the nation's largest banks. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Financial analysts expect those banks to challenge the proposed rule in court. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli military says it has killed the leader of what it calls a terrorist cell in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=132.42s)]
*  the occupied West Bank. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=137.34s)]
*  Israeli raids, airstrikes and arrests were already rising there before October 7th, but [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=139.78s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from Tel Aviv they've skyrocketed since. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=145.34s)]
*  The Israeli military issued video, black and white aerial footage of an airstrike on the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  Balata refugee camp in the northern West Bank city of Nablus. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=154.46s)]
*  It says a quote terrorist cell was eliminated, but didn't say how many people were killed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=158.18s)]
*  Among them though, the Israeli military says, was a militant leader who'd received funding [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=163.62s)]
*  and guidance from Iran and had been planning an imminent large-scale attack. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=167.78s)]
*  Since the fighting in Gaza began, Israeli military operations have killed hundreds of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=173.44s)]
*  people in the Israeli occupied West Bank, too, according to health officials there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  Human rights groups and Palestinian officials say thousands of residents have also been [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  arrested. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=186.38s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBEQDYCpeo&t=187.38s)]
