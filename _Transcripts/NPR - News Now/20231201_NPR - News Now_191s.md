# Weeklong Cease-Fire In Gaza Collapses Overnight | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M)
*  Israel hit targets in Gaza overnight as a week-long ceasefire with Hamas has collapsed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal judge has blocked a Montana law that would have banned TikTok across the state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Koriva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=11.0s)]
*  The pause in fighting between Hamas and Israel is over. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=15.0s)]
*  The stop to hostilities lasted a week before resuming today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=18.0s)]
*  NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports there are still more than 100 Israeli hostages held in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=22.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire by launching rockets into southern Israel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=28.0s)]
*  It said in a statement, the terror group did not live up to its duty to release all the kidnapped women, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=35.0s)]
*  and with a return to fighting, Israel is committed to releasing all of its hostages and eliminating Hamas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=40.0s)]
*  Netanyahu's office said Israeli jets are once again targeting Hamas in Gaza, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=45.0s)]
*  and Palestinian media says there have been casualties from aerial attacks in the southern Gaza Strip. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=50.0s)]
*  The truce lasted seven days and saw the release of scores of hostages by Hamas and many more prisoners freed by Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=55.0s)]
*  Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=61.0s)]
*  One of the three college students shot last weekend in Burlington, Vermont, is speaking out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=64.0s)]
*  Kenan Abdelhamid is a pre-med student. He and two friends are of Palestinian descent. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=69.0s)]
*  They were walking when a man opened fire on them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=75.0s)]
*  Abdelhamid told ABC's The View he is now out of the hospital and has received a great deal of support. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=78.0s)]
*  I'm also overwhelmed with the support. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=84.0s)]
*  I didn't expect a story about a Palestinian being shot to go this far and wide, so I'm definitely extremely grateful for that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=87.0s)]
*  A suspect has been charged with attempted murder in Vermont. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=95.0s)]
*  The FBI is investigating whether the shooting was a hate crime. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=99.0s)]
*  The House of Representatives is expected to vote this morning on whether to expel New York Republican Congressman George Santos. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=103.0s)]
*  He is accused of nearly two dozen federal corruption charges. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=110.0s)]
*  The House Ethics Committee alleges he's committed more crimes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=114.0s)]
*  Santos denies wrongdoing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=118.0s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed reservations about the expulsion vote, noting Santos has not been convicted of a crime. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=120.0s)]
*  A federal judge has blocked a Montana law that sought to ban TikTok across the state. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=128.0s)]
*  As NPR's Bobby Allen reports, it was the first state law that attempted to completely restrict the Chinese-owned video app. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=134.0s)]
*  U.S. District Judge Donald Malloy wrote that Montana's TikTok ban oversteps state power and likely violates the First Amendment rights of Montana TikTokers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=143.0s)]
*  It is a win for TikTok, which sued Montana in May, arguing that the law amounted to an illegal suppression of speech. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=151.0s)]
*  Lawyers for TikTok said the national security threat raised by Montana officials was never supported by solid evidence, which the judge agreed with, writing that Montana officials seem to have written the law with, quote, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=158.0s)]
*  a pervasive undertone of anti-Chinese sentiment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=170.0s)]
*  TikTok is owned by Beijing-based tech giant Bike Dance. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=173.0s)]
*  But TikTok says U.S. user data is walled off from the Chinese company. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=176.0s)]
*  Instead, American tech company Oracle oversees all Americans TikTok data. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=180.0s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJRMn1Dey-M&t=185.0s)]
