# VA Ends Gender Dysphoria Treatment For Trans Vets | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ)
*  Hundreds of people have been killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Department of Veterans Affairs will no longer treat gender dysphoria for transgender [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=4.24s)]
*  veterans. Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Health authorities in Gaza say Israeli airstrikes overnight have now killed at least 413 people [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=14.72s)]
*  and wounded hundreds of others. Victims include young children. The Israeli government wants [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=20.72s)]
*  Hamas to release more Israeli hostages and extend the ceasefire that has expired. Hamas says it [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=26.08s)]
*  wants to keep to the terms of the original ceasefire, which calls for a phase two of that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=32.16s)]
*  agreement. NPR's Hadil Al-Shalchi says the immediate future is unclear for Gaza. It might [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=37.04s)]
*  be a little too early to tell if the war is fully back on or what these strikes mean exactly for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=43.04s)]
*  the ceasefire. You know, in recent weeks, Israel has been steadily increasing strikes in Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Hamas hasn't yet responded with its own strikes. But today's assault is, of course, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=53.92s)]
*  a pressure tactic by Israel to get Hamas to accept that extension. And they're a huge step back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=58.64s)]
*  NPR's Hadil Al-Shalchi reporting. Trump administration officials say they have more [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=64.48s)]
*  information about a Lebanese doctor who was turned away at Boston's Logan Airport and sent [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=69.52s)]
*  back to Lebanon. NPR's Tovia Smith reports administration officials claim the doctor was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=75.2s)]
*  found with extremist materials linked to a group the U.S. has designated as terrorists. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=80.72s)]
*  Officials say Rasha Alawi, a kidney transplant doctor affiliated with Brown University, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=86.8s)]
*  went to Lebanon for the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=92.08s)]
*  a U.S. designated terrorist group, and that she expressed support for him. Court documents [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=97.12s)]
*  reportedly described photos of him on her phone. Her lawyer, Stephanie Marzouk, declined to comment [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=102.8s)]
*  on those allegations but says Alawi shouldn't have been denied due process. We're not going [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=108.48s)]
*  to stop fighting to get her back in the U.S. to see her patients where she should be. And we're [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=113.84s)]
*  going to try to make sure the government follows the rule of law. Marzouk says they tried to stop [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=117.76s)]
*  Alawi's plane from leaving, citing a court order, but officials would not listen. Tovia Smith, NPR [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=121.84s)]
*  News, Boston. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs will phase out treatment of gender [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=127.84s)]
*  dysphoria. NPR's Quill Lawrence reports this follows President Trump's executive order to end [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=133.76s)]
*  any distinction between sex and gender by the federal government. Last week, the VA rescinded [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=139.76s)]
*  a memo that protected gender-affirming care. And now, VA Secretary Doug Collins says treatment for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  gender dysphoria will be discontinued. Collins said trans-identifying vets are still welcome at [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=151.28s)]
*  the VA for other care. But advocates say the change in policy means they will not feel welcome or safe [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=156.48s)]
*  at VA facilities. And they warn that discouraging trans vets from getting critical health care [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=162.96s)]
*  will have dire consequences. VA research shows that trans veterans have higher rates of death [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=168.0s)]
*  by suicide. The VA provides health care and benefits for about nine million veterans. VA [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=173.44s)]
*  estimates that fewer than one-tenth of one percent identify as trans. Quill Lawrence, NPR News. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=178.8s)]
*  A federal judge has uprated the Justice Department. That's for defying multiple [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=184.96s)]
*  court rulings ordering that U.S. deportation flights be turned around on Saturday. The flights [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=189.92s)]
*  were carrying hundreds of migrants whom the Trump administration claims are Venezuelan criminals. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=195.76s)]
*  And Biercerio Martinez Beltran has more. The Trump administration has until midday [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=201.27999999999997s)]
*  Tuesday to explain why it did not comply with the judge's oral and written orders to stop using the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=206.48s)]
*  Alien Enemies Act to remove migrants to El Salvador. The White House says they include [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  suspected members of Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. recently designated a foreign terror group. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=216.48s)]
*  The Justice Department argued that an oral ruling was not enough to stop them, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=221.76s)]
*  but that they did not fly any more migrants once the written order was released. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=226.16s)]
*  Judge James Boasberg called that, quote, a heck of a stretch. The hearing raised multiple questions, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=230.32s)]
*  including about the weight of an oral order compared to a written one. According to the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=236.0s)]
*  White House, 261 people were removed to El Salvador, but only 137 of them were expelled [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=240.0s)]
*  under Trump's wartime power at the core of the case. Sergio Martinez Beltran, NPR News. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=245.84s)]
*  New research shows that iguanas on the island of Fiji likely floated there on a raft from North [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=251.12s)]
*  America. As NPR's Jonathan Lambert reports, it is likely the longest such voyage by any land vertebrate. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=258.16s)]
*  How iguanas got to Fiji from the Americas has long been a mystery. The lizards could have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=265.2s)]
*  walked over many generations across ancient land bridges, or they could have floated there on a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=270.96s)]
*  raft of tangled vegetation. New genetic analyses published in the journal PNAS point to the raft [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=276.96s)]
*  idea. The study says Fijian iguanas are likely too young, evolutionarily speaking, to have crossed [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  the ancient land bridges, and that suggests that these lizards floated around 5,000 miles to reach [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=289.84s)]
*  the island. Jonathan Lambert, NPR News. And I'm Korava Coleman, NPR News from Washington. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_eDuknyXQ&t=296.16s)]
