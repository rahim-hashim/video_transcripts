# Putin Changes Russia's Nuclear Doctrine As U.S. Ramps Up Support For Ukraine | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU)
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin has approved changes to his country's nuclear doctrine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=0.0s)]
*  And President-elect Donald Trump has tapped another Fox News contributor for his cabinet. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=5.08s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=9.88s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree updating his country's nuclear doctrine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  It expands Russia's options for carrying out a nuclear strike. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=18.6s)]
*  NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow they appear to be a response to growing U.S. military support for Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=21.76s)]
*  Under the changes, Russia reserves the right to respond to a conventional attack by countries supported by a nuclear power with its own nuclear strike. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=27.84s)]
*  The Kremlin claims the revisions to the nuclear doctrine are defensive in nature. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=35.92s)]
*  But the updated text means anything from an enemy drone to conventional missiles or aircraft could trigger a Russian nuclear response. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=39.8s)]
*  The Kremlin first announced the planned revisions in September, but Putin's signing appeared a direct response to reports the Biden administration had approved Ukraine's use of U.S. missiles to target deep inside Russia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=46.68s)]
*  The Kremlin says it has yet to receive confirmation of that change in U.S. policy, but warned if true, Russia viewed the move as a major escalation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=57.8s)]
*  Charles Maynes, NPR News, Moscow. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=65.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, Russia claims Ukraine has carried out its first attacks using U.S.-made long-range missiles on Russian territory. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Russia says Ukraine fired six attack missiles into Western Russia. No injuries were reported. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=74.8s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump is tapping another Fox News contributor for his cabinet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=81.16s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports he's chosen former GOP Congressman Sean Duffy to head the Department of Transportation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=85.92s)]
*  Duffy represented a district in his native Wisconsin in the House of Representatives for eight years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=92.72s)]
*  He's worked as a contributor at Fox News since 2020 and hosted the bottom line on the Fox Business Network since 2023. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=97.44s)]
*  Duffy's roots in the television business run deep. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=104.52s)]
*  He appeared on MTV's The Real World in 1997 before going on to serve as a district attorney in northern Wisconsin and then in Congress, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=106.88s)]
*  where he sat on the House Financial Services Committee. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  This is the second time in as many weeks that President-elect Trump has chosen a Fox host to serve in his cabinet. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=117.2s)]
*  Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  President Biden has asked Congress for nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster relief for Americans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=125.08s)]
*  It's to deal with crises such as the recent Hurricane Helene, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=131.44s)]
*  the storm damage to North Carolina factory that produces IV fluids for much of the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=135.28s)]
*  NPR's Sidney Lepkin reports the factory is starting to recover. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Javier Becerra is celebrating a milestone in recovery from Hurricane Helene. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  As ordinary and mundane as that might look, to see those trucks rolling out, right there, that's helping save some lives. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=150.88s)]
*  He was pointing at trucks filled with freshly made IV fluids driving over a temporary bridge and out into the world. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=161.27999999999997s)]
*  Helene flooded the Baxter International factory that made 60 percent of the IV fluid used in hospitals around the country. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=168.12s)]
*  The government has been helping the company get the facility back up and running. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=174.52s)]
*  Officials say hospitals should be able to order their usual amounts of many IV fluid products by the end of the year. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=178.44s)]
*  Sidney Lepkin, NPR News. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Superstar singer Beyoncé will bring her own holiday gift to football fans. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=186.44s)]
*  She plans to provide the halftime show during Netflix's Christmas Day live stream of the NFL game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Houston Texans. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=190.4s)]
*  NPR's Eric Deggans reports her appearance only raises the stakes for the streamer. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=198.8s)]
*  When Netflix live streamed a boxing match between YouTube star Jake Paul and former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson on Friday, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  they drew 60 million households and an avalanche of complaints over bad connections and disconnected service, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=211.0s)]
*  which raises questions over how Netflix will handle live broadcasts of two NFL games on Christmas Day, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  especially now that one game includes a show by one of the world's biggest music stars. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=224.0s)]
*  Fans are also hopeful that another megastar, Taylor Swift, might show for the other Christmas Day game, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=229.0s)]
*  which features the Pittsburgh Steelers versus the Kansas City Chiefs, with presumably Swiss boyfriend Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=235.2s)]
*  That could also increase viewers at a time when doubts remain about Netflix's capacity. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=243.4s)]
*  Eric Deggans, NPR News. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyug4nZweIU&t=248.4s)]
