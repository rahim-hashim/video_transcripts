# Trump Taps TV Personality Dr. Oz To Oversee Medicare, Medicaid | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM)
*  President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate Dr. Oz to oversee the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=0.0s)]
*  And Texas is one step closer to teaching Bible stories in elementary school classes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=12.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Dr. Mehmet Oz to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=16.0s)]
*  NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reports Oz is best known for his former daily talk show. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=22.0s)]
*  Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, he built his fame and fortune by promoting alternative therapies like unproven diet products, cleanses, and detoxes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=27.0s)]
*  He first became famous as a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show. That led to a radio show and daytime TV's The Dr. Oz Show. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=36.0s)]
*  That ended in 2022 when Oz ran as the Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania. He narrowly lost to John Fetterman in that race. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=43.0s)]
*  If he's confirmed by the Senate, he'll be overseeing an enormous health agency that spends about $1.5 trillion a year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=52.0s)]
*  Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR News, Washington. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=59.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump has also nominated Linda McMahon to run the Education Department. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=62.0s)]
*  She ran the Small Business Administration when Trump was first president. She's a former pro-wrestling magnet. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=66.0s)]
*  Trump also tapped billionaire investor and Wall Street executive Howard Lefnick to run the Commerce Department. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=72.0s)]
*  Israel is using a new kind of weapon in the war in Gaza, a sniper drone. That's according to more than a dozen eyewitness accounts collected by NPR. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=78.0s)]
*  As NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports, witnesses say these are being used to shoot civilians. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=87.0s)]
*  For months, NPR has been hearing about a small quadcopter drone with a rifle attached, shooting at civilians, medical professionals, and first responders in Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=93.0s)]
*  Several eyewitnesses, including visiting doctors from other countries, have described the technology being used to shoot and sometimes kill civilians, including children. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=102.0s)]
*  The Israeli military told NPR it was unaware of such incidents and that any suggestion that it intends to harm civilians is, quote, unfounded and baseless. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=111.0s)]
*  NPR also asked the Israeli military repeatedly if it was using this sniper drone technology in Gaza. It did not respond to the question. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=120.0s)]
*  But the technology exists, is produced by companies with ties to Israel, and has been touted by the Israeli military in the past. Kat Lonsdorf, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=128.0s)]
*  The Texas State Board of Education has moved a step closer to approving a controversial curriculum that puts Bible stories in elementary school classes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=138.0s)]
*  For Member Station KERA in Dallas, Bill Ziebel has more. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=148.0s)]
*  The Texas Education Agency proposed a curriculum from Blue Bonnet Learning designed to build a broad array of student skills. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=152.0s)]
*  It incorporates Bible lessons like the Golden Rule. But critics, including Southern Methodist University Religious Studies professor Mark Chansey, say the focus tilts heavily toward Christianity. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=159.0s)]
*  Not only is it taught in such a way that's going to promote some religions over others, but in many cases it even just gets the basic facts wrong. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=169.0s)]
*  The Texas State Board of Education is scheduled to take a final vote on Friday. I'm Bill Ziebel in Dallas. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=181.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRf814uaAM&t=187.0s)]
