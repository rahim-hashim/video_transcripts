# Russia Opposition Leader Alexei Navalny Dead At 47 | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, February 16th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Cora Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=2.84s)]
*  Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure, has died in a remote [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=6.44s)]
*  Russian prison at the age of 47. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=10.88s)]
*  As NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow, Navalny had been serving a lengthy [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=13.48s)]
*  prison term widely seen as punishment for his years of criticism of Russian [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=17.8s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  News of Navalny's death came from the Federal Penitentiary Service in Russia's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=23.88s)]
*  Arctic, where Navalny had been serving out a 19 year sentence. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=27.56s)]
*  In a statement, prison authorities said Navalny lost consciousness after a walk [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=31.04s)]
*  in the prison yard and that attempts by medical staff to resuscitate him, quote, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=34.72s)]
*  failed to yield positive results. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=38.28s)]
*  Navalny's family could not immediately confirm the news, but have repeatedly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=40.4s)]
*  expressed concerns about his health and treatment in prison. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=43.4s)]
*  In 2020, Navalny was the victim of a near fatal poisoning attack he blamed on the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Russian government. The Kremlin spokesman said President Vladimir Putin had been [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  informed and the prison medics were working to identify the cause of death. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=54.04s)]
*  Charles Maynes in PR News, Moscow. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  National security advisor, Jake Sullivan says Navalny's death is a tragedy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=59.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Sullivan met yesterday with top congressional leaders over news of a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  new Russian anti-satellite capability. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=68.84s)]
*  Earlier this week, the Republican chair of the House Intelligence Committee [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=71.92s)]
*  released information. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=75.4s)]
*  He called on President Biden to declassify information about a national [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=76.72s)]
*  security threat. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=81.36s)]
*  Sullivan says he has now briefed the committee chair and other congressional [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=83.04s)]
*  leaders about Russia's anti-satellite capability. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=86.76s)]
*  We talked about the steps the administration is taking to deal with this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=90.04s)]
*  and to ensure the security of the American people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=93.12s)]
*  It was a bipartisan meeting. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=95.64s)]
*  People focused both Democrats and Republicans on the substance, not on the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=97.76s)]
*  politics or the public's Sturm und Drang. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  And I think we emerged with a good understanding of the way forward. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Sullivan spoke to NPR's morning edition. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  The Russian anti-satellite capability is not something that has yet been deployed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=111.28s)]
*  An FBI informant has been charged with lying to authorities for allegedly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=116.76s)]
*  fabricating claims about a purported bribery scheme involving Joe Biden, his [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=120.76s)]
*  son Hunter and a Ukrainian energy company. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=125.56s)]
*  The informants claims have featured into the Republican effort to impeach [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=128.56s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=132.68s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas has more. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=133.96s)]
*  Alexander Smirnoff is charged with making false statements and creating a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  false and fictitious record. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=138.76s)]
*  The case was brought by special counsel David Weiss, who is overseeing the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=140.56s)]
*  separate criminal prosecutions against Hunter Biden on gun and tax charges. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=143.64s)]
*  According to the indictment, Smirnoff told the FBI that the Ukrainian energy [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=148.16s)]
*  company, Burisma, had paid millions of dollars in bribes to then Vice President [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=151.72s)]
*  Joe Biden and his son Hunter to protect the company from investigators. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  But prosecutors say that was a lie and that Smirnoff made the claims up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=160.76s)]
*  The indictment against Smirnoff deals a blow to House Republicans who have pointed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=165.24s)]
*  to Smirnoff's allegations in their push to impeach President Biden. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=169.0s)]
*  In the wake of the indictment, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=172.68s)]
*  says it still has ample reason to continue its investigation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=175.96s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=179.28s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3wBw5q338U&t=181.2s)]
