# Harris Delivers A Closing Pitch To Voters From The Ellipse | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, October 30th. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=0.0s)]
*  There's less than a week to go before Election Day. Former President Donald Trump held a rally last night in Allentown, Pennsylvania. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=6.24s)]
*  He says the U.S. has turned into a dumping ground for people entering the country illegally. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=13.16s)]
*  I'm going to protect our women from criminals coming into our country, going up to the suburbs and doing really bad things. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=18.0s)]
*  We're going to protect our men, our women, our children. We're going to protect our country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  100% protect our country. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=29.8s)]
*  The FBI's latest data show violent crime in the U.S. has fallen significantly recently. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=32.8s)]
*  Stanford University researchers say that since the 1960s, immigrants have been 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=38.2s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris gave a major speech last night on the ellipse in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=47.2s)]
*  The White House was illuminated in the background. Harris contrasted her career with that of Trump, saying she has worked to protect Americans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  For decades, as a prosecutor and a top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against big banks that ripped off homeowners, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=59.6s)]
*  against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students, against predators who abused women and children, and cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=70.6s)]
*  Harris gave her speech on the same spot that then President Trump used on January 6, 2021, to talk to his supporters. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=86.6s)]
*  After that speech, some of the Trump supporters in the crowd attacked the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=94.6s)]
*  Former President Trump campaigns in North Carolina and Wisconsin today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Vice President Harris is also in North Carolina. Then she will visit Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  Former President Trump and his allies are going after a remark by President Biden last night, where Biden appeared to call Trump supporters quote garbage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, this comes after a controversy following a Trump rally in New York, where a comedian referred to Puerto Rico as a quote, floating island of garbage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=118.2s)]
*  Biden was on a video call with the group Voto Latino talking about the Trump backing comedian's widely panned joke about Puerto Rico when he said this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=128.6s)]
*  They're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization is seen as unconscionable. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=137.8s)]
*  Biden promptly tweeted out a clarification saying he was talking about the quote hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump supporters at his rally and not Trump supporters broadly. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  But by then, Trump and his allies had already expressed outrage and demanded an apology. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=158.4s)]
*  Trump hasn't yet apologized for what was said at his rally on Sunday. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=163.8s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLqbdrJfJI&t=168.3s)]
