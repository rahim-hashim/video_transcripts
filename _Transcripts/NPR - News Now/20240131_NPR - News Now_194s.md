# Republicans Advance Articles Of Impeachment Against Mayorkas | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU)
*  A House panel has advanced articles of impeachment against the Secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Biden won't say more about how the U.S. will respond to the attack on U.S. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  soldiers last weekend in Jordan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=9.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  The House Homeland Security Committee has approved two articles to impeach Homeland [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=16.52s)]
*  Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=20.0s)]
*  NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports on the debate leading up to the party line vote early this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  morning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Chair Mark Green argued Secretary Mayorkas put his political views above his duty to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=28.4s)]
*  protect the country's security. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  We cannot allow this man to remain in office any longer. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  The time for accountability is now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=38.96s)]
*  The resolution charges Mayorkas with willfully ignoring the law and breaching the public's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=41.4s)]
*  trust. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=46.16s)]
*  Democrats on the panel call the effort a sham and say there's no evidence of a high crime [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=47.16s)]
*  or misdemeanor. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=51.84s)]
*  Many accused GOP lawmakers of taking their marching orders from former president and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=53.6s)]
*  likely 2024 nominee Donald Trump, who is stressing border security in his campaign. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=58.36s)]
*  Even if the charges are approved by the full House in the coming days, it's unlikely the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=64.6s)]
*  Senate would remove Secretary Mayorkas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=68.92s)]
*  Deirdre Walsh, NPR News, the Capitol. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=71.68s)]
*  Special counsel Jack Smith is in Florida today for a closed-door meeting with U.S. District [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=74.36s)]
*  Judge Eileen Cannon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=78.84s)]
*  NPR's Greg Allen reports this will deal with former President Trump's upcoming trial on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=80.6s)]
*  charges he withheld and concealed classified government documents. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=85.32s)]
*  It's not clear exactly why Judge Cannon set this meeting with Jack Smith. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=89.84s)]
*  It's related to the special counsel office's request that a certain number of the classified [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=93.68s)]
*  and top secret documents not be available to Trump and his co-defendants for use at [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=97.8s)]
*  trial. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  In cases like this one that involve classified documents, a hearing is held before the trial [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  to determine what material can be available to the defense and how it can be referenced [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=107.48s)]
*  without harming national security. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=111.44s)]
*  In Trump's trial, the hearing is set for next month. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=113.64s)]
*  Depending on how Judge Cannon, a Trump appointee, rules, the government may appeal the decision. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=116.08s)]
*  A move that could delay the trial beyond its currently scheduled May start date. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=121.0s)]
*  Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=125.52000000000001s)]

*  Pentagon Press Secretary Pat Ryder says the U.S. does not want a wider war in the Middle [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=144.44s)]
*  East. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=149.4s)]
*  U.S. Central Command, of course, is taking this very seriously and we will take necessary [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=150.4s)]
*  measures and steps to ensure that our forces are protected, recognizing as well that this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=154.52s)]
*  is a dangerous neighborhood. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=159.8s)]
*  Iran has insisted it had nothing to do with the deadly attack and today Iran says it will [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=161.36s)]
*  decisively respond to any attack on its country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=166.04s)]
*  President Biden will help receive the bodies of the fallen U.S. soldiers this Friday at [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjzfTqgPUSU&t=169.55999999999997s)]
