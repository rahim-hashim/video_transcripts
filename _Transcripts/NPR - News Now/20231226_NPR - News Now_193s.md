# Netanyahu Lists Prerequisites For Peace In WSJ Op-Ed | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has identified prerequisites for peace with Gaza in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=0.0s)]
*  And hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied in New York City on Christmas Day. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=7.7s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  President Biden ordered U.S. airstrikes against three facilities in Iraq. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=17.2s)]
*  The facilities are used by a militia group that has ties to Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=21.6s)]
*  This follows drone strikes against U.S. sites in Iraq that left three U.S. service members wounded, one of them critically. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=25.7s)]
*  The Pentagon's Central Command says the U.S. strike destroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed a number of militants. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=32.8s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is listing his prerequisites for peace between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=40.5s)]
*  NPR's Jason DeRose reports from Tel Aviv. The Israeli leader published his list in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=48.5s)]
*  Netanyahu says for there to be peace, three things need to happen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=55.0s)]
*  First, Israel's military needs to destroy Hamas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=58.4s)]
*  Second, Gaza needs to be demilitarized as a whole. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=61.7s)]
*  And third, Palestinian society needs to be, in his words, deradicalized. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=65.0s)]
*  Netanyahu says in his op-ed piece that since Hamas has vowed to repeat attacks like the one on October 7th that left 1200 dead, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=70.3s)]
*  its military capabilities need to be dismantled and its political rule over Gaza must end. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=79.1s)]
*  He likens the possibility of what he calls a deradicalized Palestinian society to that of Germany and Japan after World War II, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=84.8s)]
*  noting that those countries are now allies of the U.S. and promote stability in Europe and Asia. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=92.89999999999999s)]

*  Harrison Malkin reports the protesters rallied at Rockefeller Center and in Union Square. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=106.9s)]

*  The protest comes after Christmas was called off in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Bethlehem, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=127.0s)]
*  the birthplace of Jesus, because of the devastating war where the Israeli military has killed over 20,000 Palestinians. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=132.6s)]

*  David Roth is a forecaster with the Weather Prediction Center. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=154.2s)]
*  He says people need to stay off the roads for safety. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  For the ones trying to travel, they just shouldn't. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=161.7s)]
*  Maybe evaluate as you go through the day. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=165.4s)]
*  The wind should be very slowly coming down today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=167.6s)]
*  So maybe tonight they'll be able to get out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=170.9s)]
*  But yeah, it doesn't look very good for this morning into this afternoon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=173.9s)]
*  The National Weather Service has posted blizzard warnings for several states from Nebraska to South Dakota. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTRgQ2X_dBE&t=179.0s)]
