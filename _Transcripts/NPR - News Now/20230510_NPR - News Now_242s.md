# N.Y. Rep. George Santos Faces Criminal Charges In Federal Court | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM)
*  As the standoff over the federal debt limit continues, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden says he's considered invoking the 14th Amendment to avoid default. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=2.9s)]
*  And pandemic-era border restrictions expire tomorrow night. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=7.7s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Cora Vick-Holman from NPR News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=11.5s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  President Biden says he's considered invoking the 14th Amendment [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=15.9s)]
*  to avoid a catastrophic default on the federal government's debt. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=19.2s)]
*  But NPR's Franco Ordoña reports Biden doesn't think there's enough time to litigate the matter. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=22.6s)]
*  Biden says the 14th Amendment could allow the U.S. government to keep making payments on the nation's debt. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=27.8s)]
*  But he expects the move would be challenged in the courts. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=33.5s)]
*  The problem is it would have to be litigated. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=36.5s)]
*  And in the meantime, without an extension, it would still end up in the same place. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=39.6s)]
*  Biden was speaking at the White House after meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  and other congressional leaders about the debt limit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=48.1s)]
*  He said he's willing to have a separate discussion with leaders about the budget and spending priorities. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=50.8s)]
*  But he said the threat of default must be removed from the table. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=56.1s)]
*  He also said he would not rule out a short-term extension of the debt limit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=59.8s)]
*  Franco Ordoñas, NPR News, The White House. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=63.9s)]
*  U.S. pandemic health rules expire tomorrow that allow border authorities to force out migrants coming into the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=67.1s)]
*  The rules are generally known as Title 42. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=73.7s)]
*  For months, governors in southern states have been sending migrants on buses to other northern cities, including to New York. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=76.5s)]
*  Now, New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will send migrants to other counties after they reach the city. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=83.3s)]
*  New York Governor Kathy Hochul says she is calling up the National Guard. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=89.5s)]
*  Well, we are in communication with the mayor's team and also helping him find locations within the city limits, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=93.3s)]
*  again, opening up state property and talking to other counties that are interested in having people come. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  The governor says she is using over $1 billion of New York's budget to help the state address the migrants' needs. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  The Texas House of Representatives has voted to expel Republican lawmaker Brian Slaton. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=112.4s)]
*  He is accused of having sex with a young legislative aide. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  The Texas newsroom Sergio Martinez Beltran has more. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=121.7s)]
*  The full Texas House chamber sat in silence as members read the report that found Brian Slaton in violation of the House rules. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  State Representative Ann Johnson, a Democrat from Houston, said Slaton's actions left members with no other choice than to vote for expulsion. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=132.3s)]
*  We are here because a 45-year-old member took advantage of and abused his power over his subordinate teenage staffer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=140.4s)]
*  A Texas House panel found that Slaton gave alcohol to his 19-year-old aide at his apartment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=149.6s)]
*  Afterwards, the report says he had sex with a staffer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=154.8s)]
*  Slaton is known for pushing for bills targeting members of the LGBTQ community. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=158.4s)]
*  The 45-year-old is also married. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sergio Martinez Beltran in Austin. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=166.3s)]
*  A jury in New York has found former President Donald Trump liable for battery and defamation in the sexual abuse civil lawsuit brought by writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=170.3s)]
*  Trump is vowing to appeal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=180.4s)]
*  The jury did not find enough evidence to say Trump had raped Carroll. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=182.4s)]
*  Trump has been ordered to pay her $5 million. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=186.60000000000002s)]

*  George Santos has been dogged by revelations that he lied about his background and engaged in questionable financial dealings before his election last year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=202.29999999999998s)]
*  Santos recently announced he would run for re-election, even though federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have been investigating him for months. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=211.5s)]
*  The criminal charges first reported by CNN could be unveiled as early as Wednesday. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=219.7s)]
*  The House Ethics Committee announced its own investigation of Santos this year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=225.4s)]
*  Santos has said he embellished his resume, but he's denied any criminal wrongdoing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyn2M39WvM&t=229.60000000000002s)]
