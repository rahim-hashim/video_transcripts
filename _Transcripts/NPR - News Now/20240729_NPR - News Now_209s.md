*  Electoral authorities claim that Venezuela's president has won a third term in office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9pQCjQJrk0&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Biden is calling on Congress to establish term limits and an enforceable [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9pQCjQJrk0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  ethics code for U.S. Supreme Court justices. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9pQCjQJrk0&t=9.8s)]

*  the opposition candidate 51 percent to 44 percent. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9pQCjQJrk0&t=28.08s)]
*  The Venezuelan opposition isn't buying that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9pQCjQJrk0&t=32.32s)]
