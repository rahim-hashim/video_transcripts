# Report: Dozens Of Israel's Detainees From Gaza Have Died In Custody | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, August 12th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=0.0s)]
*  are today's top stories. Hamas has implied that it won't be sending any representatives [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=5.3s)]
*  to new ceasefire talks for Gaza this week. Hamas says this comes after an Israeli airstrike [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=9.56s)]
*  this weekend that killed more than 90 people. A report from the Israeli military says several [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=14.66s)]
*  dozen detainees from Gaza have died while in military custody since the war with Hamas [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=19.78s)]
*  began more than 10 months ago. As NPR's Daniel Estrin reports, other Palestinians who were [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=24.54s)]
*  detained allege they were abused by Israeli forces. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=30.18s)]
*  An Israeli military report delivered to the Israeli group Physicians for Human Rights [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=33.62s)]
*  and reviewed by NPR says at least 44 Palestinians from Gaza have died in military detention [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=37.74s)]
*  since the war began. The Israeli military said some died from previous illnesses or [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=43.26s)]
*  injuries endured in the quote, ongoing hostilities, and that it investigates each death. Separately, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=47.94s)]
*  a doctor from Physicians for Human Rights in Israel observed the autopsy of a prisoner [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=53.86s)]
*  from the West Bank and said he died after being denied treatment for a disease. The [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=57.58s)]
*  military's detention practices are under scrutiny. A group of soldiers is being questioned on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=62.06s)]
*  suspicion of sexually assaulting a Gaza detainee. A medical official told NPR the detainee [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=66.48s)]
*  faced life-threatening injuries. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=71.74s)]
*  Vice President Harris and her running mate Tim Walz have concluded a multi-state campaign [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=76.14s)]
*  trip over the past week. They finished with a donor event last night in San Francisco [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=80.8s)]
*  where Harris was once a prosecutor. Harris and former President Donald Trump don't have [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=85.96s)]
*  many policy points in common, especially on economics, but over the weekend in Nevada, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  Harris joined Trump in supporting tax-free tips. NPR's Luke Garrett explains. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=95.72s)]
*  Both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees support no taxes on tips. And in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=101.52s)]
*  Congress, two bills are making their way through Capitol Hill to make the idea law. But senior [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=106.36s)]
*  fellow at the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center, Steve Rosenthal, isn't buying it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=111.32s)]
*  Not so much a united front, but a race to the bottom would be a better way to describe [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=115.64s)]
*  tax policy here. Rosenthal says the no tax on tips policy, while politically attractive, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=120.68s)]
*  creates more problems than solutions. How are we going to tell who is receiving a tip [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=126.48s)]
*  and when that tip crosses the line into wages? How will we prevent investment bankers, say, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=132.16s)]
*  from getting tips? But the nail in the coffin for this tax-free tips idea is revenue. Rosenthal [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=138.64s)]
*  estimates Congress would lose around $100 billion in 10 years. Luke Garrett, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=144.6s)]
*  Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance gave several interviews yesterday to major networks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  He blasted Vice President Harris' campaign for criticizing him on his policy positions for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=157.24s)]
*  families. The Harris campaign has frankly lied about what I actually said. I'm pro-family. I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=162.84s)]
*  want us to have more families. And obviously sometimes it doesn't work out, sometimes for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=168.56s)]
*  medical reasons, sometimes because you don't meet the right person. But the point is that our country [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  has become anti-family in its public policy. He spoke to ABC's This Week. This is NPR. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G29IIDx3fA&t=177.24s)]
