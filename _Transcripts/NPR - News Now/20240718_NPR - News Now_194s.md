# Vance Accepts GOP's Vice Presidential Nomination | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY)
*  Donald Trump is expected to accept the GOP presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=0.0s)]
*  And special counsel Jack Smith says he is appealing a decision to dismiss federal charges against Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=6.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Tonight's the final night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=17.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is expected to accept the GOP presidential nomination this evening. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=20.8s)]
*  Last night, his running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, accepted the GOP vice presidential nomination. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=25.2s)]
*  In his speech, Vance criticized President Biden for being a career politician. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=31.2s)]
*  Joe Biden has been a politician in Washington for longer than I've been alive. 39 years old. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=35.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris is not much further behind. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=41.2s)]
*  For half a century, he's been the champion of every major policy initiative to make America weaker and poorer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=45.2s)]
*  Other convention speakers last night included Donald Trump's family and Texas Republican Congressman Ronnie Jackson. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=53.2s)]
*  He previously served as Trump's doctor while he was in the White House. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=59.2s)]
*  Jackson says Trump is fit to serve. He says President Biden is not up to the task. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=62.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Biden is off the campaign trail. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=68.2s)]
*  He was campaigning in Las Vegas yesterday when he reported feeling unwell. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=70.2s)]
*  He then tested positive for the coronavirus. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=74.2s)]
*  The White House says he has got very mild COVID symptoms. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=77.2s)]
*  Biden has returned to his home in Delaware to recuperate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=80.2s)]
*  Special Counsel Jack Smith is appealing a federal judge's decision to dismiss charges that former President Donald Trump concealed secret government documents at his Florida estate. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=83.2s)]
*  And Pierce Greg Allen has more. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=94.2s)]
*  The special counsel notified U.S. District Judge Eileen Cannon that he's preparing to appeal her ruling to the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=96.2s)]
*  That notice comes two days after Cannon ruled the appointment of the special counsel was unconstitutional [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=103.2s)]
*  and she dismissed the 38 felony counts facing Trump and his two co-defendants. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=108.2s)]
*  Smith can ask the appeals court to take the case on an expedited basis. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=112.2s)]
*  It did so two years ago in a related matter involving Trump and a search conducted at Mar-a-Lago by the FBI. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=116.2s)]
*  In that case, the 11th Circuit moved quickly and filed an opinion less than three months later reversing Judge Cannon's ruling. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=122.2s)]
*  Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=128.2s)]
*  Haiti's new prime minister has declared a state of emergency in the parts of that country controlled by gangs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=130.2s)]
*  NPR's Adr Peralta reports the Haitian leader is warning of a long battle against the gangs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=136.2s)]
*  The prime minister, Gary Conneal, spoke on national television. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=141.2s)]
*  Conneal said the state of emergency would take effect in 14 gang-controlled communes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=151.2s)]
*  He also said the decree would give Haiti the tools it needed to combat the gangs, which have thrown the country into chaos. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=156.2s)]
*  Conneal asked the gangs to lay down their weapons and accept the authority of the state. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=163.2s)]
*  About 400 Kenyan police officers have deployed to Haiti as part of an international effort to help the Haitian national police fight the gangs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=167.2s)]
*  The prime minister warned the process will not be easy, but the objective is to regain control of the whole territory, going house by house, neighborhood by neighborhood. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=176.2s)]
*  Adr Peralta, NPR News, Mexico City. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuAUQlwmFjY&t=185.2s)]
