*  Opponents say the law is unconstitutional because the federal government has the sole [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCvJg2YydM&t=140.14s)]
*  authority to enforce immigration laws, but Texas Republicans, including Governor Greg [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZCvJg2YydM&t=143.85999999999999s)]
