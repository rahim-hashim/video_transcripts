*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, Biden suggests he's only running for re-election because of Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=21.12s)]
*  Speaking at a fundraiser outside of Boston, Biden went a little off script towards the end, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=26.8s)]
*  saying quote, if Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running, but we cannot let him win [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  for the sake of the country. Asked later on the South Lawn of the White House whether he would [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  be running if Trump wasn't, Biden dialed it back. I expect so, but look, he is running and I just, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=43.6s)]
*  I have to run. No, not now. Biden often talks about Trump when he explains why he came out [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=50.88s)]

*  by Leader McConnell. The first question, instead of asking our panelists, he called on Langford [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  to give a five-minute talk about the negotiations on border and that wasn't the purpose of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=97.6s)]
*  meeting at all. But Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney says Democrats just don't get it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  We agree Ukraine needs the money and it's in America's interest to get the money to help [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=109.44s)]
*  Ukraine. But we also recognize that the president put border security on the table as part of this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=113.2s)]
*  supplemental and unless they're willing to shut down the 10,000 a day being released into the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=118.56s)]
*  country, they're not going to get a deal done. President Biden warns that USAID to Ukraine runs [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=124.96s)]

*  in the use of statins among people who are eligible due to high cholesterol or other risk [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=165.04s)]
*  factors that put them at high risk. That leveling off has even happened as statins have become more [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=170.48s)]
*  affordable and so that leveling off is quite surprising. Anderson says statins are among the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=176.0s)]
*  best tool in the toolkit to prevent heart attacks and strokes and people can talk to their health [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz0-QFI495w&t=180.79999999999998s)]
