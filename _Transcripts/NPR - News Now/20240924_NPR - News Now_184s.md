# Hundreds Killed In Israel's Strikes On Southern Lebanon | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, September 24th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=3.0s)]
*  Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon continue to trade fire. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=7.0s)]
*  The Lebanese Health Ministry now says two days of Israeli airstrikes have killed 558 people in Lebanon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=12.0s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=18.0s)]
*  Israel carried out more than 1,300 airstrikes on Monday, followed by several more overnight, mostly in southern Lebanon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=21.0s)]
*  It said the airstrikes took out Hezbollah munitions, including long-range cruise missiles aimed at Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=27.0s)]
*  In just one day, those strikes killed almost 500 people in Lebanon, including at least 35 children, according to Lebanese health officials. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=32.0s)]
*  More than 1,600 were wounded. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Hezbollah in turn barraged Israel with more than 250 rockets shot deeper into the country than it has in almost a year of conflict. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=43.0s)]
*  Most were intercepted midair, although some damage was reported, including at a regional hospital in northern Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=50.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel has continued to issue warnings urging civilians in southern Lebanon to flee, saying it has not ruled out a possible ground invasion into Lebanese territory. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=56.0s)]
*  Kat Lonsdorf, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=65.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump held a rally in eastern Pennsylvania yesterday. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=68.0s)]
*  He told supporters that if he is elected, he would protect American women and that they will be happy and free. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=72.0s)]
*  You will no longer be thinking about abortion. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=79.0s)]
*  It's all they talk about, abortion, because we've done something that nobody else could have done. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=82.0s)]
*  It is now where it always had to be, with the states, and they vote of the people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=89.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris is speaking of abortion rights and wants to reestablish protections from the Supreme Court's overturned Roe decision. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=95.0s)]
*  She says the Senate could start by ending its filibuster rule. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=103.0s)]
*  I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=107.0s)]
*  and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=121.0s)]
*  She spoke to Wisconsin Public Radio. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Aircraft maker Boeing says it's made its best and final offer to tens of thousands of striking machinists. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=131.0s)]
*  The unionized workers walked off the job more than a week ago. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=137.0s)]
*  From member station KUOW in Seattle, Casey Martin reports Boeing also set a deadline. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=141.0s)]
*  The proposed contract has a 30 percent wage hike, up 5 percent from Boeing's last offer. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=147.0s)]
*  But that may not be enough. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=153.0s)]
*  Striking machinists say they need a 40 percent raise to afford to live in the area. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=155.0s)]
*  Boeing says this is the company's best and final offer. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=160.0s)]
*  It also includes the reinstatement of a performance bonus and an improvement in retirement benefits. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=164.0s)]
*  Boeing has given union members until Friday night to ratify it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=170.0s)]
*  The union says it is reviewing the deal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=174.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Casey Martin in Seattle. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=176.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P815TQH61VQ&t=179.0s)]
