*  Congress is working toward a critical deadline to pass a bill that would keep the federal government open past September 30th. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSG7WriRYU&t=117.0s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston tells us House Republicans have unveiled a stopgap funding measure [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSG7WriRYU&t=125.0s)]

*  The Fed has raised rates sharply over the last year and a half. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSG7WriRYU&t=171.0s)]
*  That's because it is still trying to get inflation down to its target rate of 2 percent. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLSG7WriRYU&t=176.0s)]
