# Netanyahu Tells NPR Israel Is Responsible For Gaza 'For The Foreseeable Future' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells NPR Israel's military will be responsible for security in Gaza for the foreseeable future. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=0.0s)]
*  And the UAW has ratified a new contract with one of Detroit's big three automakers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=7.92s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=12.72s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Israeli military is going to continue fighting Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=17.52s)]
*  In an exclusive interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Netanyahu says Israel is going to root out Hamas as a ruling entity. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=23.92s)]
*  But once we defeat Hamas, we have to make sure that there's no new Hamas, no resurgence of terrorism. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  And right now the only force that is able to secure that is Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=38.08s)]
*  So for the foreseeable future, Israeli overall military responsibility. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=42.32000000000001s)]
*  But there also has to be a civilian government there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  But Netanyahu would not say who he thinks should run the civilian government for the Palestinian enclave. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=49.6s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister also says Israeli troops remain in the largest hospital in Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=56.0s)]
*  He says the Israeli military has found a lot of Hamas weapons, a lot of ammunition and bombs at Al-Shifa Hospital. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=61.36s)]
*  The situation remains dire in Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=68.32s)]
*  Palestinian health authorities say Israeli attacks have killed more than 11,000 people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=71.04s)]
*  The UN says some 2,700 people, including 1,500 children, remain missing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=76.72s)]
*  They're believed to be buried under the rubble of buildings destroyed in Israeli airstrikes. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=82.4s)]
*  All telecommunications are down in Gaza because Israel has blocked nearly all fuel from entering the enclave. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=87.36s)]
*  President Biden wraps up his trip to San Francisco today with a meeting with Mexico's president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Tamara Keith has more. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=99.44s)]
*  Biden is set to sit down with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=101.84s)]
*  It's the last big sit down on the president's schedule during his time in San Francisco. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, he held a trilateral meeting with the leaders of Japan and South Korea. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=115.44s)]
*  That alliance, as well as economic development announcements with Indo-Pacific nations, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  are all part of the Biden administration's effort to counter China's influence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News, San Francisco. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=129.60000000000002s)]
*  United Auto Workers have voted in favor of new contracts with Detroit automakers. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=132.0s)]
*  About 55% of members at GM have backed the deal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=136.16000000000003s)]
*  NPR's Camila Dominovski reports UAW members at Ford and Stellantis are on track to win by larger margins. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=139.84s)]
*  The union's president, Sean Fain, told members he thought these deals with the big three were as good as he could get, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=148.24s)]
*  with raises of at least 25%, cost of living increases, and boosts to retirement contributions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=154.4s)]
*  The question was whether it was enough for union members. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=160.24s)]
*  And that was a real question. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Some big plants voted against the contracts, with members arguing the union could get even more, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  like winning back health care for retirees or more time off. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=171.76s)]
*  But ultimately, it appears members are voting to lock in these gains, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=175.28s)]
*  which means companies can finalize their production plans, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=179.12s)]
*  and the union can forge ahead with its plan to try to expand into non-union plants. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Camila Dominovski, NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2XQKfOOSo&t=188.16s)]
