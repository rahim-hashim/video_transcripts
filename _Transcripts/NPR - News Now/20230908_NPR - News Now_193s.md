# Hong Kong Inundated By Floodwaters From Historic Rainfall | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ)
*  A former adviser to former President Donald Trump has been convicted on criminal charges [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of contempt of Congress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=5.2s)]
*  And record rainfalls swept across Hong Kong and parts of southern China on Thursday night. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=6.84s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=11.5s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=12.5s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=14.16s)]
*  President Biden arrives in New Delhi in a few hours to attend the Group of 20 summit. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=16.98s)]
*  India holds the rotating G20 presidency this year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=21.92s)]
*  And India is looking to prove itself as a world leader. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=25.6s)]
*  But Sushmita Patak reports on New Delhi. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=28.8s)]
*  Some of the preparations have drawn criticism. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=31.32s)]
*  New Delhi has gotten a makeover in recent weeks, with decorative lights and water fountains [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=33.96s)]
*  embellishing its streets. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Posters about the G20 are on every corner. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=40.2s)]
*  But as the city gears up to welcome world leaders, officials have evicted slum dwellers [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=43.28s)]
*  and removed hawkers and beggars from the streets. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=47.92s)]
*  Green sheets pitched on wooden poles along key roads hide the homeless from view. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  This has prompted criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups, who say [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=55.76s)]
*  India wants to be a voice for the global south but is hiding its own problems with poverty. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=60.04s)]
*  The summit is also expected to inconvenience Delhi residents. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=65.4s)]
*  Food delivery is barred in many parts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=69.08s)]
*  Traffic is heavily restricted. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=71.4s)]
*  And dozens of trains and flights have been cancelled. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=73.2s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sushmita Patak in Delhi. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=75.9s)]
*  Former Trump aide Peter Navarro has been convicted on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=79.24s)]
*  He was charged with defying a subpoena from the House Select Committee investigating the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=84.7s)]
*  January 6th insurrection. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=88.7s)]
*  NPR's Dustin Joan reports Navarro could spend up to two years behind bars. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=90.7s)]
*  It took less than four hours for a federal jury to issue a guilty verdict after only [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=96.12s)]
*  hearing from three witnesses, none of whom came from the defense. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=100.54s)]
*  After the verdict was issued, Peter Navarro said he would be exonerated. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=104.78s)]
*  I am willing to go to prison to settle this issue. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=108.34s)]
*  I'm willing to do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=114.62s)]
*  But I also know that the likelihood of me going to prison is relatively small because [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=116.54s)]
*  we are right on this issue. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  Navarro had tried to have the charges dismissed, citing executive privilege, but a judge ruled [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=125.9s)]
*  against that argument last week. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=130.54s)]
*  He is the second former Trump aide to be convicted for failing to cooperate with a congressional [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=132.74s)]
*  subpoena. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=136.78s)]
*  Dustin Jones, NPR News. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=138.26s)]
*  Flash floods caused by unprecedented rain and downpours have caused widespread disruption [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=140.7s)]
*  in Hong Kong and in parts of southern China. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aGsDW_AOrQ&t=146.61999999999998s)]
