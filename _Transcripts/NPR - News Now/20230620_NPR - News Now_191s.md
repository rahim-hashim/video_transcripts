# Search Continues For Missing Titanic Tours Sub | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4)
*  The search continues for a submersible that went missing on a trip to visit the wreckage of the Titanic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=0.0s)]
*  And today is the final day of voting in Virginia's primary election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=5.86s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=9.78s)]
*  There's a search and rescue operation underway in the North Atlantic Ocean for a missing submersible vehicle. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=14.06s)]
*  Dan Karpanchuk reports it failed to check in Sunday after it began an excursion to see the wreck of the Titanic. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=19.6s)]
*  The US Coast Guard says surface crews lost contact with the submersible less than two hours after it descended into a remote area of the ocean [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  after having left St. John's, Newfoundland on Sunday morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=33.24s)]
*  US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger says Sunday afternoon they were notified that the submersible was overdue. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=36.36s)]
*  There were five people on board. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=42.24s)]
*  He says US and Canadian aircraft are searching the area with radar and sonar buoys, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=43.94s)]
*  and vessels from both countries have been dispatched. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=48.7s)]
*  The infamous wreck is located about 360 miles southeast of Newfoundland. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=51.46s)]
*  The Titan can provide oxygen and life support for up to 96 hours. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=56.08s)]
*  Experts say the biggest challenge will be the submersible's depth. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=60.2s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Dan Karpanchuk in Toronto. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=63.44s)]
*  Today's the final day of voting in Virginia's primary election. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=66.24s)]
*  Republicans took control of the lower state house two years ago, and Republican Glenn Youngkin became Virginia governor. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  From member station WAMU, Margaret Bartel says the primary results could affect Youngkin, who has had some key wins in the Virginia legislature. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  One of the biggest is a big tax cut that he got through in the budget deal last year. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=85.5s)]
*  But because Democrats have control of the state senate, they've been able to block a lot of the stuff on Youngkin's agenda. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=90.0s)]
*  Think things like a 15-week abortion ban and school choice legislation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  And so for someone who's kind of flirting with presidential ambitions like Youngkin is, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=102.0s)]
*  not getting those cultural conservative wins is a bit of a problem. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=107.0s)]
*  Margaret Bartel reporting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=110.74s)]
*  New research suggests police drug busts may actually increase the number of overdoses experienced by people with addiction. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=112.82s)]
*  NPR's Brian Mann reports the study comes as policymakers debate how to respond to surging overdose deaths. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=120.82s)]
*  The peer-reviewed study focused on streets in Indianapolis, Indiana. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=128.32s)]
*  After police conducted raids on dealers selling methamphetamines and fentanyl, overdoses rose sharply. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=132.32s)]
*  Dr. Jennifer Carroll is one of the lead authors. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=138.82s)]
*  Overdoses in the community, both fatal and non-fatal, were increasing after local law enforcement seized drugs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=140.9s)]
*  With opioids, we saw overdoses double. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=148.4s)]
*  Carroll says one theory is that after police raids, people with addiction wind up buying drugs from dealers they don't know, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=151.4s)]
*  who are selling fentanyl with different potency. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=157.9s)]
*  Researchers say after 110,000 drug deaths last year, more study is needed to determine if raids wind up doing more harm than good. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=160.4s)]
*  Brian Mann, NPR News. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=168.4s)]
*  More than a quarter million people are still without power in the central and southern U.S. due to powerful storms. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  More than 150,000 customers are in the dark in Oklahoma. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Mississippi has had tornadoes over the past two days. A tornado on Sunday left one person dead. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRJk6dOD1T4&t=180.48000000000002s)]
