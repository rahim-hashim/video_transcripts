# Tropical Storm Debby Bringing Torrential Rains To Georgia, S.C. | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM)
*  Vice President Harris is expected to introduce a running mate today at a campaign event in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=0.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=4.98s)]
*  And U.S. stock futures are pointing toward a modest rebound this morning after yesterday's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=6.22s)]
*  steep losses. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=10.38s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=11.38s)]
*  I'm Cora VaColeman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=12.38s)]
*  The center of tropical storm Debbie is moving over Georgia and back out to the Atlantic [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Ocean, but its bands are soaking much of the southeast. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=20.36s)]
*  Forecasters say the storm could linger for several days over parts of South Carolina [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=24.22s)]
*  and Georgia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=28.34s)]
*  South Carolina Public Radio's Victoria Hansen reports from Charleston. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=29.34s)]
*  Potentially catastrophic is how the National Weather Service in Charleston is describing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=33.26s)]
*  the amount of rainfall expected, anywhere from 10 to 20 inches, especially along the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=37.7s)]
*  coast. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=42.86s)]
*  Couple the rain with high tides and an anticipated storm surge of 2 to 4 feet pushing on shore, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=44.06s)]
*  and all that water has little place to go. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=49.66s)]
*  Charleston's mayor is so concerned about flash flooding he enacted a curfew last night, essentially [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  closing the peninsula until officials can reassess the danger later. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=58.02s)]
*  A tornado did touch down overnight in a beachside community just south of Charleston. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=62.34s)]
*  State and local leaders are urging people to stay home. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=67.26s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Victoria Hansen in Charleston, South Carolina. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=71.22s)]
*  Stock futures are suggesting they'll open higher this morning on Wall Street. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  That follows yesterday's 1,000-point loss by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=79.9s)]
*  According to the U.S. economy, the U.S. economy could face a recession later this year, and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=85.66s)]
*  many wanted policymakers for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates last week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=90.74s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=96.1s)]
*  That disappointed Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandi. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  I do think they should start cutting interest rates. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  I think they're late to the game. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=102.38s)]
*  I think they've misjudged the slowdown in the economy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=103.74s)]
*  They put their foot on the brakes and they need to start taking them off and allowing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=106.78s)]
*  the economy to grow more quickly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=110.74s)]
*  So yeah, I think they need to start cutting rates. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=112.86s)]
*  At the September meeting, I'd be very surprised if they don't cut rates and they don't cut [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=114.94s)]
*  rates aggressively. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's Morning Edition. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  There's anticipation over who Vice President Harris will choose as her running mate for [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  the Democratic presidential ticket. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  She's scheduled to appear with her choice later today at a rally in Philadelphia. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=128.22s)]
*  There's less than two weeks to go before the start of the Democratic National Convention [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=133.14s)]
*  in Chicago. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=137.88s)]
*  At member station WBEZ, Michael Puente reports activists are at odds with the city over where [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=139.24s)]
*  they can march during the event. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  A coalition of pro-Palestinian groups say thousands will descend on Chicago and they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=147.44s)]
*  plan to march near the United Center where much of the convention will take place. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  The city is limiting a protest route to just one mile in length, about two blocks from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  the stadium. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=163.68s)]
*  During a federal court hearing Monday in Chicago, the coalition spokesman Hatem Abu [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=165.36s)]
*  Daya says that's not enough and wants the city to double it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=170.9s)]
*  Absolutely there will be tens of thousands of people, especially if there's an expanded [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=176.0s)]
*  war. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=182.68s)]
*  A federal judge is expected to make a ruling by next week. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=183.68s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Michael Puente in Chicago. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=188.08s)]
*  Today is the 79th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=191.8s)]
*  in World War II. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=197.62s)]
*  Bells tolled in the city in honor of the 140,000 people killed in that attack. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=204.52s)]
*  After the U.S. used an atomic weapon to destroy the city of Nagasaki, three days later, Japan [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  surrendered and the war in the Pacific theater ended. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  It began there when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=219.94s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkcQRq5_BCM&t=225.46s)]
