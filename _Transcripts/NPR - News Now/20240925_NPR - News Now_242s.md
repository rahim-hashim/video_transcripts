*  restraint. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=72.68s)]

*  home in Sarasota. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=108.4s)]
*  He still hasn't moved back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=110.0s)]

*  nothing will happen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=115.12s)]
*  Flooding again is a big concern, says Ian Allen, whose home also flooded during Debbie. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=116.6s)]
*  Our drainage ditches are pretty full, so they haven't been cleaned out yet to be completely [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=122.0s)]
*  honest with you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=126.0s)]

*  innocent. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=143.6s)]

*  the prosecutor's office had filed a motion to vacate the man's conviction. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=149.32s)]
*  St. Louis Public Radio's Rachel Lippen has followed the case. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=153.4s)]

*  a laptop that belonged to her husband. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=173.3s)]
*  The conviction was based largely on the testimony of a former girlfriend and a jailhouse informant. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=175.74s)]
*  Rachel Lippen reporting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=180.82s)]
*  Testing on the knife used as the murder weapon revealed the DNA on it likely belonged to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=182.46s)]
*  two former employees of the prosecutor's office who handled it, not Williams. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caNZhFlEfw4&t=186.88s)]
