# Congress Certifies Election Results Today 4 Years After Attack | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, January 6th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=3.0s)]
*  Later today, Congress will certify President-elect Trump's victory in last year's election. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=7.0s)]
*  Four years ago today, a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in failed effort to keep him in power. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=12.0s)]
*  NPR's Tom Dreisbach says afterwards, hundreds of rioters were put on trial. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=18.0s)]
*  Most defendants pleaded guilty. The people that went to trial were virtually all convicted by juries or, in some cases, by judges. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=22.0s)]
*  And as these prosecutions have gone on, the facts that emerged have only been more alarming. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=29.0s)]
*  We've seen more videos of violence. We learned more people had weapons like guns, bats, tasers, pepper spray. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=33.0s)]
*  But as Trump ran for president again, he embraced this idea that the violence on January 6th was overblown. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=39.0s)]
*  He claimed there were no guns, which is not true. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=45.0s)]
*  And he claimed to supporters that most got a little out of hand, that they've been unjustly prosecuted, in his view. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=48.0s)]
*  NPR's Tom Dreisbach reporting. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=53.0s)]
*  A major winter storm is blasting parts of the central and eastern U.S. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=56.0s)]
*  Winter storm cautions are posted from Arkansas to New Jersey. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=60.0s)]
*  President Biden is banning new offshore oil and gas drilling along major areas of the east and west coasts of the U.S., [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=64.0s)]
*  as well as the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the northern Bering Sea off Alaska. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=71.0s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brady reports Biden says the move is part of his effort to address climate change. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=76.0s)]
*  President Biden is issuing protections from future drilling for more than 625 million acres of coastline. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=82.0s)]
*  The oil industry has not shown a lot of interest in these areas. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=88.0s)]
*  Still, the American Petroleum Institute criticized the move and urged Republicans to do all they can to reverse it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=91.0s)]
*  That's more difficult because the protections were issued under a 1950s law that gives presidents wide latitude to issue such protections. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=97.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump has vowed to deregulate oil and gas drilling to boost production, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=106.0s)]
*  even though the U.S. already produces more oil than any country ever. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=110.0s)]
*  The environmental group Oceana praised the protections, saying many coastal communities don't want new offshore drilling. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=114.0s)]
*  Jeff Brady, NPR News. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=120.0s)]
*  Syria's foreign minister has called on the U.S. to lift sanctions imposed on his country that were to punish the former Assad regime. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=122.0s)]
*  He says they're punishing poor Syrians. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=130.0s)]
*  NPR's Diye Hadid reports from Damascus. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=132.0s)]
*  Syria's foreign minister, Asaad Hassan al-Shaybani, spoke during a visit to the Gulf state of Qatar, which has been aiding the new interim government. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=136.0s)]
*  It's headed by Ahmad al-Sharah since his rebels overran Damascus in early December, toppling the decades-old Assad regime. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=144.0s)]
*  The Syrian interim government has repeatedly called on the U.S. to lift sanctions that were imposed to punish the Assad regime. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=151.0s)]
*  They say they urgently need aid to flow to Syrians, most of whom live in poverty. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=159.0s)]
*  There's also an urgent need for reconstruction after the former regime flattened swaths of major cities in its quest to destroy rebels opposed to its rule. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=164.0s)]
*  That call to lift sanctions has also been echoed by senior foreign policy analysts on Syria. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=173.0s)]
*  Diye Hadid, NPR News, Damascus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=179.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLYPEfMwmY&t=182.0s)]
