# Trump Taps RFK Jr. To 'Make America Healthy Again' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k)
*  President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=0.0s)]
*  to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=3.18s)]
*  And an appellate court's decision is expected next month [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=5.78s)]
*  in a case that could help decide the future of TikTok in the U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=8.68s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=15.22s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump says he'll nominate Robert F. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=17.18s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services secretary. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=19.62s)]
*  Kennedy is a vaccine skeptic known for spreading false information about them. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=22.6s)]
*  NPR Stephen Fowler reports Trump says [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=27.14s)]
*  Kennedy will help deal with the health crisis the U.S. faces. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=29.4s)]
*  If he's confirmed by the Senate, the role gives Kennedy the chance to actualize a vision [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=32.76s)]
*  that's often at odds with mainstream health and science, likely through a combination of scaling [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  back existing programs and refocusing others to align with his quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=41.54s)]
*  make America healthy again goals. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=45.78s)]
*  He told NPR that the government isn't going to take away vaccines from anybody, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=48.54s)]
*  but said the science on vaccine safety has huge deficits. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=53.16s)]
*  Now, vaccine experts disagree with that assessment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  NPR Stephen Fowler reporting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  The war between Israel and the militant Lebanese group Hezbollah has caused Lebanon more than eight billion dollars. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=61.64s)]
*  That's according to a new World Bank report on a country already suffering a long running financial crisis. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Jane Araf reports from Beirut. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=74.0s)]
*  The Lebanese government says almost three thousand four hundred people have been killed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  in Israeli airstrikes since the war began, many of them women and children. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=81.14s)]
*  And now the World Bank has detailed economic losses. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=85.56s)]
*  It says physical damage to buildings amounts to three point four billion dollars, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  while overall economic losses have topped more than five billion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  The biggest impact has been on housing with almost one hundred thousand apartments and houses damaged or destroyed, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  as well as leaving almost a million people displaced. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  The bank estimates that at least one hundred and sixty six thousand people have lost their jobs, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=109.2s)]
*  leaving many with nowhere to live and no income. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  Jane Araf and Pair News Beirut. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=119.68s)]
*  A new U.S. law is set to take effect in January that would ban the video sharing app TikTok. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=122.28s)]
*  That's unless TikTok's parent company based in China sells it off. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=128.18s)]
*  Supporters of the law say the TikTok ban is needed because of longstanding national security concerns involving China. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=132.78s)]
*  But NPR's Windsor Johnston reports TikTok's appeal of the U.S. law is moving forward. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  An appeals court is expected to rule by December 6th on a lawsuit filed by TikTok that challenges the ban. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  Damien Rolison, a social media marketing expert, says the platform has made strong arguments. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=153.26s)]
*  The ruling could give the Supreme Court more time to consider the appeal before the law goes into effect in January. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=162.42s)]
*  However, the incoming attorney general could also decide not to enforce the law. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=168.28s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=173.77999999999997s)]

*  We're going to talk about the U.S. law. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. law is a law that is not in effect. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NPViBN0p3k&t=182.01999999999998s)]
