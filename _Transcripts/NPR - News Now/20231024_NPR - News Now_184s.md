**NPR - News Now:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E)
*  Good morning. Today is Tuesday, October 24th. I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=0.0s)]
*  An elderly woman taken hostage by Hamas says she went through a nightmare and is relieved to be free. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=7.0s)]
*  NPR's Peter Kenyon reports her release comes as the Israeli military continues to attack Hamas positions in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=13.0s)]
*  Eighty-five-year-old Jochav Edlifshitz spoke outside the Tel Aviv hospital where she's being treated. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=20.0s)]
*  She said she was taken on a motorcycle as they raced away and was hit with a wooden pole. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=25.0s)]
*  Her watch and jewelry were stolen. After a long walk through underground tunnels, she said they came to a hall where they were guarded. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=29.0s)]
*  She said it seemed like Hamas, quote, prepared for this for a long time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=36.0s)]
*  The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza says nearly 5,800 people have been killed thus far, including more than 2,300 children. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=40.0s)]
*  Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Jerusalem. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=47.0s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron is visiting Israel. He met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=50.0s)]
*  who warns Israel's fight against Hamas is a battle with which the West must also engage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=56.0s)]
*  The test for the West and for civilization is Hamas. If Hamas emerges victorious, we will all lose. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=62.0s)]
*  Europe will be endangered. Everyone will be endangered. Civilization will be endangered. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=72.0s)]
*  Macron expressed solidarity with Israel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=77.0s)]
*  The fight against terrorism is obviously a matter of existence for Israel, but it's a matter of existence for all of us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=80.0s)]
*  Macron is calling on the international coalition fighting ISIS to also include fighting Hamas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=87.0s)]
*  Very limited amounts of relief aid are entering Gaza. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=93.0s)]
*  Nearly 60 trucks with water, food and medicine have gotten into the enclave in the past few days. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=96.0s)]
*  Many have been delayed in Egypt, waiting for permission to cross. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=102.0s)]
*  Israel continues to maintain its blockade of Gaza. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=105.0s)]
*  It means a cutoff of fuel needed to power water pumps and hospitals. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=108.0s)]
*  House Republicans will meet behind closed doors today to try again to nominate a speaker. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=113.0s)]
*  NPR's Susan Davis reports there are now eight candidates in the race. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=118.0s)]
*  Majority Whip Tom Emmer enters the race with the strongest initial position to win. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=122.0s)]
*  The Minnesota representative is the number three elected Republican in leadership, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=126.0s)]
*  and prior to that ran the House Republicans campaign operation when the party won the majority in the 2022 midterms. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=130.0s)]
*  But current leaders have struggled in this speaker fight, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=137.0s)]
*  and Emmer is not as close of an ally to former President Donald Trump as some of his colleagues would like. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=140.0s)]
*  Also running, Mike Johnson of Louisiana. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=145.0s)]
*  He's also in leadership and has close ties with party base activists. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=148.0s)]
*  Georgia's Austin Scott is making a second run for the job, and Florida's Byron Donalds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=151.0s)]
*  Donalds is a junior lawmaker, but part of the Freedom Caucus and would be the first black speaker if elected. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=156.0s)]
*  Susan Davis, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=162.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is expected to return to his civil fraud trial in New York today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=164.0s)]
*  A key witness is his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=169.0s)]
*  Trump's denied allegations that he wrongly inflated the value of some of his properties. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=172.0s)]
*  Cohen is expected to testify against him. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=177.0s)]
*  This is NPR News. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCJJG5xby0E&t=181.0s)]
