# Trump Marks Black History Month While Gutting Diversity Programs | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0)
*  Mexico's president is warning the U.S. not to invade our sovereignty in the U.S.'s fight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=0.0s)]
*  against drug cartels. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=5.92s)]
*  And federal judges rule the Trump administration can proceed with mass firings of federal workers. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=7.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=13.56s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=14.56s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron is coming to Washington Monday to meet President Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=17.72s)]
*  Macron has already gathered European leaders in Paris to discuss next steps for Ukraine [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  as it fights off Russia's attacks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=27.04s)]
*  President Trump has falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=29.76s)]
*  Next week marks the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=33.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Mike Walz says President Trump is irritated with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for not helping bring about a quick end to the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  war. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=47.56s)]
*  President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelensky, the fact [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=48.56s)]
*  that he hasn't come to the table, that he hasn't been willing to take this opportunity [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=54.28s)]
*  that we have offered. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=62.92s)]
*  Walz also criticized Ukraine for insults against President Trump. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=68.4s)]
*  Trump has described Zelensky as a dictator. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=73.12s)]
*  Mexico's president is warning the United States against any invasion of its territory. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=76.36s)]
*  Juan Piers Eder Peralta reports this comes as the U.S. has designated six Mexican cartels [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=81.68s)]
*  as terrorist groups. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. now considers some of Mexico's biggest organized crime groups terrorists. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Mexican President Claudio Sheinbaum said this was a decision the U.S. took unilaterally. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=93.44s)]
*  She said Mexico, like the U.S., is committed to fighting drug cartels, but through cooperation, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  not coercion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  This designation, she said, cannot be used by the U.S. as an opportunity to undermine [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=108.64s)]
*  our sovereignty. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=113.52s)]
*  Sheinbaum then proposed changes to the Mexican constitution that explicitly say the Mexican [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=114.84s)]
*  people reject foreign interventions or violation of Mexico's territory by land, sea or air. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=119.76s)]
*  President Trump has floated the idea of bombing the Mexican drug cartels. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=126.32s)]
*  Eder Peralta, MPR News, Mexico City. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=130.52s)]
*  A federal judge won't stop the Trump administration from firing thousands of government workers. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=132.96s)]
*  The judge said he did not have jurisdiction over a lawsuit federal employee unions filed [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=137.92s)]
*  to block it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=143.2s)]
*  This comes as Energy Secretary Chris Wright says it was a mistake for the administration [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=144.44s)]
*  to fire more than 100 federal employees. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=149.0s)]
*  MPR's Jeff Brumfield reports they're responsible for maintaining the nation's nuclear stockpile. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=152.2s)]
*  In an interview with Scripps News, Wright said the decision to fire employees at the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=158.11999999999998s)]
*  National Nuclear Security Administration was done in haste. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  I probably moved a little too quickly there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=165.64s)]
*  And when we made mistakes on layoffs in NNSA, we reversed them immediately, less than 24 [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  hours. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=174.0s)]
*  The NNSA maintains the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and combats nuclear terrorism [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=175.0s)]
*  among its other duties. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=180.16s)]
*  The Department of Energy says that, quote, fewer than 50 workers were ultimately terminated [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=181.94s)]
*  at the agency. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  Jeff Brumfield, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=188.6s)]
*  President Trump has celebrated Black History Month while his administration continues to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=191.6s)]
*  eliminate diversity and equity programs across the federal government. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=195.56s)]
*  And Piers Franco-Ordonez reports on the apparent contradictions. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=199.56s)]
*  Standing alongside golf icon Tiger Woods, President Trump announced a new, quote, garden [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=203.36s)]
*  of American heroes to be created to honor great Americans, including Black Americans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=208.96s)]
*  such as Rosa Parks, Aretha Franklin, Frederick Douglass, and Jackie Robinson. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=214.88s)]
*  We pay tribute to these heroes and to so many others, but not simply because they're Black [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=219.96s)]
*  heroes but also because they are truly American heroes who inspire all of us, very much so. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=225.36s)]
*  But the celebration comes amid his administration's war on diversity, equity, and inclusion programs [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=231.52s)]
*  and policies calling them discriminatory and contrary to the ideals they espouse. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  Trump has signed multiple executive orders to that end. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  Franco-Ordonez and Piers News, the White House. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=246.4s)]
*  The Israeli military has positively identified the bodies of two young boys kidnapped by [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  Hamas when the war started in October 2023. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=254.88s)]
*  But Israel says the body purported to be their mother is in fact unidentified and not her. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=257.64s)]
*  And Piers Hadil Al-Shalchi reports questions remain about how they were killed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=263.52s)]
*  The Palestinian militant group Hamas has maintained that Ariel and Kvir Bibas, who were four years [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=267.76s)]
*  old and nine months old at the time of their kidnapping, were killed in an Israeli airstrike [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=272.68s)]
*  on November 2023. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=277.2s)]
*  But while Israeli officials positively identified the young boys' bodies, they said the children [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=279.44s)]
*  were not killed in an airstrike and instead by their captors. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=284.08s)]
*  The Israeli military did not specify how they were killed. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=287.68s)]
*  The military also said the body Hamas claimed to be their mother, Shiri Bibas, was in fact [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=291.3s)]
*  of quote, an anonymous unidentified body. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=296.34s)]
*  Hamas is expected to release six live Israeli hostages on Saturday in exchange for more [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=299.88s)]
*  than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxN3di_78s0&t=304.62s)]
