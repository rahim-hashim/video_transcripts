# U.N. Secretary-General Calls For An End To The Fighting In Syria | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, December 6th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Labor Department says there was a big jump in the number of new jobs created during November. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=6.4s)]
*  Its latest snapshot says employers added 227,000 jobs last month. That's a huge difference from the October report when officials initially said only 12,000 jobs were created. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=10.88s)]
*  But that report was revised upward to show 32,000 jobs were actually created. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=22.72s)]
*  The weak reports were blamed on hurricanes and the strike at Boeing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=28.32s)]
*  President-elect Trump says he'll appoint venture capitalist David Sacks to be the White House's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=31.92s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen reports. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=40.16s)]
*  David Sacks is a venture capitalist associated with the so-called PayPal Mafia, a group of right-leaning technologists who helped found payment processor PayPal in the late 1990s. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=42.08s)]
*  In recent years, Sacks has helped fund raise for Trump and attacked what he sees as woke politics on his podcast All In. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=51.6s)]
*  Sacks is expected to oversee the dismantling of tech industry regulations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  He will also give crypto advocates a direct line into the White House and work alongside Elon Musk, a close friend of Sacks. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=63.36s)]
*  In his post on Truth Social announcing the role, Trump also said Sacks will safeguard free speech online and fight the censorship of big tech. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=70.4s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=78.72s)]
*  No serious damage is reported from yesterday's major earthquake off the Northern California coast. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=80.08s)]
*  The quake's magnitude was seven and it triggered a tsunami warning briefly for hundreds of miles off the California and Oregon coasts. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=85.52s)]
*  Alexandra Cochran is with the U.S. Geological Survey. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=93.2s)]
*  It was located offshore, which is good news in terms of the shaking intensities because the farther away you are from an earthquake, the less the shaking will be. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=96.8s)]
*  However, there was still strong shaking that occurred in the local nearby areas of the cities of Eureka and Rio del and Fortuna. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=106.0s)]
*  So we may see some damage from the shaking to those areas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=117.68s)]
*  There are no reports of serious injuries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=123.84s)]
*  Syrian rebels are advancing on the major city of Hama. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=126.16s)]
*  The rebels have already taken over Syria's second largest city Aleppo on their shock advance toward the capital, Damascus. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=129.52s)]
*  Clashes have been violent. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=137.12s)]
*  Linda Fasulo reports the U.N. Secretary General is calling for an end to the Syrian civil war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=138.72s)]
*  U.N. Secretary General Antony Guterres warned that tens of thousands of civilians are at risk in Syria and stressed there's an immediate need for humanitarian access. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=144.24s)]
*  He said that the current fighting is due to a chronic collective failure of diplomacy since the civil war began in 2011 and urged a return to the U.N. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=153.52s)]
*  facilitated political process to end the bloodshed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=162.24s)]
*  Guterres also called on all those with influence to do their part and said he spoke Thursday with Turkey's president who supports the rebels. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=165.44s)]
*  Russia and Iran are allied with Syria's president Bashar al-Assad. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=173.36s)]
*  For NPR News, Linda Fasulo in New York. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=177.44s)]
*  The color specialist company Pantone has named its color of the year. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=180.8s)]
*  It's called mocha mousse. That's a shade of brown. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  Pantone officials say they selected the color to represent what people are currently seeking, a feeling of harmony with the natural world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  Fashion and interior designers look for the yearly color choice to incorporate into future clothes and products. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=196.56s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman, NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_tLEAgw0pA&t=204.08s)]
