# Cuba No Longer Designated A 'State Sponsor Of Terrorism' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk)
*  Several of President-elect Trump's cabinet nominees will sit for confirmation hearings today in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=0.0s)]
*  Senate. And the Biden administration has announced it is removing Cuba from a list of state sponsors [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=4.72s)]
*  of terrorism. Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=9.92s)]
*  Several of President-elect Trump's cabinet nominees are having Senate confirmation hearings today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Susan Davis says some of the nominees are expected to receive quick confirmation votes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=19.76s)]
*  At the top of that list, I would probably put Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He's Trump's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=25.04s)]
*  nominee for Secretary of State. He's well known. He's vetted. He's well liked. He's poised to be [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=28.64s)]
*  confirmed on day one. You already have top Democrats like Dick Durbin, the number two [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=33.36s)]
*  Senate Democrat saying they'll support his nomination. Expect a big bipartisan vote for him. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=37.2s)]
*  I'd also put former Congressman Sean Duffy in that group. He's Trump's nominee for Transportation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=42.16s)]
*  Secretary. He also seems to be on a glide path to confirmation. NPR's Susan Davis reporting. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=46.8s)]
*  Other nominees include former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be U.S. Attorney General [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=52.08s)]
*  and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vogt to return to that position. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=57.36s)]
*  The Cuban government says it will gradually release hundreds of prisoners following talks [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=63.36s)]
*  with the Vatican and NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports the Biden administration seems to have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=68.0s)]
*  helped pave the way for the deal by announcing last-minute changes to U.S. sanctions policy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=72.88s)]
*  President Biden has informed Congress that he's taking Cuba off the list of state sponsors of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=78.24s)]
*  terrorism and rescinding Trump-era sanctions. Better late than never. That's Congressman Gregory [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=83.6s)]
*  Meeks, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I'm thankful to President Biden [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=88.96s)]
*  for doing it. Whether it's at the end or the beginning, the main thing is to have it done, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=94.08s)]
*  so it's a big deal. He's worried the incoming Trump administration could reverse this, but [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=98.72s)]
*  Biden administration officials say they've been talking to the transition team about the moves, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=103.36s)]
*  which they say were meant to help the Vatican negotiate the release of political prisoners [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=108.08s)]
*  in Cuba. Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, the State Department. Weather forecasters have again issued [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=112.8s)]
*  warnings for extremely dangerous winds in the Los Angeles area. Two major wildfires are still [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=119.2s)]
*  burning widely and they are only partially contained. Authorities say at least 25 people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  have now died because of the L.A. firestorm. More than 12,000 structures have been damaged or lost [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=130.48s)]
*  in the blazes. Many of the structures destroyed in the L.A. fires are homes. One local artist [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  is offering victims a free drawing of their house as a keepsake. For Member Station KCRW, Megan Jamerson [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=142.96s)]
*  has more. Asher Bingham was at a loss for words when she learned the fires destroyed the homes of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=150.32s)]
*  several friends, so the illustrator began creating line drawings of each house as a gift. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=155.68s)]
*  Word spread on social media and soon she had nearly 1,000 requests from strangers. She got to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=161.04s)]
*  work. I can just create them a memory and maybe it's something slightly nice in this really horrific [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  time. She now has the help of four other artists who are using photos and Google Earth to complete [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=171.68s)]
*  the drawings. Some families told Bingham they lost everything, so this drawing will be the only [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=176.88s)]
*  keepsake they have. For NPR News, I'm Megan Jamerson in Los Angeles. 16 years ago today, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=181.84s)]
*  a U.S. Airways passenger plane crash-landed belly-first on the water in New York's Hudson [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=187.92s)]
*  River. A flock of geese had flown into the plane, damaging its engines. Captain Sully [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=193.2s)]
*  Sullenberger guided the plane into the water, avoiding land and buildings and saved everyone [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  aboard. The shock landing was later dubbed the Miracle on the Hudson. I'm Corva Coleman, NPR News [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=204.48s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpEPVhoHk&t=212.23999999999998s)]
