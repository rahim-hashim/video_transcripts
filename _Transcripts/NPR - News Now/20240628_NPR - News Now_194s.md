# Debate Highlights Trump, Biden's Weaknesses | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0)
*  President Biden and former President Donald Trump faced off in the first debate of the election season last night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=0.0s)]
*  and nearly 200 people have been charged for their alleged roles in health care fraud schemes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=5.9s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=11.4s)]
*  Last night's debate between President Biden and former President Donald Trump featured them both trading personal insults. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=16.0s)]
*  They also sparred over issues such as abortion and the economy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=22.2s)]
*  Trump continued to lie about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=26.0s)]
*  but Biden is drawing a lot of criticism for a halting performance with his raspy voice and moments when he appeared to lose his train of thought. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=31.0s)]
*  NPR's Stephen Fowler reports from Atlanta. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=40.0s)]
*  For Biden, moments like this during the debate are likely to continue to stoke voter concerns about his age and fitness to serve. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=42.5s)]
*  Dealing with everything we have to do with, look, if we finally beat Medicare. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=48.5s)]
*  Voters may also take pause over Trump's continued insistence that he won the 2020 election and his refusal to promise to accept the 2024 results. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=57.8s)]
*  If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=65.5s)]
*  I would have much rather accepted these, but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=69.8s)]
*  For now, polls show a very tight race in this 2020 rematch. Stephen Fowler, NPR News, Atlanta. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=76.8s)]
*  Some Democrats are voicing concern about Biden's performance last night, but not all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=82.8s)]
*  California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom expressed support for Biden. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=87.8s)]
*  I know Joe Biden, I know what he's accomplished in the last three and a half years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  I know what he's capable of and I know his vision and I have no trepidation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=95.7s)]
*  Biden will campaign today in North Carolina. Trump will campaign today in Virginia. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=101.1s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court is poised to release fresh opinions later this morning. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=106.1s)]
*  One anticipated decision is whether a president can be criminally charged for actions taken while in office. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=110.39999999999999s)]
*  This stems from a case against Donald Trump. He is accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=117.0s)]
*  Trump says he is innocent and claims he cannot be prosecuted ever unless he is impeached and convicted by the Senate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=122.89999999999999s)]
*  He has been twice impeached, but never convicted. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  The Justice Department is bringing charges against nearly 200 people for their roles in health care fraud schemes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=134.4s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports the Justice Department alleges the schemes involve more than one and a half billion dollars in losses. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  Among the 193 defendants charged in the nationwide law enforcement effort were 76 medical professionals, including doctors and nurse practitioners. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=148.3s)]
*  Here's Attorney General Merrick Garland. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=157.4s)]
*  The Justice Department has been clear that we will bring to justice criminals who defraud Americans and steal from taxpayer funded programs. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=159.0s)]
*  One of the alleged fraudulent schemes involved over 900 million dollars related to unnecessary amniotic wound grafts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=167.6s)]
*  Another involved more than 146 million dollars in fraudulent addiction treatment services. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=174.4s)]
*  Garland says with its enforcement actions, the Justice Department aims to protect vulnerable patients and defend programs funded by taxpayer dollars. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=180.2s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EOur7w_J0&t=188.1s)]
