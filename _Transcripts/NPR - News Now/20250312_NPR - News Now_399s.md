# U.S. Department Of Education Cutting Nearly Half Its Staff | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA)
*  President Trump's 25 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports of steel and aluminum went into effect overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=0.0s)]
*  And pressure is now on the U.S. Senate to avert a partial federal government shutdown by the end of the week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=12.64s)]
*  President Trump's 25 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports of steel and aluminum went into effect overnight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=17.2s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reports hours before the tariffs took effect, Trump backed off steeper levies on Canada. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=22.88s)]
*  Foreign countries supply about a quarter of all the steel used in the U.S. and about half of all the aluminum. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Those imports are subject to a 25 percent tax, which could raise the price of everything from building materials to canned soda pop. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=34.8s)]
*  President Trump briefly threatened to double the tariff on imports from Canada, which is one of the United States' biggest suppliers of steel and aluminum. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=41.6s)]
*  But he stuck with the 25 percent levy after Ontario agreed to stop taxing electricity exports to the U.S. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Other countries have threatened to retaliate for the metal tariffs by slapping their own taxes on U.S. exports. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=55.36s)]
*  The trade war has been a drag on the stock market. Since the beginning of last week, the Dow Jones industrial average has tumbled more than 2400 points. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=60.56s)]
*  Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=67.6s)]
*  The Trump administration says it is cutting nearly half of the staff at the U.S. Department of Education. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=69.52s)]
*  Hundreds of staffers will be put on administrative leave starting March 21st. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=75.28s)]
*  But NPR's Janaki Mehta tells us some of the Education Department offices that are being affected were created by Congress. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=80.16s)]
*  The Institute of Education Sciences, or IES, does research on all kinds of topics related to American education. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  It has a bunch of sub-branches that were established in laws passed by Congress. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=94.64s)]
*  But I saw a termination email for an employee of one of those sub-branches that clearly states that their entire unit is being, quote, abolished. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=99.36s)]
*  Whether or not that's legal is not clear yet. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=109.12s)]
*  NPR's Janaki Mehta reporting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=112.08000000000001s)]

*  House Speaker Mike Johnson says the bill allows government functions to continue as Congress works on President Trump's broader agenda. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  It freezes funding. It's a responsible thing to do. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  And we're ensuring that troops continue to get their paychecks and TSA agents continue to do their work and be paid. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=137.6s)]
*  And essential workers on the border and elsewhere are doing their jobs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=144.8s)]
*  The House voted largely along party lines, with one Republican voting no and one Democrat joining the GOP to pass the bill. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=149.04s)]
*  Senate Republicans will need votes from Democrats to pass the legislation before government agencies run out of money Friday at midnight. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=157.28s)]

*  This follows high-level talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials yesterday. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  A Kremlin spokesman says Russia is waiting to learn the details of the talks and it can't comment yet. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=188.72s)]
*  But NPR's Michelle Kellerman reports the Trump administration has now decided to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=194.96s)]
*  After marathon talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Secretary Rubio appeared before the reporters traveling with him to announce some diplomatic progress. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=203.68s)]
*  What we alleviate with today is a commitment that the Ukrainians are ready to stop fighting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=212.8s)]
*  They're ready to stop the shooting so that they can get to the table and bring about peace for their country and for the world. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=217.6s)]
*  Asked if President Trump's relations with his Ukrainian counterpart have been repaired after an explosive White House meeting, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=222.88s)]
*  Rubio said, quote, this is not Mean Girls or some television show. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=229.68s)]
*  He said this is about stopping the fighting and starting negotiations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=234.48s)]

*  and commercial jetliners coming in for landings at Reagan National Airport to be insufficient. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsfMrKG7AA&t=275.11999999999995s)]
