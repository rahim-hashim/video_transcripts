# Trump Taps His Campaign Manager To Be His Chief Of Staff | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY)
*  Good morning. Today is Friday, November 8th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=2.52s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump has tapped his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=6.24s)]
*  to be his next White House chief of staff. NPR's Franco Ordoñez reports, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=9.84s)]
*  Wiles will be the first woman to serve in the role. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=14.16s)]
*  Trump touted Susie Wiles as helping him make history. In a statement, he said, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=16.8s)]
*  quote, Susie's a tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Trump went on to say the role was well-deserved and that she would make the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=26.36s)]
*  country proud. Wiles has worked for Trump's political operation off and on since 2016. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  She's widely credited with leading Trump's most disciplined campaign operation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=36.4s)]
*  Wiles did so quietly, remaining largely in the background and avoiding media and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=41.32s)]
*  public appearances. She declined to speak on election night, for example, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  when Trump called her to the stage during his victory speech in West Palm Beach. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=50.0s)]
*  Trump called her the ice maiden. Franco Ordoñez, NPR News, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=54.44s)]
*  West Palm Beach. Ex-E-Polls show more Latino voters backed Kamala Harris than [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=59.72s)]
*  those who chose Donald Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=64.48s)]
*  But data also show the Democrats have been winning fewer Latino votes in the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=66.52s)]
*  past several presidential elections. Political consultant Mike Madrid says [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=70.76s)]
*  that's because Latino voters are leading an emerging group of working class [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=75.2s)]
*  voters. He says many are leaving the Democratic Party as they become more [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=79.44s)]
*  pocketbook voters rather than aligning with racial or ethnic identity issues. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=83.52s)]
*  There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Latinos are becoming a more economic [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=88.56s)]
*  populist voter. There's very little evidence suggesting they're becoming more [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=91.84s)]
*  conservative. And that's an important distinction because when Donald Trump [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  talks about no taxes on tips, you know, restrictionist in trade, closing the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=99.48s)]
*  border, he's really speaking to the angst of a lot of these blue collar workers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=104.92s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's all things considered. Some congressional races remain too [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  close to call and that means it's still not yet clear which party will control [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=113.76s)]
*  the House of Representatives. Republicans have flipped control of the Senate and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  will hold at least 53 seats. The Senate races in Arizona and Nevada have not yet [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=122.48s)]
*  been called. The prime minister of the Netherlands says he is horrified by [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  violent clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and Israeli soccer [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=132.84s)]
*  supporters last night in Amsterdam. NPR's Rob Schmitz reports that Dutch [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=137.36s)]
*  police say this led to the arrest of 62 people. Amsterdam police say they've [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=142.04s)]
*  launched an investigation into multiple violent incidents involving fans of an [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=146.28s)]
*  Israeli soccer team who clashed with pro-Palestinian protesters following a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=150.92s)]
*  match between a Tel Aviv club and a local Amsterdam team. Police say five [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=155.16s)]
*  people have been hospitalized and that they are aware of reports involving a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=160.2s)]
*  hostage situation and possible missing persons but have not been able to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=163.96s)]
*  confirm them. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof called the attacks on Israeli [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=168.0s)]
*  fans anti-semitic and completely unacceptable. He promised Israel's prime [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=171.92s)]
*  minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the perpetrators would be identified and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=176.6s)]
*  prosecuted. This is NPR. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZakLpMmh1qY&t=179.95999999999998s)]
