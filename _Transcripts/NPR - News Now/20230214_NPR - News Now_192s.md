*  There's been another mass shooting in the U.S., this time at Michigan State University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And Syria is looking for more aid from Turkey in the aftermath of last week's earthquake [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=5.12s)]
*  and aftershocks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=9.76s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=10.76s)]
*  A mass shooting at Michigan State University in East Lansing last night has killed three [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=15.88s)]
*  people and left five others injured. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=20.28s)]
*  From member station WDET, Alex McClennan reports the wounded are critically injured. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=22.8s)]
*  MSU campus police began receiving reports of a mass shooting a little after 8.15 p.m. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=28.36s)]
*  on Monday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=34.32s)]
*  Following a manhunt, the suspect, a 43-year-old male, died from an apparent self-inflicted [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=35.32s)]

*  We're devastated at the loss of life, and we want to wrap our warm arms around every [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=50.84s)]
*  family that is touched by this tragedy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=57.28s)]
*  Law enforcement have yet to name the suspect and have not identified a motive. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=60.56s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Alex McClennan in Detroit. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=65.44s)]
*  In southern Turkey, at least three more people have been pulled alive from the rubble more [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=68.08s)]
*  than a week after a deadly earthquake and aftershocks. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=72.44s)]
*  But more than 35,000 people have been killed in Turkey and Syria. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=76.04s)]
*  NPR's Peter Kenyon reports Syria has agreed to open more border crossings to receive aid [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=79.76s)]

*  temperatures with no water. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=95.28s)]
*  The state news agency reports two brothers, aged 21 and 17, were rescued from a collapsed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=97.44s)]
*  apartment block in Karamanmaras province. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=102.32s)]
*  Separately, Syria agreed to open two additional border crossings to receive aid and supplies [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  from Turkey. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=109.72s)]
*  But Turkey's foreign minister says it's quote, out of the question, to deliver aid to areas [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  controlled by the PKK and YPG militant groups. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=115.06s)]
*  Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Istanbul. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=119.3s)]
*  The Senate will get a closed-door classified briefing today about the three unidentified [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=121.26s)]
*  objects shot down by U.S. forces over the U.S. and Canada. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=125.54s)]
*  Pentagon officials will likely also discuss information gleaned from a Chinese spy balloon [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=129.66s)]
*  shot down earlier this month off the coast of South Carolina. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=134.5s)]
*  The incidents have caused deep tension between the U.S. and China. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=138.26s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a trip to Beijing over the matter. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=142.14s)]
*  He says he looks forward to making that visit when the time is right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=146.5s)]
*  In the context of the surveillance balloon, those weren't the right conditions to go forward [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=150.26s)]
*  with the trip. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  So when we get those conditions, when China demonstrates that it wants to engage in a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=157.98s)]
*  responsible manner, then I hope we'll have an opportunity to pursue it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  He spoke to NPR's morning edition. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  Weather forecasters say that a winter storm is hitting the central plains and moving [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=171.7s)]
*  east. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=176.22s)]
*  There are blizzard warnings now posted in North and South Dakota and in Minnesota. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=177.22s)]
*  A second winter storm is forming in the southwest. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=182.14s)]
*  It will move into the plains by tomorrow. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=185.42s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZOSN0hXDtQ&t=188.78s)]
