# Musk Calls Republicans' 'Big Beautiful Bill' An 'Abomination' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q)
*  Billionaire Elon Musk is blasting Republicans' signature spending bill, calling it a quote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=0.0s)]
*  disgusting abomination. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=5.2s)]
*  And the White House is ending a requirement that hospitals offer abortions to women whose [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=7.34s)]
*  pregnancies are a threat to their lives. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=11.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=14.24s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=15.24s)]
*  The cost of imported steel and aluminum is going up. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=19.12s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reports President Trump has ordered a doubling of the tariff on the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=22.04s)]
*  imported metals starting today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=26.32s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order boosting the tax on imported steel and aluminum [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=28.86s)]
*  from 25 to 50 percent, making good on a pledge he issued last week while visiting a steel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=32.38s)]
*  mill outside Pittsburgh. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=38.06s)]
*  Trump says the higher tariffs will help to protect the domestic steel and aluminum industries. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  History shows it will also raise prices for the much more numerous businesses that use [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=44.9s)]
*  those metals. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=49.04s)]
*  The 50 percent import taxes could have far-reaching effects on the cost of everything from automobiles [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  to beer cans. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=55.34s)]
*  The tariffs are authorized under a 1962 law designed to protect national security. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=56.92s)]
*  That's different from the 1977 law Trump has relied on for many of his other tariffs, which [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=61.92s)]
*  is at the center of an ongoing court battle. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=66.52s)]
*  Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=69.28s)]
*  Billionaire Elon Musk is blasting President Trump's signature spending bill as a quote [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=71.28s)]
*  disgusting abomination. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  The remarks follow Musk's departure as head of the White House cost-cutting initiative. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=77.86s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen has more. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=82.36s)]
*  In a post on X, Musk has escalated his attacks on President Trump's big, beautiful bill, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=84.28s)]
*  which is awaiting a vote in the Senate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=88.74s)]
*  Musk writes the legislation is a quote massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=90.76s)]
*  bill, saying the House lawmakers who passed it should be ashamed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  The bill would cut taxes, boost military and border security spending, and slashes funding [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=98.68s)]
*  to Medicaid and clean energy programs. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add more than $2 trillion to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=106.16s)]
*  the deficit. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=110.04s)]
*  In a White House briefing, Press Secretary Carolyn Levitt said Trump knows where Musk [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=111.2s)]
*  stood on the bill, and that does not change Trump's opinion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=114.44s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=118.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has revoked a Biden-era requirement that hospitals give emergency [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=120.0s)]
*  abortions to women in danger of their lives. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  That also included in states where abortion is outlawed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=128.24s)]
*  But there's a federal law still on the books requiring hospitals to provide emergency reproductive [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  care. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=137.4s)]
*  So it's not clear yet if the Trump administration is instructing hospitals to turn away women [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=138.46s)]
*  in medical emergencies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=144.3s)]
*  The U.S. Agriculture Department says it is suspending a demand for personal data about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  people who get federal food assistance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=150.62s)]
*  NPR's Jude Jaffe Block reports there's a federal lawsuit challenging the collection of the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=153.3s)]
*  data. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=158.5s)]
*  Last month, the USDA told states they'd be required to turn over names, birth dates, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=159.5s)]
*  numbers and addresses of everyone who applied for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=164.62s)]
*  Program, known as SNAP, over the last five years. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=168.54s)]
*  The guidance cited a presidential executive order which calls for data sharing to find [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=172.12s)]
*  fraud, waste and abuse, and came as the Department of Government Efficiency Effort, or DOGE, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=176.3s)]
*  has been amassing data for purposes that include immigration enforcement. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=181.84s)]
*  A coalition sued USDA and federal court, saying the SNAP data demand did not comply with federal [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=186.1s)]
*  privacy laws. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=191.82s)]
*  In a recent court filing, a USDA official said the agency has not yet collected SNAP [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=193.36s)]
*  data and will not until all necessary legal requirements are met. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  Jude Jaffe Block, NPR News. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=203.12s)]
*  The Trump administration wants to limit how long people can get federal rental aid. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports the housing agency is writing a rule that would also allow [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  work requirements. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  The rule could be proposed by this fall, according to an internal document seen by NPR. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=217.08s)]
*  It would expand policies that, right now, only a few local housing authorities have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=222.36s)]
*  the power to enact. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=226.96s)]
*  It's part of a broader push to promote self-sufficiency. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Though critics say there's little evidence, these policies do that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  Tacoma Housing Authority in Washington state recently ended its time limits. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=235.56s)]
*  Executive Director April Black says tenants' wages could not keep up with skyrocketing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=240.52s)]
*  rents. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  There was no way that we were going to exit people from a program knowing that they would [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  become homeless. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=249.16000000000003s)]
*  Limiting time limits and work requirements without going through Congress could also [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=251.04s)]
*  face a legal challenge. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=255.44s)]
*  Jennifer Ludden, NPR News. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=257.08s)]
*  There's a vigil planned tonight in Boulder, Colorado, for the 12 victims injured in this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=259.36s)]

*  They were holding a peaceful march for hostages still held in Gaza. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=265.8s)]
*  The suspect is jailed and facing several counts of attempted first-degree murder. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=269.8s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the suspect's family has also been detained [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=274.4s)]
*  by federal immigration agents. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=279.12s)]
*  But we're also investigating to what extent his family knew about this horrific attack, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=281.32s)]
*  if they had any knowledge of it or if they provided support to it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=285.88s)]
*  Noem says the suspect is in the U.S. illegally. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  He is an Egyptian national whose tourist visa has expired. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=293.28000000000003s)]

*  status in this country unclear. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. private group distributing food in Gaza is suspending operation today. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=306.36s)]
*  This comes after three deadly shootings in the past three days near the group's distribution [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=311.15999999999997s)]

*  Dozens of Palestinians have been killed there since the group began work in Gaza more than [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=316.8s)]

*  The group says it was not prepared to deal with the large crowds at one site. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=332.78s)]
*  15,000 people arrived in one hour. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zsRFwo945Q&t=336.41999999999996s)]
