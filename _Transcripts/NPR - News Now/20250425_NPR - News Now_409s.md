# Trump Makes It Easier To Mine The Ocean Floor | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI)
*  President Trump wants to make it easier to mine the ocean floor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=0.0s)]
*  And Kentucky is the latest state after Arkansas, North Carolina, and Washington state in recent weeks [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=3.5s)]
*  to be denied FEMA funding for disaster recovery. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=9.1s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  President Trump has signed an executive order. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=16.8s)]
*  As NPR's Julia Simon reports, this is aimed at making it easier for mining companies to dig for minerals on the ocean floor. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=19.7s)]
*  Deep on the ocean floor are potato-sized nodules that contain metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=28.3s)]
*  These metals can be used in technologies like batteries. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=35.0s)]
*  The executive order instructs federal departments to expedite the process for reviewing and issuing permits for mining on the seafloor. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=38.0s)]
*  Scientists and environmental groups are already condemning the order, arguing that opening the deep seabed for mining could damage important marine ecosystems. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=45.3s)]
*  Underwater mining involves giant machines and creates plumes of sediment that could suffocate marine life. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=54.5s)]
*  That can have serious impacts on and disrupt the fishing industry. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=60.6s)]
*  Julia Simon, NPR News. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=64.6s)]
*  White House envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow today for another round of talks focused on Ukraine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=66.8s)]
*  He's expected to present a U.S.-backed peace plan. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=71.5s)]
*  President Trump is insisting the U.S. is closing in on a deal to end the war. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=74.6s)]
*  NPR's Charles Maines has more from Moscow. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=78.8s)]
*  This is Witkoff's fourth visit to Russia since the Trump administration began negotiations aimed at ending the war. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  And while details of the U.S. peace plan are not publicly known, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  administration officials indicate it involves acknowledging Russia's rightful hold over territories seized from Ukraine by force. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=90.7s)]
*  That includes the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed by Russia back in 2014. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=97.5s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly rejected the idea, angering President Trump in the process. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=102.5s)]
*  Yet Trump has also expressed frustration with Russia over its continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=108.8s)]
*  including strikes on the capital Kiev Thursday that left at least a dozen people dead and scores more injured. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=114.1s)]
*  Charles Maines, NPR News, Moscow. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=119.8s)]
*  This morning, Time magazine has published an interview with President Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=122.1s)]
*  In it, Trump says that Crimea will stay with Russia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  President Trump is going to Rome today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=129.7s)]
*  He and First Lady Melania Trump will attend Pope Francis' funeral tomorrow. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=131.9s)]
*  Trump's focus is to attend the ceremony at the Vatican, but other world leaders will also be there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=136.0s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaram reports Trump may have side conversations with them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=141.2s)]
*  Trump is only expected to be in Italy for a short time Saturday, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=145.5s)]
*  attending Pope Francis' funeral in the morning before heading back to the U.S. the same day. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=148.7s)]
*  But it's possible he takes part in some sideline meetings, including with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=153.5s)]
*  It would be the first time the two meet since the blowout meeting in the Oval Office in February. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=159.4s)]
*  A meeting with European Union President Ursula von der Leyen could also be possible amid ongoing negotiations over tariffs. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=164.6s)]
*  Trump's visit to Rome and the Vatican marks his first foreign trip of this term. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=171.4s)]
*  His next will likely be a visit to the Middle East next month. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=175.5s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=178.9s)]
*  The Trump administration is restoring funding to a landmark study of women's health. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=180.6s)]
*  NBS Rob Stein has the story. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  The Department of Health and Human Services says the administration is reversing a decision to slash funding [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  for the Women's Health Initiative, which has been following tens of thousands of women for decades. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=193.7s)]
*  An HHS spokesman says the decision was made because the National Institutes of Health, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  which funds the study, was able to exceed savings by cutting other research contracts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  The decision to cut the project had shocked medical researchers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=210.1s)]
*  because the study has been responsible for a series of landmark discoveries about women's health. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=213.79999999999998s)]

*  Kentucky is still waiting to hear from Washington about whether or not federal aid will be provided for victims of flooding [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=243.7s)]

*  There's no magic bullet to get around it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=255.8s)]
*  If it's denied, then the president is saying that that money will not be available to help our families rebuild. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=258.1s)]
*  He says he'll appeal the denials. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h22ttnhQ6LI&t=265.90000000000003s)]
