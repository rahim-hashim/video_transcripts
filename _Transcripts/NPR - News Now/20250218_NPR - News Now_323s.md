*  individual assistance that will provide some dollars for this emergency phase, for cleaning up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELhvZLplaoI&t=156.32s)]
*  But then that's up to $42,000 to help people get back on their feet. And we're going to need that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELhvZLplaoI&t=162.0s)]
