*  consistent improvement in energy efficiency over time. Dulaski says if the proposals are finalized, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bwvj4V7_a4&t=448.4s)]
*  they likely will be challenged in court. Jeff Brady, NPR News. This is NPR. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bwvj4V7_a4&t=453.84s)]
