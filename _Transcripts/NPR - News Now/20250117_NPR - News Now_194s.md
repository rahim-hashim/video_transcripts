**NPR - News Now:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw)
*  Israel's security cabinet is meeting now to vote on a proposed ceasefire deal with Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Biden is commuting the sentences of nearly 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=5.32s)]
*  drug offenses. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=10.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=11.56s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=12.56s)]
*  Some members of the ruling Israeli coalition government are reviewing the proposed ceasefire [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=16.32s)]
*  deal with Hamas for Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=20.28s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf says the ceasefire deal has not yet been approved. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  It's currently being voted on by the security cabinet. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=26.28s)]
*  It's an inner circle of the more senior members of the Israeli government. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=29.12s)]
*  Then it still needs to get approved by the larger government, and it also might be challenged [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=33.52s)]
*  in the Supreme Court. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=37.36s)]
*  So there are a few more steps. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=38.44s)]
*  You know, it's unclear when the larger government vote will happen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=39.84s)]
*  So all of that said, it could be several days before we see a ceasefire actually go into [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=43.04s)]
*  effect. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=47.32s)]
*  It could be as early as Sunday, but we still don't know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=48.32s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reporting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=50.16s)]
*  There have been disagreements within the Israeli security cabinet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=52.16s)]
*  Two far right members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government are strongly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=55.2s)]
*  opposed to the deal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=60.1s)]
*  They've both threatened to leave the government. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  That in turn could collapse Netanyahu's ruling coalition. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=64.12s)]
*  President Biden is commuting the sentences of nearly 2,500 people a few days before his [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=68.56s)]
*  term in office ends. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=73.48s)]

*  drug offenses. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=79.78s)]
*  President Biden says he has now issued more individual pardons and commutations than any [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=81.24s)]
*  president in U.S. history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=85.78s)]
*  The latest commutations are for people serving disproportionately long sentences compared [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=87.74s)]
*  to the sentences they would receive today under current law. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  Some were sentenced under the now discredited distinction between crack and powdered cocaine, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=95.94s)]
*  disparities Congress tried to address when it passed the Fair Sentencing Act. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  President Biden says he may issue additional pardons and commutations before he leaves [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=105.41999999999999s)]
*  office on Monday. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=109.64s)]

*  Noem has strongly supported Trump's border policies and positions on immigration. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=122.0s)]
*  As governor, she sent South Dakota National Guard troops to the southern U.S. border to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=126.64s)]

*  Ohio Congressman Mike Turner. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=136.84s)]
*  Turner says the speaker told him there were concerns from quote Mar-a-Lago indicating [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  President-elect Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=144.12s)]
*  NPR Susan Davis says Turner is a more establishment Republican who doesn't fully share Trump's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=145.84s)]
*  America First ideology. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQpRC5Z4tw&t=151.28s)]
