# U.S., U.K. Carry Out Airstrikes In Yemen Overnight | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4)
*  The U.S. and U.K. carried out airstrikes in Yemen overnight, and the Gaza Health Ministry [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=0.0s)]
*  says more than 23-thousand people have been killed by Israeli forces in the past three [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=4.98s)]
*  months. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=10.48s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=11.48s)]
*  The U.S. and U.K. launched strikes on several Houthi military targets in Yemen overnight, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  including radar sites, drone bases and storage facilities and launchers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=21.76s)]
*  This comes after more than two months of Houthi attacks on international cargo ships and U.S. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=26.16s)]
*  warships in the Red Sea. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=30.6s)]
*  And Piers, Tom Bowman has more. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=32.32s)]
*  It's uncertain what more capabilities the Houthis have to attack shipping. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=34.88s)]
*  Some of the shipping companies like Maersk from Denmark have stopped sending ships into [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  the Red Sea because of the threat. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  So first of all, we don't know if the Houthis will continue any attacks if they can. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  And then secondly, what's the reaction of the shipping companies? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=51.8s)]
*  Will they pause, you know, rather than go into the Red Sea, continue going around Africa [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=56.36s)]
*  on their way to Europe, or will they feel comfortable now actually going into the Red [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=61.68s)]
*  Sea? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=65.56s)]
*  And Piers, Tom Bowman reporting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=66.56s)]
*  After three months of war, Gaza's Ministry of Health says more than 23-thousand people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=68.8s)]
*  have been killed by Israeli forces. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=73.72s)]
*  And Piers Kerry Kahn reports that's 1% of Gaza's population. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=76.12s)]
*  With a population of around 2.2 million, the new death toll means that one out of every [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=80.36s)]
*  100 people in Gaza have died in the war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=85.88s)]
*  Israel has been bombarding Gaza by land, sea, and air since Hamas militants stormed the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=89.2s)]
*  border on October 7th, killing around 1,200 people and kidnapping more than 200. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=93.4s)]
*  Israeli officials say more than 100 remain captive inside Gaza and they insist they are [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=99.76s)]
*  not targeting civilians, only Hamas fighters. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=104.64s)]
*  More than 85% of the population of Gaza has been displaced. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=108.32s)]
*  Israel issued new evacuation orders this week, sending even more residents into the already [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=113.0s)]
*  overcrowded south where UN officials say people are living in inhumane conditions with no [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  sanitation and scarce food and water. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  Kerry Kahn, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  The White House is reviewing protocols for delegating authority in the president's cabinet [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=129.28s)]
*  After being surprised by the hospitalization of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, NPR's Franco [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=135.20000000000002s)]

*  The White House told cabinet secretaries in a memo that he was reviewing the rules for [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  how cabinet members delegate their authority when they're hospitalized under anesthesia [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  or otherwise unable to be reached. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=150.88s)]
*  The White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters that they will not turn to GPS technology. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  We're not going to track the GPS coordinates on somebody's mobile phone in the administration [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=158.8s)]
*  and we're not going to plant a microchip in their neck like they're a poodle. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=164.12s)]
*  Kirby says officials know this is a problem and that the White House needs to know if [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=166.76s)]
*  a cabinet official is hospitalized, but he assured reporters that they will learn from [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niL-MLnsEg4&t=171.16s)]
