# House Votes Fail To Impeach Mayorkas, Advance Aid For Israel | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90)
*  President Biden easily won Nevada's Democratic primary election yesterday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=0.0s)]
*  and a jury has found a Michigan woman guilty of involuntary manslaughter [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=4.4s)]
*  in connection to her son's deadly rampage at a high school in 2021. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=8.48s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley did not win yesterday's Republican presidential [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=17.36s)]
*  primary in Nevada. A majority of GOP voters chose the option, none of these candidates on the ballot. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=21.6s)]
*  Haley came in second. Donald Trump was not on the ballot. He's expected to win the Nevada GOP caucuses [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  tomorrow, where delegates are awarded. In the Nevada Democratic contest, President Biden won [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=33.44s)]
*  easily. NPR's Franco Artonias reports from Las Vegas. The outcome was expected, but the stakes [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=38.8s)]
*  are high considering the stakes' critical role in the general election. Nevada is the first of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=44.56s)]
*  big swing states to vote in a primary. In 2020, Biden won Nevada by just under 3 percent of the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  vote, which only increases interest. Both Biden and his expected Republican competitor, former [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=55.84s)]
*  President Donald Trump, have been working to test out messaging and get any information they can to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  prepare for November. And with his eye on the rematch, Biden held a rally in Las Vegas over the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=67.36s)]
*  weekend, warning that it could be a nightmare if Trump were re-elected. Franco Artonias, NPR News, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Las Vegas. The House has failed to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=80.16s)]
*  four Republicans joined all the Democrats in blocking the measure. One of them was Colorado [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=85.52s)]
*  Republican Ken Buck. Impeachment is supposed to be a very, very last resort type of remedy, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=89.92s)]
*  not something that is used every Congress. Republicans allege Mayorkas has violated federal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=96.32s)]
*  law and allowed millions of migrants to cross the border illegally. He denies that. House GOP leaders [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  say they'll bring the resolution up again. Democrats say this is a political ploy. Separately, the House [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=106.64s)]
*  also failed to pass a standalone aid bill for Israel. Some top Republican senators are now [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=113.04s)]
*  calling for another aid bill to help Israel and Ukraine. They're dropping their demand that foreign [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  aid be tied to a border security measure. The Senate will hold a procedural vote on a border [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=124.56s)]
*  measure today, but it's lost GOP support. A jury in Michigan has found Jennifer Crumbly guilty of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=129.36s)]
*  four counts of involuntary manslaughter. She's the mother of a teen who killed four students in a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=135.44s)]
*  mass shooting in 2021. NPR's Martin Costey reports some hope this will raise the bar for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=140.48s)]
*  gun responsibility for parents. Jennifer Crumbly and her husband James, who still faces trial, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=146.56s)]
*  were accused of not only providing their 15-year-old son with a handgun, but also ignoring [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  clear signs he was contemplating violence. Adam Skaggs is vice president of the Giffords Law Center, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=156.64s)]
*  a gun safety organization. If it is sometimes hard to draw the line exactly where negligence [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=162.56s)]
*  or carelessness crosses into culpability, this case is squarely on the other side of that line. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=168.96s)]
*  Skaggs says the case may inspire other prosecutors to try to deter parental irresponsibility with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  guns. Several states have passed new laws requiring that guns be secured from children, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  including Michigan, whose safe storage law takes effect next week. Martin Costey reporting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=186.56s)]
*  Pop star Taylor Swift is threatening legal action against a college student who tracks the private [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=192.24s)]
*  jet flights of celebrities, but he uses public data. The student has also angered billionaire [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=197.04s)]
*  Elon Musk for the very same reason. A swath of salt marsh on the California coast was eroding for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=203.12s)]
*  decades until a bunch of sea otters moved back into the neighborhood. Ari Daniel has more on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=209.84s)]
*  how their return helped preserve the marsh. Elkhorn Slough, the country's second largest [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=215.44s)]
*  estuary, was in bad shape. Chunks of marsh were calving off into the water, due in part to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  shore crabs burrowing into the dirt and eating the roots, holding it all together. But since the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=226.96s)]
*  80s, sea otters have gradually recolonized the area. Researchers compared parts of the marsh [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  where otters could feed on the crabs to sections where they kept them out. The result was that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=238.08s)]
*  wherever sea otters could gorge on crabs, the marsh stabilized. The conservation of a top predator [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=242.88s)]
*  can really enhance the health and the resilience of a system that's otherwise under a portfolio [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  of stress. Christine Angelini is a coastal ecologist at the University of Florida. She [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=254.4s)]
*  says it's important to factor in the role predators play in preserving their ecosystems. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=259.52s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel. I'm Cora VaColeman, NPR News. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWwjchbWC90&t=264.64s)]
