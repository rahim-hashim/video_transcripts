# Florida Residents Urged To Evacuate Ahead Of Milton's Landfall | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo)
*  Hurricane Milton was downgraded to a powerful Category 4 storm overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=0.0s)]
*  And the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments today over whether the government should be able to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=4.96s)]
*  regulate so-called ghost guns. Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  top stories. Hurricane Milton was downgraded from a Category 5 to a Category 4 storm overnight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Its top sustained winds are at 145 miles per hour. Milton will make landfall this week on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=21.2s)]
*  Florida's Gulf Coast. This could be the first time Tampa has had a direct hurricane hit since 1921. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=26.96s)]
*  Officials are telling people to get out now or risk death. Many people in the southeast are still [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=33.6s)]
*  recovering from Hurricane Helene, and they're feeling the psychological toll of these intense [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=39.68s)]
*  weather patterns. Blue Ridge Public Radio's Laura Hackett has more. When Hurricane Helene knocked [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  out power, water, cell service, and internet all over western North Carolina, many chose to evacuate. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=50.16s)]
*  Chad and Kim Haight fled to the Gulf Coast of Florida to be with their parents and recover from [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=56.8s)]
*  what was a traumatic experience. Only a few days later, they found out another storm was heading [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  their way, forcing them to patch together a whole new round of safety and evacuation plans. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=66.72s)]
*  Just the mental weight of having a storm coming and knowing it could be very bad after just going [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=72.24s)]
*  through something almost exactly the same. For NPR News, I'm Laura Hackett in Asheville, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=81.12s)]
*  North Carolina. Former President Donald Trump spoke over the weekend about hurricane recovery [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=86.48s)]
*  efforts in North Carolina. In an interview aired last night by Fox News, Trump claimed GOP voters [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=91.28s)]
*  were more affected in that state. Republican areas got hit very hard. You know that. It got hit very, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=97.12s)]
*  very hard. I believe, and many people are dead, you know, many people are dead. They don't even [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  know what it's going to be in terms of the number. You know, they have hundreds are missing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=109.2s)]
*  And I can't really speak to it. I can only say that I believe they're going to go out and vote [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=114.16s)]
*  if they have to crawl to a voting booth. And that's what's happening. The death toll from Hurricane [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=118.08s)]
*  Helene stands now at 230 people. It is unclear how many people are still missing. The US Supreme Court [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  hears arguments today in a case that pits the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=129.68s)]
*  Explosives against the makers of so-called ghost guns. These are build-it-yourself gun kits. They [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=134.4s)]
*  produce an untraceable weapon with no serial number and no background check for the buyer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=140.56s)]
*  NPR's Nina Totenberg has more. The kit producers contend that a bunch of parts is not a gun, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  but law enforcement groups disagree, pointing to the proliferation of ghost guns at crime scenes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=152.24s)]
*  in recent years. Police chiefs from 70 major cities have filed briefs in today's case, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=157.84s)]
*  along with prosecutors and national security officers and leading intelligence officials [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=163.84s)]
*  from Republican and Democratic administrations. They say that bad actors are drawn to ghost guns [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  for the same reasons the government wants to regulate them. They're untraceable and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=174.56s)]
*  readily available to those who would not pass the background checks required when buying a gun from [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=179.04s)]
*  a licensed dealer. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. You're listening to NPR News from [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=184.8s)]
*  Washington. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foC_sooimCo&t=191.36s)]
