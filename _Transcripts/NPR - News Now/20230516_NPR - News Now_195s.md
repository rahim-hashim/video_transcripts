# Ukraine Downs 'Unstoppable' Russian Missiles Overnight | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68)
*  The White House will host a second round of talks this afternoon to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=0.0s)]
*  And Ukraine says it shot down six missiles overnight that Russian President Vladimir Putin previously called unstoppable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=5.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=12.0s)]
*  President Biden will be meeting with congressional leaders this afternoon at the White House. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=17.0s)]
*  They'll talk about raising the debt ceiling. NPR's Asma Khalid reports this will be the second such meeting at the White House in a week [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=22.0s)]
*  aimed at reaching an agreement to avoid a default. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=29.0s)]
*  The White House and Republicans have been at a standoff over raising the debt ceiling. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=32.0s)]
*  Republicans have been demanding major spending cuts. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=37.0s)]
*  The White House says the obligations to pay down existing debt is a separate issue from the budget. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=40.0s)]
*  A source familiar with the discussions says potential areas of common ground could include things like permitting reform. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=46.0s)]
*  But the two sides remain far apart on other issues such as new work requirements for Medicaid and food assistance. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=53.0s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued a letter yesterday reiterating the urgent need for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=60.0s)]
*  Or the government could default on its debt as early as June 1st. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=67.0s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=72.0s)]
*  There's a primary election today in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=74.0s)]
*  Democrats have control of the state House by one vote, and they'll learn today if they will keep it after the results come in from a special House election. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=77.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, voters in Philadelphia are choosing candidates for their mayoral primary election. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=87.0s)]
*  From member station WHYY, Cory Sharber has more on the neck-and-neck race. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=92.0s)]
*  Registered Democrats in Philly outnumber Republicans 7-1, so today's Democratic primary winner is expected to earn the city's top spot. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=98.0s)]
*  The candidates include former city council members, a former city controller, a state representative, and a grocery store magnate. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=106.0s)]
*  Philadelphia's next mayor could also be the first woman to hold the position, with the three female candidates leading in the latest polls. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=113.0s)]
*  Just 27 percent of registered voters cast a ballot last time there was a competitive mayoral primary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=120.0s)]
*  If that happens, the winner could be decided by as few as 2,000 votes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=126.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Cory Sharber in Philadelphia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=131.0s)]
*  Ukraine says it shot down six of Russia's most advanced missiles during overnight bombing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=134.0s)]
*  The attack was described as exceptional in its density. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=140.0s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin had called the Kinzhal missiles unstoppable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=144.0s)]
*  Ukraine's military says that its air force has achieved an unbelievable success. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=149.0s)]
*  The BBC's Hugo Pacheca reports the timing of the attack is significant. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=154.0s)]
*  These latest attacks happened just hours after President Zelensky finished this European tour. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=159.0s)]
*  He received the promise that billions of dollars of military aid will be provided to Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=165.0s)]
*  And this happens as Ukraine says it's finishing plans for a much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=172.0s)]
*  And many believe that these attacks are likely to not only continue, but perhaps intensify, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=179.0s)]
*  because this could be the way Russia is planning to respond. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=186.0s)]
*  The BBC's Hugo Pacheca reporting. It's NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL6yAXrH_68&t=189.0s)]
