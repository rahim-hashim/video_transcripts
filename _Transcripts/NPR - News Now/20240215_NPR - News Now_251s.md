# Investigation Continues Into Deadly Kansas City Shooting | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE)
*  The investigation continues into yesterday's deadly mass shooting at a Kansas City Super Bowl victory rally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=0.0s)]
*  And Israeli troops have entered one of the last major hospitals still functioning in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=6.4s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=11.0s)]
*  Kansas City authorities say one woman was killed and 21 other people were shot during a celebration yesterday [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=15.1s)]
*  for the Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs. At least nine children were shot. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=21.2s)]
*  Police have arrested three suspects in the mass shooting. From member station KCUR, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=25.8s)]
*  Frank Morris says officials haven't yet said what might have led to the gunfire. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  Police haven't released a motive or the names of the suspects. Police arrested three people. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=34.2s)]
*  At least one of them was carrying a weapon. There was a huge police presence at the event. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=39.1s)]
*  And some of the crowd reportedly helped bring down one of the suspects. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=43.0s)]
*  Frank Morris reporting. Israeli troops have entered one of the last major hospitals still functioning in Gaza, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=46.3s)]
*  but they're allowing patients and the staff to remain. As NPR's Greg Myhre reports, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=53.2s)]
*  Israel alleges Hamas was holding hostages at the hospital. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=57.9s)]
*  Israeli forces entered the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza and ordered doctors, nurses, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=61.7s)]
*  and other staff to come down from the upper floors to the lower floors. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=67.1s)]
*  This is according to a nurse in contact with NPR. The Israeli military said it had quote, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=71.3s)]
*  credible intelligence that Hamas was holding Israeli hostages at the complex in the city of Hanunis. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=77.39999999999999s)]
*  Israel also said the bodies of dead hostages may be at the hospital. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=84.0s)]
*  This comes a day after Israel ordered thousands of civilians taking shelter on the hospital grounds to leave. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=88.6s)]
*  Israel's offensive has led to the shutdown of virtually every major medical facility in Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=95.3s)]
*  Greg Myhre, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=101.3s)]
*  A Georgia judge will consider today whether to disqualify the Fulton County District Attorney [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=104.2s)]
*  from prosecuting the state election interference case against former President Donald Trump and 14 others. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=109.9s)]
*  From member station WABE in Atlanta, Sam Greenglass reports, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=116.3s)]
*  several defendants are accusing D.A. Fani Willis of a conflict of interest [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=120.5s)]
*  given her relationship with a special prosecutor whom she hired for the case. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  More than half of the defendants, including Trump, say Willis' relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade tainted the case against them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=129.4s)]
*  They argue the two prosecutors are enriching themselves the longer the case drags on, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=136.9s)]
*  while the prosecutors insist they have no financial interest in the outcome. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  Willis and Wade could be forced to testify in open court, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=145.4s)]
*  and Judge Scott McAfee has said it's possible the allegations could result in disqualification. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=148.8s)]
*  If that happens, a state council has to appoint a special prosecutor, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=154.4s)]
*  but that may not happen quickly, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=159.0s)]
*  so the outcome could determine whether those 15 people accused of meddling with the 2020 result [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=160.8s)]
*  will face trial before the next election in November. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=166.4s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sam Greenglass in Atlanta. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=169.3s)]
*  Donald Trump is scheduled to appear in a New York City criminal courtroom today. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=171.9s)]
*  He will learn whether his trial on dozens of counts will start on March 25th. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=176.5s)]
*  Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal an affair. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=181.9s)]
*  He has pleaded not guilty to the allegations. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=186.2s)]
*  In Arizona, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers says they abhor high ticket prices. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  From member station KJZZ in Phoenix, Wayne Schatzke reports [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=195.2s)]
*  they're backing legislation to both rein in ticket-buying bots and regulate the ticket resale market. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=199.1s)]
*  Arizona House Republican David Cook's so-called Taylor Swift bill would ban the use of bots to purchase event tickets online. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=206.0s)]
*  A lobbyist for StubHub said there's no need for a state law because federal law already bans the practice. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=212.3s)]
*  But critics like Cook say the federal ban is ineffective. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=217.2s)]
*  Congress in Washington, D.C. likes to talk about things like they're actually doing something, but they don't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=220.3s)]
*  So Arizona is going to step up and protect consumers today. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=225.9s)]
*  Several Democrats cosponsored the bill, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=229.5s)]
*  which would give the Arizona attorney general the power to investigate alleged violations. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=231.6s)]
*  A second bill would ban ticket resellers from advertising a ticket for sale unless they actually own it beforehand. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=235.5s)]
*  Washington, Texas, and Michigan have passed similar restrictions in recent years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Wayne Schatzke in Phoenix. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=245.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman, NPR News. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aewQGvN79hE&t=247.60000000000002s)]
