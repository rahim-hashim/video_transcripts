# Trump's Rule Change Sends SHEIN, Temu Prices Soaring | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74)
*  A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=0.0s)]
*  migrants from South Texas is unlawful. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=5.48s)]
*  And President Trump has issued an executive order attempting to end federal funding for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=8.6s)]
*  NPR and PBS. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=12.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=15.64s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=16.64s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration is ending a duty-free exemption on low-value imports from China [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=20.18s)]
*  starting today. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=25.84s)]
*  That includes sites like Xi and Ertema. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=27.48s)]
*  And here's Emily Fang says the move will make those goods much more expensive for American [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=29.92s)]
*  consumers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=34.32s)]
*  There has been pressure since the Biden administration to end what's called the de minimis loophole, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=35.32s)]
*  meaning packages under $800 were not charged an import fee. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  More than one billion of these packages now come to the U.S. a year, mostly from China, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=44.78s)]
*  a more than six-fold increase from the last decade. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=49.84s)]
*  The Trump administration says it's now going to charge customs duties on packages from [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=53.56s)]
*  China in order to combat fentanyl trafficking and to collect revenue for the government. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=57.36s)]
*  American consumers are now sharing screenshots of the new import cost estimates they're [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=62.92s)]
*  getting on Tomo, which in most cases double or even triple the cost of their purchases [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=67.44s)]
*  from China. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=72.26s)]
*  And trade logistics companies are warning of massive delays in shipping in the coming [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  weeks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=77.72s)]
*  Emily Fang, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=78.72s)]
*  President Trump is set to propose a summary of his budget to Congress. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=81.84s)]
*  NPR has learned he'll propose $163 billion in spending cuts. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=85.56s)]
*  These cuts will be targeted at discretionary spending that does not involve defense spending. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=91.44s)]
*  The budget summary will be released later today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=96.48s)]
*  It's sometimes called a skinny budget. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=99.2s)]
*  It does not include federal spending on safety nets such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=100.92s)]
*  Security. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Governments often release a skinny budget proposal, followed later by the traditional [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=107.74s)]
*  full budget proposal that includes all spending and revenue projections. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=112.22s)]
*  A federal judge in Texas has ruled that President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to detain [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=117.02s)]
*  and deport certain Venezuelan immigrants from South Texas is unlawful. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=122.66s)]
*  NPR's Sergio Martinez Beltran reports this is the first time a federal judge has ruled [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=127.78s)]
*  the act cannot be used against the alleged gang members. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  The Venezuelan men in this Texas case are accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=136.02s)]
*  a Venezuelan gang that the president describes as invading the United States. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., a Trump appointee, wrote the administration [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  does not have the authority to detain the men. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=149.88s)]
*  That's because the gang's criminal activities, while harmful, do not constitute an invasion [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=152.74s)]
*  or predatory incursion as understood under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=157.78s)]
*  This decision covers all of the Southern District of Texas, which includes Brownsville, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=161.88s)]
*  McAllen and Houston. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=165.84s)]
*  Sergio Martinez Beltran, NPR News, Austin. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=167.88s)]
*  In Colorado, immigration authorities are proposing what appears to be the largest fines ever [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=171.4s)]
*  against three companies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=176.22s)]
*  From Colorado Public Radio, Ben Marcus has more. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=177.84s)]
*  The proposed fines come after audits by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=180.92s)]
*  More than $8 million in possible fines for employing unauthorized workers. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=185.62s)]
*  That includes a more than $6 million fine against CCS Denver, which provides janitorial [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=191.02s)]
*  services. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=196.68s)]
*  They refuse to comment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=197.86s)]
*  The other two companies penalized by ICE could not be located, and a spokesperson for the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=199.56s)]
*  agency did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=204.34s)]
*  President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has promised a 400% increase in workplace [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  enforcement actions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=214.06s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Ben Marcus in Denver. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=216.08s)]
*  President Trump is replacing his national security adviser, Mike Walz. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=218.96s)]
*  He'll nominate him as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=222.46s)]
*  And Piers Asmohallad reports this is the first major staff shakeup of Trump's second term. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=226.10000000000002s)]
*  Walz has been under pressure since March when he inadvertently added a journalist to a text [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=231.06s)]
*  chain about U.S. military strikes in Yemen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  But Vice President J.D. Vance told Fox News this change had nothing to do with that group [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=239.9s)]
*  chat incident. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  The media wants to frame this as a firing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=246.26s)]
*  Donald Trump has fired a lot of people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=249.0s)]
*  He doesn't give them Senate-confirmed appointments afterwards. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=250.92s)]
*  Vance also insisted this move is not indicative of an ideological fight in the administration, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=253.48s)]
*  though Walz is known as being more hawkish than many others in Trump's inner circle. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=259.8s)]
*  The president also announced that for the time being, Secretary Marco Rubio will take [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=264.96s)]
*  on the role of national security adviser while also maintaining his job leading the State [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=269.44s)]
*  Department. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=274.52s)]
*  Asmohallad, NPR News. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=275.62s)]
*  President Trump has issued an executive order that attempts to end federal funding for NPR [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  and PBS accusing the organizations of political bias. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=283.06s)]
*  NPR's Ryland Barton reports it's the latest attack on public media by the Trump administration. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=286.94s)]
*  Trump is ordering the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop sending money to NPR [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=292.5s)]
*  and PBS, and he's banning local public radio and TV stations from using taxpayer dollars [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=296.94s)]
*  to support the news organizations. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=302.06s)]
*  The president says federal funding should not support what he calls biased and partisan [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=304.4s)]
*  news coverage. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=308.44s)]
*  CPB is the independent nonprofit that Congress funds to partially pay for public broadcasting. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=309.64s)]
*  And currently, NPR receives about 1% of its funding directly from CPB, and PBS gets about [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=315.2s)]
*  15%. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  Earlier this week, Trump moved to fire three of CPB's board members. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=322.04s)]
*  They're suing, saying they're not a federal agency and don't serve at the pleasure of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=326.0s)]
*  the president. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=329.84s)]
*  Ryland Barton, NPR News. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=330.84s)]
*  Beef agencies are warning loudly food is running out in Gaza. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=333.32s)]
*  Some are warning of famine. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=337.74s)]
*  Israel has blocked all aid into Gaza for the past two months. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  The World Food Program says this is the longest closure by Israel since the war started. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=343.42s)]
*  The organizations are demanding that Israel comply with international law. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=348.94s)]
*  Israel says it's trying to force Hamas to release hostages. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=353.74s)]
*  Western movie Rust, starring and co-produced by actor Alec Baldwin, is debuting in movie [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=357.74s)]
*  theaters today. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=363.64s)]
*  It's been three years since the film's original cinematographer, Helena Hutchins, was killed [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=365.12s)]
*  on set. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=369.24s)]
*  And Beers-Mondolit Del Barco has more. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=370.52s)]
*  Alec Baldwin plays the outlaw Harlan Rust in the fictional film set in the 1800s. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  Some things in this life you can't get back, I reckon. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=377.66s)]
*  During production, Baldwin pointed the prop gun that went off killing Helena Hutchins. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=380.54s)]
*  The film's armorer is serving prison time, but Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=384.92s)]
*  was dismissed. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=389.56s)]
*  Director Joel Sousa, who was shot in the shoulder, returned to finish Rust. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=391.24s)]
*  Obviously the human cost and the tragedy of it overshadows everything. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=394.96000000000004s)]
*  I guess I just wonder if people will sort of see past that and engage with it as a film [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=399.72s)]
*  or if it will be a thing where people just can't ever separate the movie from what happened [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=404.36s)]
*  during its filming. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=408.8s)]
*  After premiering at a film festival in Poland, Rust now has a limited theatrical release [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7QD9Gdu74&t=410.20000000000005s)]
