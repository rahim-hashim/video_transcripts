# Trump, Musk Tout DOGE's Work To Slash Spending | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, February 12th. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=0.0s)]
*  here are today's top stories. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=5.28s)]
*  Russia is providing some additional detail into an agreement with the White House that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=7.28s)]
*  led to the release of U.S. schoolteacher Mark Fogel from a Russian prison. The Kremlin now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  says the Trump administration agreed to release a Russian national in exchange. NPR's Charles [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=15.58s)]
*  Maynes has details. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=20.62s)]
*  Speaking to reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had secured the freedom [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=22.0s)]
*  of a Russian national currently in U.S. custody, but he refused to identify the individual [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=26.6s)]
*  until he or she was back on Russian soil. Peskov also said he viewed the prisoner swap as a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=31.64s)]
*  trust-building measure rather than a breakthrough in relations. The exchange was negotiated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  during a covert trip to Moscow by White House Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, the first confirmed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=41.52s)]
*  direct high-level contact between the U.S. and Russia since the Kremlin launched its invasion [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  of Ukraine nearly three years ago. President Trump has expressed hope the deal marks what [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=50.88s)]
*  he called the beginning of a relationship that leads to an end to the war. Charles Maynes [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=55.58s)]
*  in PYRNEWS. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=60.1s)]
*  President Trump has signed a new executive order that lays out how the Doge Initiative [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=61.46s)]
*  will help cut government spending. Trump appeared at the White House yesterday with Doge's leader, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=65.5s)]
*  billionaire Elon Musk. Trump says despite court rulings slowing cuts in spending and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  the federal workforce, he hopes judges will side with him. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=75.7s)]
*  I hope that the court system is going to allow us to do what we have to do. We got elected [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=79.22s)]
*  to, among other things, find all of this fraud, abuse, all of this horrible stuff going on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=84.74s)]
*  And we've already found billions of dollars. Not like a little bit. Billions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=92.02s)]
*  Trump provided no evidence of any fraud or abuse. Meanwhile, the White House has fired [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=96.78s)]
*  the Inspector General of the agency USAID. That happened one day after Inspector General [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  Paul Martin's office released a critical report on Trump's work to dismantle USAID. The report [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=107.38s)]
*  says this makes it pretty much impossible for the agency to monitor more than $8 billion [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=113.30000000000001s)]
*  in unspent humanitarian aid. It means the aid could fall into the wrong hands. Trump's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=119.14s)]
*  top immigration adviser doesn't think the government is deporting migrants quickly enough. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  Border Czar Tom Homan says he wants federal agents to work faster. And PYRNEWS Adrian [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=130.02s)]
*  Florido has more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  Speaking outside the White House, Homan claimed the government is making deportation arrests [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=136.06s)]
*  at three times the rate of the Biden administration. That would be about a thousand a day. He called [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=140.46s)]
*  that good. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=145.82s)]
*  But I'm not satisfied. There's more criminal aliens that need to be arrested. Hundreds [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=146.54s)]
*  of thousands. Sanctuary cities are putting roadblocks up. We got leaks. So we need to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=150.42s)]
*  increase the arrests of illegal aliens, especially those with criminal convictions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=154.98s)]
*  Homan's recently been vocal about his anger at obstacles agents have faced. Officials [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=158.62s)]
*  in sanctuary cities unwilling to help. A large raid in Colorado that fell flat after plans [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=163.1s)]
*  were leaked to the press. His comments come amid reports that two top officials at Immigration [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  and Customs Enforcement have been demoted over the pace of deportations. Adrian Florido [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=173.98s)]
*  and PYRNEWS. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=179.06s)]
*  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has just announced the shortlist for its 20-25 class of inductees. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  The list features a Southern rap duo, a Mexican rock band and a Brit pop supergroup. And Pyrs [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=186.57999999999998s)]

*  half of those are on the list for the first time. That includes Atlanta rap duo Outkast, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=201.26s)]
*  the Mexican rock band Mana, and English rocker Billy Idol. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=209.82s)]
*  The list also features past contenders like Mariah Carey, Soundgarden, Cyndi Lauper, and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=216.82s)]
*  Oasis. The final list will be announced in April with an induction ceremony to follow [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rn-vMGVq38&t=227.14s)]
