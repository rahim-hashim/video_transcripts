# Tens Of Thousands Continue To Flee Nagorno-Karabakh | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY)
*  The White House is hosting a climate resilience summit today, and tens of thousands of people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=0.0s)]
*  continue to flee Azerbaijan's ethnically Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=5.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=10.88s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=11.88s)]
*  The second Republican presidential debate last night, moderated by Fox Business, had [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=14.9s)]
*  multiple chaotic moments as seven candidates tried to make themselves heard. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  It's not the fault of anybody who's involved. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=23.76s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=27.6s)]
*  Thank you for speaking while I'm interrupting. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=28.6s)]
*  Literally. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=30.16s)]
*  Well, literally, you said by paper. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=31.16s)]
*  If I may finish. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  If I may finish. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Laven reports the debate was at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  in California. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Trump, who is leading the field in early states by a wide margin, did not participate in the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  debate. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=45.36s)]
*  Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis did attack [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  him for that, with Christie telling Trump he was quote, afraid of defending his record. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Democrats also attacked Trump for his spending in office, as well as his refusal to state [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=56.92s)]
*  a clear position on abortion in this primary. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=60.56s)]
*  But the Republicans on stage mostly avoided attacking the former president. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  Instead, many trained their attacks on President Joe Biden, particularly on the topic of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  economy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=71.8s)]
*  The next debate will be on November 8th in Miami, Florida. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=72.94s)]
*  Danielle Kurtz-Laven, NPR News, Simi Valley, California. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=76.04s)]
*  Trump spent the evening attending a rally in Michigan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=79.4s)]
*  He spoke to supporters at a non-union auto parts supplier facility. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=81.8s)]
*  As more people experience the effects of wildfires and extreme weather fueled by climate [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=86.84s)]
*  change, the White House is hosting a climate resilience summit today. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=91.08s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brady reports the Biden administration invited officials from 25 states, territories, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=95.2s)]
*  and tribes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=101.0s)]
*  Responding to a climate-related disaster requires cooperation between governments. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=102.0s)]
*  This summit is designed to encourage that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=106.0s)]
*  Ali Zaidi is the White House climate policy advisor and says representatives from Democratic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=108.4s)]
*  and Republican states are attending. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=113.44s)]
*  The summit marks really the first time that any administration has hosted a major convening [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=115.32s)]
*  like this focused exclusively on climate resilience. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=120.96s)]
*  The White House will highlight more than a half billion dollars in assistance to help [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=124.32s)]
*  local governments plan for climate disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=128.0s)]
*  Other topics include reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, strengthening the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  power grid, and overhauling building codes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=136.56s)]
*  Jeff Brady, NPR News. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=139.56s)]
*  Officials in Armenia say that more than 65,000 ethnic Armenians are fleeing the enclave of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=141.6s)]
*  Nagorno-Karabakh. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=147.92s)]
*  Rival Azerbaijan's military took it over last week. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=149.88s)]
*  NPR's Philip Reeves tells us there's only one road to get out of the enclave. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=153.56s)]
*  People are continuing this morning to come down that road just as they have been for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=159.04s)]
*  the last four days in cars, buses, even garbage trucks and tractors. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=162.32s)]
*  A few days ago a fuel depot in Nagorno-Karabakh exploded, killing more than 60 people and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=167.76s)]
*  that's created a shortage of gas so some people are just walking. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=173.4s)]
*  They're bringing their farm animals, chickens, goats and so on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=177.72s)]
*  Now this is usually by car, a journey of five or six hours, but the road's been jammed and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=180.64s)]
*  so it's taking far longer than that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Philip Reeves. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=187.72s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1d7UPJMnvY&t=189.72s)]
