# Student Protesters Occupy Columbia University Building | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0)
*  Students are refusing to back down as pro-Palestinian protests intensify at campuses across the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal appeals court has ruled against two state mandates that restrict gender-affirming care. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=8.24s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=14.64s)]
*  Student protesters at colleges and universities across the nation are ramping up their calls to end Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  In New York City, students at Columbia University have barricaded themselves into a building that was the site of demonstrations in the 1960s. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=29.68s)]
*  NPR's Brian Mann reports the university is now threatening to suspend students. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=42.4s)]
*  Students are still maintaining that core encampment on the campus green and they're inside Hamilton Hall, dozens of students right now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  What appears clear is that this effort by Columbia University to try to end this by pressuring students with the threat of discipline, so far that appears to have backfired. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=55.04s)]
*  That's NPR's Brian Mann reporting from Columbia University. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=63.839999999999996s)]

*  The Biden administration says not enough aid is getting into the region over land, so the U.S. military is building a floating pier offshore. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=76.88s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Frere reports from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=86.88s)]
*  U.S. Central Command shared photos on social media of U.S. troops building this floating pier off the north coast of Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=90.64s)]
*  It's got a helipad, forklifts, and shipping containers on deck. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  The plan is for aid to be loaded onto commercial ships in Cyprus. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  They'll sail to this platform where pallets will be loaded onto trucks, which will then drive onto smaller ships that'll connect to a metal floating causeway attached to Gaza's shore by the Israeli military. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=105.92s)]
*  The Pentagon says it'll cost at least $320 million and be up and running next month. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=117.68s)]
*  In the aftermath of Hamas' October 7th attack, Israel has restricted food, water, and medicine deliveries to Gaza's more than 2 million residents, and the U.N. says famine is imminent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=123.28s)]
*  Lauren Frere, NPR News Tel Aviv. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=134.32s)]
*  The federal appeals court has issued a ruling in favor of transgender patients in North Carolina and West Virginia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=136.64s)]
*  NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin reports, advocates say it's a huge victory. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=145.28s)]
*  The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard two cases, one from North Carolina, the other from West Virginia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=150.4s)]
*  In an 8-6 decision, the majority decided that trans patients enrolled in state health plans are entitled to coverage for gender-affirming care. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=156.4s)]
*  The opinion called the denial of coverage, quote, obviously discriminatory. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=165.44s)]
*  Tara Barelli argued the case for the plaintiffs. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  She's senior counsel with Lambda Legal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=172.88s)]
*  We're absolutely thrilled that the court ruled that discriminatory treatment just has no place under the law. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=175.12s)]
*  Both states have condemned the decision and suggested that they will appeal to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=183.36s)]
*  Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz5Y4oaW1C0&t=188.88000000000002s)]
