# Biden Raises $25 Million At New York Fundraiser | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM)
*  Ports along the East Coast are preparing for an increase in cargo ship traffic after Baltimore's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=0.0s)]
*  Key Bridge collapsed this week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=5.16s)]
*  And President Biden raised $25 million at a campaign event last night in New York. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=7.74s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=12.68s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=13.68s)]
*  The Biden administration is releasing $60 million in federal aid to Maryland. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=17.2s)]
*  That's to recover from this week's collapse of the massive Francis Scott Key Bridge after [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=21.66s)]
*  it was hit by a cargo ship. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=26.32s)]
*  Four people are still missing and presumed dead. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=28.3s)]
*  Two other people were killed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=31.04s)]
*  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is sending the biggest crane on the East Coast to clear [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  the shipping channel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=37.42s)]
*  The Key Bridge has to be chopped into pieces and all debris removed from the river. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=38.78s)]
*  The Port of Baltimore remains closed indefinitely because of the bridge collapse. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=43.74s)]
*  That means other East Coast ports are preparing for an increase in cargo ship traffic. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  Georgia Public Broadcasting's Benjamin Payne reports that includes the city of Savannah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=53.5s)]
*  Savannah is home to the second busiest container port along the eastern seaboard, behind only [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=58.58s)]
*  the port of New York and New Jersey. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=62.74s)]
*  Mayor Van Johnson assured Georgians this week that cargo ships passing beneath the bridge [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=64.78s)]
*  along the Savannah River are escorted by local captains who know the ins and outs of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=68.88s)]
*  waterway. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=73.1s)]
*  I think our residents couldn't feel safe again. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=74.1s)]
*  I've been on these ships with these river pilots. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=76.94s)]
*  They navigate a much narrower waterway than was in Baltimore, and they do it with skill [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=79.38s)]
*  and precision. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=85.02s)]
*  Unlike the Key Bridge in Baltimore, the support columns for Savannah's bridge are located [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  off to the shore rather than within the waters of the shipping channel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=90.25999999999999s)]

*  Clinton talked up Biden's economic moves as well as his efforts to try and work across [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=142.18s)]

*  Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is promising their own historic night. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=148.86s)]
*  Trump and the Republican Party are teaming up for a fundraiser in Palm Beach next week. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=152.7s)]

*  Hundreds more protesters gathered outside the New York event. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=169.74s)]
*  You're committing genocide! [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FgjejJCwwM&t=173.86s)]
