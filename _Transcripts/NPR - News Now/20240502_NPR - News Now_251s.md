# Police Continue To Crackdown On Campus Anti-War Protests | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo)
*  Hundreds of officers in riot gear descended on an anti-war encampment on the UCLA campus [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=0.0s)]
*  this morning and the UN says tons of undetonated bombs scattered across Gaza pose a threat [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  as ceasefire talks continue. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=12.08s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=14.42s)]
*  At the UCLA campus in Los Angeles, police are using flashbangs as they dismantle barricades [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  and clear out the protestor encampment against Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=27.2s)]
*  Several people have been detained, this after police told them to leave or face arrest. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Some schools around the country have used police to clear encampments and more than [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=36.68s)]
*  a thousand have been arrested. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=40.2s)]
*  At Columbia University in New York, the school has asked police to remain on campus for at [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=42.08s)]
*  least two weeks after they cleared a building protesters had taken over. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=46.7s)]
*  And Piers Martin-Costy has more. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=51.68s)]
*  The police are definitely sounding more willing to get into the fray now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=53.32s)]
*  The NYPD put out sort of a triumphant video after the operation at Columbia with kind [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=56.72s)]
*  of dramatic music and it ends with this stark warning for protesters. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=60.76s)]
*  In the video there they say if protesters try this kind of thing again they will be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=65.48s)]
*  extracted and taken to jail. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  And Piers Martin-Costy reporting, police involvement varies around the country depending on when [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=71.3s)]
*  and if schools call them in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=75.92s)]
*  Negotiations continue today between Israel and Hamas through their intermediaries over [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=78.6s)]
*  a ceasefire proposal that could allow some Palestinians to return to their homes in the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=83.74s)]
*  northern Gaza Strip. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=89.06s)]
*  But the United Nations is warning about the danger of unexploded ordnance if and when [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=90.78s)]
*  that happens. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=95.24s)]
*  And Piers Lauren Frayer has more from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=96.58s)]
*  The UN says 7,500 tons of unexploded ordnance may be scattered across the Gaza Strip and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=98.82s)]
*  that risk of injury is now at its quote most dangerous stage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=105.22s)]
*  Let's say about 10% of explosives do not detonate initially. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=109.94000000000001s)]
*  UN teams have found 1,000 pound bombs unexploded at Gaza's main intersections and inside schools. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=113.78s)]
*  Palestinian officials say smaller munitions have been hidden in booby-trapped canned goods [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  and that a 14-year-old boy had his limbs amputated when one of them went off. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=126.5s)]
*  Without enough bomb disposal equipment, the UN and NGOs are mapping danger spots and trying [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=131.58s)]
*  to alert residents through leaflets and on social media. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=137.14s)]
*  Lauren Frayer, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=140.61999999999998s)]
*  Another hearing will be held this morning on additional sanctions against former President [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump for allegedly violating the judge's gag order in his hush money trial preventing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=148.38s)]
*  him from criticizing witnesses or jurors. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  Prosecutors are seeking $4,000. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=157.5s)]
*  That's on top of a $9,000 fine already imposed this week in a separate gag order violation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=159.94s)]
*  President Biden heads to North Carolina today where he will tout the strong economy while [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=167.54s)]
*  visiting Wilmington. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=172.22s)]
*  But first, he will stop in Charlotte to meet with the families of four law enforcement [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=173.82s)]
*  officers shot to death Monday while serving a warrant. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=177.82s)]
*  That meeting is expected to take place behind closed doors to respect the privacy of grieving [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=181.34s)]
*  family members. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=185.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democratic voters are increasingly supportive of abortion rights and increasingly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=187.42s)]
*  motivated by the issue. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=192.26s)]
*  That's according to a new report from the Public Religion Research Institute. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=194.26s)]
*  Imperial Sarah McCammon reports those findings align with the results of election exit polls [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=198.5s)]
*  since the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade almost two years ago. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=202.94s)]
*  A majority of voters, 64 percent, say they support legal access to abortion in most or [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=207.74s)]
*  all cases. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=213.5s)]
*  Public Religion Research Institute CEO Melissa Deckman says a majority support abortion access [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=215.28s)]
*  even in many states where the procedure is heavily restricted. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=220.56s)]
*  So the policies that are being enacted in many red state legislatures where Republicans [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=224.16s)]
*  control majorities are clearly out of step with what the citizens in those states would [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=228.64s)]
*  like to see. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  The poll found that Democrats say they're increasingly motivated by the abortion issue. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=235.36s)]
*  That's especially true for women and younger voters, two groups who lean toward the Democratic [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=240.16s)]
*  Party. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=244.68s)]
*  Sarah McCammon, NPR News. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=245.68s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBvX0Tq_ZOo&t=247.76000000000002s)]
