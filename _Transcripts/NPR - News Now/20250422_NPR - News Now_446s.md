*  Now the Trump administration says the Education Department will begin collections next month. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXsO0ehmo34&t=413.32s)]
*  It could also begin garnishing wages from borrowers, meaning a portion of their paycheck [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXsO0ehmo34&t=418.04s)]
*  would automatically be sent to the federal government. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXsO0ehmo34&t=422.6s)]
*  Linda McMahon, the education secretary, says quote, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXsO0ehmo34&t=425.40000000000003s)]
