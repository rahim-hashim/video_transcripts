# Fauci Set To Testify On COVID-19's Origins Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg)
*  Live from NPR News, I'm Korva Coleman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. Anthony Fauci is scheduled to appear before a House committee today. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=2.64s)]
*  Fauci helped oversee the federal government's response to COVID-19, and he served as chief [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=5.96s)]
*  medical adviser to President Biden before retiring. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=10.56s)]
*  As NPR's Jeff Brumfield reports, the House committee is investigating the origins of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=13.72s)]
*  the coronavirus. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=17.96s)]
*  House Republicans have been investigating grants, emails, and connections between government [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=19.2s)]
*  scientists and an organization called EcoHealth Alliance, which was working in China when [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=23.3s)]
*  the pandemic began. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=27.88s)]
*  Earlier this month, the Biden administration suspended EcoHealth's funding because of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=29.36s)]
*  grant irregularities found by the committee. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=33.6s)]
*  Fauci will likely get a lot of pointed questions about any connections he had to EcoHealth, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=36.12s)]
*  but many scientists say these lawmakers are looking at the wrong thing. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=41.7s)]
*  Michael Warby is an expert in virus origins at the University of Arizona. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=46.28s)]
*  This select subcommittee could have used its powers to actually try to understand the scientific [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  evidence. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  He says probing old grant applications is unlikely to show how the pandemic actually [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=58.02s)]
*  began. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=63.34s)]
*  Jeff Brumfield, NPR News. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=64.34s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump says he could face jail time or House arrest following his [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=66.18s)]
*  criminal fraud convictions in New York last week and would be okay with it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=70.38s)]
*  But in an interview airing on Fox News yesterday, Trump warned his supporters could reach a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  quote breaking point. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  He did not explain. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=80.58s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson says Republican lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=82.26s)]
*  plan to review all the criminal cases against Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=86.64s)]
*  The purpose of the hearing is to investigate what these prosecutors are doing at the state [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=89.88s)]
*  and federal level to go to use politics, you know, political retribution in the court system [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=94.4s)]
*  to go after political opponents of federal officials like Donald Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=99.64s)]
*  That's a really important thing for us to delve into. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=103.5s)]
*  And we're going to look at special counsel Jack Smith, who we believe is abusing his [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  authority as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=110.6s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson spoke on Fox News Sunday. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=111.6s)]
*  Hunter Biden goes on trial today in Delaware on federal firearm charges. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  President Biden's son is accused of lying about his illegal drug use when he bought [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=120.28s)]
*  a gun six years ago. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  The case centers around a Colt revolver Hunter Biden purchased in October of 2018. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  Prosecutors say Biden lied about his illegal drug use on a background check form he filled [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=134.16s)]
*  out when buying the gun. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=137.78s)]
*  He faces two counts of making false statements and one count of illegal possession of a firearm [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=139.54000000000002s)]
*  by a drug user or addict. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  The case was brought by Justice Department Special Counsel David Weiss. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  The trial in Delaware comes less than a year after a tentative deal with prosecutors that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=149.76s)]
*  would have allowed Biden to avoid trial entirely fell apart. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=154.32s)]
*  Weiss also has separately brought tax charges against the president's son in a case in California. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=157.88s)]
*  That's scheduled for trial in September. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=162.88s)]
*  But first, there's a gun case in Delaware, which is expected to last up to two weeks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=165.0s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=169.28s)]
*  In India, exit polls suggest that incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=171.72s)]
*  win a historic third term in office. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=176.94s)]
*  This comes after a marathon six weeks of voting across India. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=179.94s)]
*  Amkar Kadankar reports nearly a billion people were eligible to cast a ballot. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=183.68s)]
*  Exit polls on the Indian TV news channel show that the alliance led by the Prime Minister [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=189.12s)]
*  Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP party is likely to win nearly two-thirds of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  seats in the lower house of the Indian parliament. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=198.68s)]
*  This would give Narendra Modi a third consecutive term, a first for an Indian Prime Minister [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=201.88s)]
*  in 60 years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=206.56s)]
*  The opposition India bloc dismissed the results and said they will form a government. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=208.32s)]
*  A spokesperson for the opposition Congress party also accused the Home Minister Amit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=212.88s)]
*  Shah of personally calling up dozens of senior polling officers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=217.12s)]
*  He says that was to intimidate them ahead of tallying votes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=221.32s)]
*  The results of the Indian elections will be declared on 4th June. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=225.36s)]
*  For NPR News, this is Amkar Khandekar in Mumbai. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=228.96s)]
*  Mexico has a new president-elect. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  It's Claudio Sheinbaum. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=234.72000000000003s)]
*  NPR's Ider Peralta reports Sheinbaum will be Mexico's first female leader and it's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=236.52s)]
*  more than 200-year history. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  Preliminary results from Mexico's electoral commission show that Claudio Sheinbaum, an [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=243.96s)]
*  environmental engineer turned politician, has an irreversible lead in the polls. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  On the streets here in the Zocalo, it is being celebrated as a woman breaking the highest [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=254.16s)]
*  of glass ceilings. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=259.76s)]
*  And this is all happening in a country that is notoriously machista, in a country with [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=261.24s)]
*  one of the highest rates of murder against women. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=266.08s)]
*  But now, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, the 61-year-old former mayor of Mexico City, who has grandparents [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  who escaped the Holocaust, will become the first woman to hold the most powerful office [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=275.24s)]
*  in the country. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=280.36s)]
*  Ider Peralta, NPR News in the Zocalo, in Mexico City. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFndh0-aTqg&t=281.40000000000003s)]
