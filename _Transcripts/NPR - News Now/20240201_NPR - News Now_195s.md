# E.U. Approves $54 Billion In Fresh Aid For Ukraine | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0)
*  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has cleared the way for billions in fresh aid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=0.0s)]
*  from the European Union to Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=4.72s)]
*  And the U.S. House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan tax package. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=7.32s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=11.84s)]
*  I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=12.84s)]
*  The European Union has sealed a deal on aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=16.44s)]
*  EU leaders clinched the agreement just an hour after they began a summit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=19.56s)]
*  And Piers Eleanor Beardsley reports the deal came quickly after Hungary lifted its veto. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=23.68s)]
*  Hungary had been the only EU nation blocking the funding, which must be approved unanimously. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=29.24s)]
*  Ahead of the summit, Estonian Prime Minister Kaya Kalas expressed her frustration at Hungarian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=34.76s)]
*  Prime Minister Viktor Orban. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  I mean, Viktor definitely wants to be the center of attention every time we are here, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=42.32s)]
*  but it shouldn't be like this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=48.56s)]
*  To everyone's surprise, Hungary quickly reversed its stance to support the roughly $54 billion [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=50.08s)]
*  which will help Kiev keep its economy running in 2024 and sustain essential services such [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=56.6s)]
*  as health care, education, social protection and pensions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=61.96s)]
*  Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=65.64s)]
*  The European Union's aid to Ukraine comes as American aid to Ukraine stalls in Congress. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=67.68s)]
*  Republicans say they won't pass foreign aid to help Ukraine or Israel unless Congress [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=73.68s)]
*  and the president first deal with U.S. border security. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=78.68s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says lawmakers are still negotiating a bipartisan [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=82.48s)]
*  immigration bill to speed action on Ukraine relief. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  We have not concluded negotiations, so we will keep going to get this done. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=90.56s)]
*  Democrats have always been ready and willing to have a debate on the border. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  We want to get this done. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has appeared to float the idea of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  splitting aid to Ukraine and Israel away from border security measures. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=107.32s)]
*  We had a lot of discussion obviously about the border around here, but it's important [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=112.08s)]
*  to focus on the other rationale for the supplemental. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=115.88s)]
*  We've got two friends in the middle of a huge fight, Israel, Ukraine. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  They need help. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=128.44s)]
*  But it's not clear if that view will win support from hard-lying congressional Republicans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=129.48s)]
*  In an overwhelming vote, the House has advanced a major tax package. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=135.06s)]
*  It offers a three-year expansion of the child tax credit and significant business tax cuts. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=139.52s)]
*  NPR's Eric McDaniel reports as many as half a million children could be lifted from poverty. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=144.82000000000002s)]
*  With a margin of 357 in favor, a 70 opposed, this bill was popular. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=151.02s)]
*  But because of an anti-compromise set of House Republicans who blocked a procedural step, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=156.24s)]
*  it also sort of had to be. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=160.38s)]
*  It passed under something called suspension of the rules that requires a two-thirds vote [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=162.1s)]
*  of approval in the House. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=166.14s)]
*  Bills usually just require a simple majority. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  And in addition to Republican opposition, some Democrats voted against it because of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=170.78s)]
*  the more limited scope of the child tax credit expansion, which lifts fewer kids from poverty [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=174.82s)]
*  than a COVID-19 era version. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=179.94s)]
*  Many Republicans, including Speaker Mike Johnson, were brought along to support by substantial [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  tax cuts for corporations. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=186.82s)]
*  Eric McDaniel, NPR News Washington. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm958YLDf_0&t=191.36s)]
