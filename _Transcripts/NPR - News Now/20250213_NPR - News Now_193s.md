*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=10.4s)]
*  The ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza appears to be back on track after a few days [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=14.64s)]
*  of uncertainty. Earlier this week, Hamas said it would delay the scheduled release of three [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=20.0s)]
*  Israeli hostages on Saturday. Hamas had accused Israel of violating the ceasefire. Israel denied [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=25.04s)]
*  that. And Piers Katlansdorf has more from Tel Aviv. Mediators have been hard at work after Israel [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  threatened to return to war if the hostages weren't released on time. Now, signals from all sides seem [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=36.48s)]
*  to suggest the disagreement has been solved. Mahmoud Mardawi, a senior Hamas leader, told NPR, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=42.480000000000004s)]

*  there's another significant issue. Illegal immigration is a big priority for Trump, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=89.28s)]
*  and according to estimates from the Pew Research Center, the third largest group of people in the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=94.48s)]
*  United States without legal status are actually Indians. Earlier this month, the Trump administration [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  flew a group of Indians back to India on a military plane, so I do expect immigration and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=104.56s)]
*  trade, of course, to be major issues because these are major fixations for President Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=109.76s)]
*  But other issues that are likely to come up are technology and defense cooperation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Gx9BD3VJs&t=114.4s)]
