# World Delegates Meet To Try To End Plastics Pollution | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s)
*  Delegates from around the world are meeting to try to solve the problem of plastic pollution. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=0.0s)]
*  And the FAA says a shortage of air traffic controllers could put a snag in some Americans' [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=5.0s)]
*  travel plans this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=9.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Now that former Congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his nomination to be attorney general, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=16.2s)]
*  lawmakers are turning their attention to some of President-elect Donald Trump's other cabinet [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=20.76s)]
*  nominees. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=25.2s)]
*  Trump named former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to serve as U.S. Attorney General [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=26.52s)]
*  when Gaetz dropped out amid allegations of sexual misconduct. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=31.04s)]
*  He denies the accusations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=35.22s)]
*  And Piers Mara-Liason has more. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=37.1s)]
*  It's very common for new presidents to withdraw one or more nominations. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=39.12s)]
*  Now the question is whether withdrawing Gaetz makes it easier or harder to get Trump's other [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=43.0s)]
*  nominees confirmed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=47.8s)]
*  Republican senators may be less inclined to reject Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=50.08s)]
*  nominee for defense secretary. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=55.2s)]
*  Hegseth was the subject of a sexual assault investigation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=57.28s)]
*  He has denied the allegations. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  And there's Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=62.92s)]
*  In the past, Gabbard has been sympathetic to Vladimir Putin and Syrian dictator Bashar [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=67.16s)]
*  al-Assad. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=72.12s)]
*  She has repeated Russian talking points, blaming Ukraine and NATO for Russia's invasion of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=73.34s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=77.92s)]
*  Senators on the Intelligence Committee will want to question her about that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  Mara-Liason, NPR News. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=83.0s)]
*  Among Donald Trump's latest nominees is Brooke Rollins to run the Department of Agriculture. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=85.2s)]
*  Rollins is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=90.84s)]
*  It is a think tank that supports Trump's policy agenda. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=95.04s)]
*  Staff at a hospital in north Gaza say repeated attacks by Israeli drones have wounded multiple [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  medical workers and damaged facilities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=103.84s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports the injured include the hospital director. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=106.56s)]
*  The director of the Besieged Kamal Adwan Hospital, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiyah, has been appealing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=110.62s)]
*  to the world in video messages for weeks now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Usually he sits in an office. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  But in his most recent videos, he's in a hospital bed, struggling to speak. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=119.12s)]
*  He explains that shrapnel from a bomb dropped by an Israeli quadcopter drone tore through [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=127.36s)]
*  a main artery in his leg, leading to severe blood loss. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=131.52s)]
*  He says he needs a specialist and calls for the international community to help the hospital. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=134.8s)]
*  Drones have attacked the hospital several times in recent days, including the generator [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=139.56s)]
*  and other key infrastructure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=143.32s)]
*  The Israeli military says it's unaware of the attack on Dr. Abu Safiyah, but that Hamas [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=145.16s)]
*  has been operating from the hospital. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=149.24s)]
*  Hamas rejects that claim. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=150.84s)]

*  Luis Valdecivio of the UN's Committee on Plastics Pollution says the problem can only be solved [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=162.44s)]
*  in a multilateral way. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=168.88s)]
*  Let us harness every tool of multilateralism, every ounce of creativity and every moment [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=171.08s)]
*  of dialogue to overcome our differences and craft a treaty as ambitious our collective [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktlnlJq68s&t=178.92000000000002s)]
