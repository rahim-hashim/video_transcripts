# Suspect Faces Federal Charges In CEO's Death | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI)
*  The federal government is set to partially shut down late tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=0.0s)]
*  And after Australia banned social media for kids under 16 last month, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=3.54s)]
*  officials are telling the platforms to plan for a new age verification requirement. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=8.06s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=12.88s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=15.68s)]
*  The federal government could partially shut down late tonight [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=17.48s)]
*  because there isn't any money to pay the bills. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=20.28s)]
*  The House failed last night to pass a short-term spending bill [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=22.48s)]
*  backed by President-elect Trump and his billionaire ally, Elon Musk. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Nearly all the Democrats opposed it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=29.32s)]
*  They're livid because Republicans backed out of a bipartisan spending plan this week [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=31.16s)]
*  after Musk and Trump objected to it at the last minute. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  But the new spending plan failed when 38 Republicans joined the Democrats to vote no, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=38.68s)]
*  including Texas Congressman Chip Roy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=44.28s)]
*  I want appropriators and leadership who are always the ones who are obstacles [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=46.64s)]
*  to actually cutting spending to pony up and explain why they won't agree [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=50.6s)]
*  to the spending cuts that we said we should put in place. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=55.16s)]
*  Trump is furious. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=57.6s)]
*  Writing online, he's called for a challenger to face Roy in a primary election. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  But Trump supports the looming government shutdown. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=63.2s)]
*  He says it's better for the country to close [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=66.4s)]
*  than to agree to what Democrats want to, quote, force upon us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  The suspect accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=73.0s)]
*  has appeared in federal court in New York City. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=77.08s)]
*  Luigi Mangione was already indicted by a New York grand jury [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  on murder and terrorism charges. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=83.2s)]
*  NPR's Sarah Ventry reports Mangione now faces federal counts. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  The federal charges include murder and two counts of stalking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=89.72s)]
*  The unsealed complaint filed in the Southern District of New York [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=93.64s)]
*  includes a timeline of Mangione's alleged movements. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=96.92s)]
*  It states that the shooter, quote, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  undertook extensive efforts to identify the victim, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=101.84s)]
*  place the victim under surveillance, and track the victim's whereabouts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  In a statement, Mangione's attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  says the federal government's decision to, quote, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  pile on top of an already overcharged first degree murder and state terror case [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  is highly unusual and raises serious constitutional [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=119.56s)]
*  and statutory double jeopardy concerns. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=123.08s)]
*  Sarah Ventry, NPR News, New York. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=126.08s)]
*  The Teamsters Union has called strikes at seven Amazon facilities across the country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  The union wants the online retailer to come to the bargaining table [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=134.56s)]
*  to hammer out labor contracts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=138.16s)]
*  Some of the people who are striking work for Amazon, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=140.44s)]
*  but others work for third-party companies. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=143.72s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Xu reports the company rejects the union's position. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=146.68s)]
*  Amazon has called this a PR play on the part of the Teamsters. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=151.84s)]
*  The company has disputed that the Teamsters even represents these thousands of workers. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=155.92s)]
*  And part of the issue is those third-party drivers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=161.44s)]
*  Amazon says they're not company employees, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=164.6s)]
*  but this has been a subject of litigation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  The Teamsters and federal labor officials have argued that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=170.04s)]
*  even though these drivers are not direct employees of Amazon, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=173.24s)]
*  they only work for Amazon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=177.16s)]
*  Amazon controls their wages and their working conditions. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=178.96s)]
*  NPR's Andrea Xu reporting. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=181.64s)]
*  Amazon says it doesn't expect delivery delays. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=183.76s)]
*  Amazon is among NPR's financial supporters. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=186.96s)]
*  Workers at Starbucks stores across the country say [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=190.88s)]
*  they're planning to launch a five-day strike today. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=193.44s)]
*  They'll start the strike in cities such as Chicago, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=196.28s)]
*  Los Angeles and Seattle. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  The union that represents the workers says [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment it made [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=202.92s)]
*  to settle a new labor agreement this year. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  Starbucks says the union walked away from the bargaining table this week. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=208.27999999999997s)]
*  A U.S. diplomatic delegation is in Damascus [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=212.76s)]
*  to hold talks with Syria's new interim government. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=215.6s)]
*  It's the first official delegation of its kind [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=218.44s)]
*  since the U.S. closed its embassy in 2012. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=220.88s)]
*  And Piers Hadil Al-Shelchi has more from Damascus. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=224.27999999999997s)]
*  The U.S. State Department said that the diplomatic delegation [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  traveling to Damascus will push what it called transition principles [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  with Syria's interim leaders on how to build an inclusive government. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=234.0s)]
*  The militia which led opposition forces to topple the Assad regime [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=237.88s)]
*  is Heya Al-Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=241.48s)]
*  It is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  HTS is desperate to shed the title which severely restricts [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=247.2s)]
*  the amount of aid Syria would receive, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=250.56s)]
*  money that it needs to rebuild the country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  The delegation will also be looking for new information [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  on the whereabouts of missing American journalist Austin Tice. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=257.44s)]
*  Hadil Al-Shelchi, NPR News, Damascus. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=260.96s)]
*  Officials in Australia are telling social media companies [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=263.56s)]
*  to start planning for a new age verification law. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=266.16s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen reports Australia passed the world's first ban [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=269.56s)]
*  on social media for children under 16 years old. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=273.08s)]
*  Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram and other social media apps [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=276.4s)]
*  now have to confirm a user's age under Australia's new law [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=279.12s)]
*  to prevent children under 16 from logging on. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=282.72s)]
*  Violating companies can pay fines up to $50 million. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=285.12s)]
*  The country's e-safety commissioner Julie Inman Grant [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  told NPR in an interview that social media should be treated [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=291.52s)]
*  in Australia like water safety. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  She says decades ago there was a spate of fatal drownings in swimming pools. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  So the country passed fencing requirements. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  But we don't try and fence the ocean because that's futile. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=303.64s)]
*  What we do is we teach our children to swim at the youngest age [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  just like we need to teach them digital literacy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  Grant says the aim of the law is to keep children away [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=315.24s)]
*  from the addictive design features of social media. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  Some apps like gaming and messaging platforms will be exempted. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=320.68s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=324.24s)]
*  The Food and Drug Administration has new rules [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  to determine which foods can be labeled as healthy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=328.12s)]
*  NPR's Alison Aubrey reports the changes come at a time [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  when diet-related diseases are a leading cause of disability and death in the U.S. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=334.6s)]
*  If a food manufacturer wants to add a healthy claim on their label, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=340.16s)]
*  the product must not contain too much saturated fat, added sugars or sodium. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=343.72s)]
*  In addition, the product must contain certain amounts [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=348.04s)]
*  of at least one of the food groups included in the dietary guidelines. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=350.36s)]
*  This includes beans, lean meats, fish, fruits and vegetables. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=354.16s)]
*  The FDA's Claudine Kavanagh says the new definition [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=358.0s)]
*  may help foster a healthy food supply. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=361.04s)]
*  The healthy claim can be a real quick signal to help empower consumers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=363.44s)]
*  The FDA says diet-related conditions such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=368.0s)]
*  contribute to America's status of having the lowest life expectancy [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=372.76s)]
*  among large, high-income countries. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=377.23999999999995s)]

*  Officials with the Los Angeles Zoo say they have helped hatch two baby parenti lizards. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=382.64s)]
*  These are among the largest types of lizards in the world [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  and can grow to more than eight feet long. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=390.44s)]
*  The LA Zoo officials say the hatchlings are the first to be bred there [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drUiGr_nngI&t=393.28s)]
