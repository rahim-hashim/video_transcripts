*  their caucus sites. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=10.36s)]
*  The race was called so early that there weren't even Trump supporters here yet at the Trump [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=11.36s)]
*  Watch Party to celebrate it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=15.3s)]
*  Later, Trump thanked his allies and voters in his victory speech, but also incorporated [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=16.96s)]
*  heavily from his stump speech. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=21.12s)]
*  Trump warned the crowd about undocumented immigrants, saying that there's a quote, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=23.44s)]
*  invasion at the southern border. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=26.68s)]
*  He also promoted the lie that he won the 2020 election. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=28.76s)]
*  Trump is headed next to New Hampshire, which holds its primary next Tuesday, January 23rd. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=32.22s)]
*  Trump will hold rallies in the state on both tonight and tomorrow night. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=37.44s)]
*  Danielle Kurtz-Lehbren, NPR News, Des Moines. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=40.88s)]
*  The former president vanquished his opponents to win the Iowa caucuses. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=43.08s)]
*  He got more than 50 percent of the vote. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis finished second, and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=49.88s)]

*  turn out for her. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=70.4s)]
*  If they do come out and vote, our polling is showing strongly that they're going to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=71.84s)]
*  support Haley. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=75.76s)]

*  If they come out strongly, and by that I mean getting up over 40 percent to 45 percent of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=84.16000000000001s)]

*  Iran launched the attack late Monday night near a new U.S. consulate complex. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=129.64s)]
*  But the target wasn't the U.S. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=134.48s)]
*  Instead, Iran said it was targeting what it called, without any proof, Israeli spy bases. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=136.32s)]
*  Kurdish media said at least five missiles targeted the home of a prominent Iraqi Kurdish [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7l76fuavU&t=141.64s)]
