**NPR - News Now:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc)
*  A federal judge has refused to block the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=0.0s)]
*  of Peace. And the Federal Reserve is holding interest rates steady as President Trump's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=5.12s)]
*  tariffs spark uncertainty in the U.S. economy. Good morning. I'm Cora Vick-Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=9.52s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. A federal judge is refusing to temporarily block the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace. The USIP is a congressionally [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  funded think tank. Its takeover has been led by DOJ. NPR's Ryan Lucas reports some former members [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=26.16s)]
*  of the Institute of Peace have sued, claiming they were unlawfully removed from their positions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=32.56s)]
*  The lawsuit seeks to reinstate the board members who were removed and to block DOJ from further [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=37.76s)]
*  accessing the Institute or its systems. At a hearing in federal court in Washington, D.C., [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=42.16s)]
*  U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said she was very offended by how DOJ has moved to take over USIP. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=47.44s)]
*  That includes threatening criminal prosecution and showing up with armed law enforcement to remove [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=53.36s)]
*  senior employees from the building. But Judge Howell says there is confusion in the lawsuit [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=58.16s)]
*  and that she has concerns about its likelihood of success on the merits. She therefore denied the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  former USIP board member's request for a temporary restraining order, blocking DOJ's actions while [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=68.4s)]
*  the lawsuit proceeds. Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. The Federal Reserve has left short-term [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=74.08s)]
*  interest rates unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell says there is uncertainty in the US economy. He [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=79.68s)]
*  says some of that is linked to President Trump's tariffs. Investors have been rattled because these [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=86.48s)]
*  have been on again and off again. NPR's Maria Aspin says some market instability happened last [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  week when President Trump did not rule out the chance of a recession because of tariffs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=97.84s)]
*  The argument Trump is making is that tariffs will be good for the US long term and that will be [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  worth any shorter term pain. But most people don't really want to experience any pain, even if it does [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=108.32s)]
*  turn out to be shorter term. So when Powell emphasized yesterday that the US economy is strong [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=114.96s)]
*  and prices aren't soaring up too much yet, at least for the day that was a pretty reassuring message. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=120.16s)]
*  NPR's Maria Aspin reporting. Colorado Democratic Senator Michael Bennett is casting doubt on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=126.0s)]
*  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's future in Democratic Party leadership. NPR's Barbara [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=131.92s)]
*  Sprunt reports Bennett stopped short of calling for Schumer to step down. Schumer has come under [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=137.52s)]
*  fire from House Democrats and within his own caucus for voting to advance GOP legislation that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=143.28s)]
*  prevented a shutdown of the federal government. Schumer had signaled that Republicans didn't have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=148.8s)]
*  the votes to advance their spending measure but later shifted course arguing the bill's passage [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=153.68s)]
*  was the lesser of two evils. At a town hall in Golden, Colorado, Senator Bennett was asked when [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=158.96s)]
*  he would call on Leader Schumer to leave his leadership position. And in dodging your question [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=164.56s)]
*  let me just say it's important for people to know you know when it's time to to go. Bennett said he [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=169.52s)]
*  didn't think the message was clear to the public what Democrats were fighting for and said there [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=177.28s)]
*  would be conversations in the foreseeable future about Democratic leadership. Barbara Sprunt and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=182.4s)]

*  its frozen meals made by stoffers and lean cuisine. The company says a few batches could be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=194.88s)]
*  contaminated by what it calls wood-like material. There's a report that one person had a potential [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=201.44s)]
*  choking incident. I'm Corva Coleman NPR News in Washington. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsB7ZyGkVc&t=208.4s)]
