# Heat Dome Bringing Dangerous Temperatures To Much Of California | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE)
*  Temperatures in parts of California could soon top 120 degrees, busting heat records. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=0.0s)]
*  And several tornadoes touched down in the Chicago area last night, including one near [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=6.4s)]
*  O'Hare Airport. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=10.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=11.56s)]
*  I'm Corea Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=12.56s)]
*  California is facing a dangerous heat wave. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=16.88s)]
*  Temperatures in some parts of the state could soon top 120 degrees. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=18.88s)]
*  From member station KVPR, Joshua Yeager reports that would bust century-old records. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=23.8s)]
*  Yeager says a heat dome is behind the sweltering weather set to bake much of the southwest. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=29.88s)]
*  That's air heated over the Pacific Ocean and trapped under high atmospheric pressure. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=35.12s)]
*  The high pressure kind of acts like a blanket. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=40.48s)]
*  Carlos Molina is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=42.8s)]
*  He says this blanket is going to cover much of inland California for days. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=46.8s)]
*  Several cities here are expected to break daily heat records above 110 degrees. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  Nearly all of the state will be under an excessive heat warning by Friday. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=57.76s)]
*  That means stay indoors if you can. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=62.04s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Joshua Yeager in Bakersfield. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=64.44s)]
*  The National Weather Service says several tornadoes hit Illinois yesterday, most of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=67.44s)]
*  them in the Chicago area. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=71.64s)]
*  One of the tornadoes touched down near O'Hare Airport, grounding flights. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=73.88s)]
*  Greg Tempe lives in a Chicago suburb, where a tornado tore down a 100-year-old tree on [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=78.08s)]
*  his property. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=83.4s)]
*  It really left as quick as it came. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  It was maybe 10, 20 seconds and it was out of here and all this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=87.76s)]
*  There are no reports of injuries. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  The Georgia State Election Board is suing the organization True the Vote. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=94.48s)]
*  Officials allege the group promotes election conspiracy theories and has refused to provide [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=99.4s)]
*  evidence for its claims. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  From member station WABE in Atlanta, Sam Greenglass has more. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=105.64000000000001s)]
*  In a movie titled 2000 Mules, True the Vote argued without evidence that unspecified liberal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=109.88s)]
*  groups conspired to stuff drop boxes in swing states with fraudulent ballots to steal the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=115.72s)]
*  2020 election from Donald Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=122.28s)]
*  Law enforcement has debunked those claims, but True the Vote filed a complaint with the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=124.88s)]
*  election board, accusing groups of paying $10 per absentee ballot submitted by Dropbox. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=129.24s)]
*  The board, which is dominated by Republican appointees, has issued subpoenas for documents [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=134.86s)]
*  or sources to prove the claims, but True the Vote has not produced any. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  The election board has already dismissed other cases highlighted by 2000 Mules. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=144.9s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sam Greenglass in Atlanta. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=149.98000000000002s)]

*  They'll also attend a key meeting with other leaders from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  Iceland. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=161.62s)]
*  President Biden has just come from the NATO summit in Lithuania. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=162.62s)]
*  The allies discussed beefing up their cooperation with Ukraine as it resists Russia's invasion. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say they have again shot down about 20 Russian drones aimed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=171.9s)]
*  at their capital, Kyiv, overnight, falling debris wounded at least two people and destroyed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwwb8mJ2SE&t=176.98000000000002s)]
