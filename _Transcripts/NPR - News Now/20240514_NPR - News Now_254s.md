# Blinken Makes An Unannounced Visit To Kyiv | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU)
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Kiev today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=0.0s)]
*  And jury selection resumes in the federal corruption trial of New Jersey Democratic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=4.7s)]
*  Senator Bob Menendez. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=9.36s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=11.22s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=12.22s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is making an unannounced trip to the Ukrainian capital [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=16.9s)]
*  today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=22.28s)]
*  This is the first visit of a senior Biden administration official to Ukraine following [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=23.28s)]
*  the long delayed passage of additional security aid to the country. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=28.32s)]
*  During a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kiev, Blinken said the fresh round of assistance [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=33.28s)]
*  will make a real difference in Ukraine's defense against Russia. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=38.92s)]
*  We know this is a challenging time, but we also know that in the near term the assistance [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=43.8s)]
*  is now on the way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  Some of it's already arrived. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=52.6s)]
*  More of it will be arriving. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=53.6s)]
*  And that's going to make a real difference against the ongoing Russian aggression on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=55.64s)]
*  the battlefield. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=59.32s)]
*  Russia continues to push into northeastern Ukraine after making several major advances [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=60.32s)]
*  in the region over the past week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=65.72s)]
*  Jury selection resumes today in the federal corruption trial of Senator Bob Menendez. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=68.74s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reports the New Jersey Democrat is facing 16 counts, including bribery and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=74.4s)]
*  obstruction of justice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=81.52s)]
*  Menendez has pleaded not guilty and is fighting the charges. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=83.32s)]
*  He is standing trial alongside two New Jersey businessmen who prosecutors say gave Menendez [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=85.96s)]
*  and his wife hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including gold bars, cash, and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=90.96s)]
*  a luxury car. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=95.63999999999999s)]
*  In exchange, Menendez allegedly used his position as a powerful U.S. Senator to help the businessmen [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  and to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=102.8s)]
*  Menendez's wife was also charged, but she's scheduled to face trial separately this summer. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  Jury selection resumes for a second day in Menendez's trial now, after no jurors were [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=111.32s)]
*  selected on day one. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=115.94s)]
*  The trial is expected to last a little less than two months. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=121.36s)]
*  Demolition crews in Baltimore, Maryland have removed the remaining span of the Francis [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=123.72s)]
*  Scott Key Bridge. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=129.32s)]
*  Mamboi Kamau, a member station, WYPR, reports the bridge collapsed in March after it was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  hit by a massive cargo ship. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=137.12s)]
*  A boom followed by billowing black smoke filled the air when engineers made precision cuts [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=141.48s)]
*  separating a 4,000-ton bridge section that sat on the cargo ship. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=147.92s)]
*  Captain of the Port David O'Connell calls the operation a success. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=153.0s)]
*  The section separated, so it went according to plan, fell away from the ship. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=157.44s)]
*  So it was a pretty awesome sight to see. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=162.0s)]
*  I've seen demolitions of a bridge, but I've never seen it on a vessel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Certainly a unique event. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=168.56s)]
*  Next, crews will clear and recover pieces of the bridge from the water and conduct a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=170.72s)]
*  dive survey assessment in the morning. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=175.56s)]
*  The dolly is expected to be relocated to berth within 48 hours. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=178.36s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Mamboi Kamau in Baltimore. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=182.76s)]
*  The CEO of YouTube says content creators should be considered for Emmy Awards. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=186.16s)]
*  NPR's Mandelid Del Barco reports he argues creators such as Mr. Beast and Michelle Kerr [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=192.88s)]
*  should be recognized for their online work. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=199.74s)]
*  In a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter, YouTube CEO Neil Mohan says online video creators [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=202.86s)]
*  are defining a new era of entertainment, what he calls the new Hollywood. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  For example, he pointed to Sean Evans' Hot Ones with 3 billion views, a talk show during [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=213.94s)]
*  which celebrities like Cardi B, Jennifer Lawrence, and Conan O'Brien munch on progressively [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  spicier chicken wings. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=224.82000000000002s)]
*  I just want to go home to my kid. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=226.62s)]
*  I get it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=229.38s)]
*  I get it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=230.38s)]
*  I feel like I'm going to die. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=231.38s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=234.06s)]
*  What's wrong with you people? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=235.06s)]
*  You don't know what real danger looks like anymore. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=237.06s)]
*  Mohan urged the Emmy Awards to reflect what viewers are actually watching on their screens [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=239.82s)]
*  or risk becoming out of step with huge young viewing audiences. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=244.58s)]
*  Mandelid Del Barco, NPR News. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSFkYl64KfU&t=248.66s)]
