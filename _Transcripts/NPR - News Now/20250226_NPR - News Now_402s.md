# Trump Introduces A Green Card For The Rich: The $5M Gold Card | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw)
*  House Republicans passed a framework for a federal budget last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Trump says he plans to introduce a new type of visa to attract rich foreigners to the U.S. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  A five million dollar gold card. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=9.8s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=12.4s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=15.0s)]
*  House Republicans passed a framework for a federal budget plan last night. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=16.6s)]
*  It was on a near party line vote. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=20.2s)]
*  It calls for four and a half trillion dollars in tax cuts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=22.2s)]
*  And it slashes two trillion dollars in federal spending over a decade. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=25.6s)]
*  But to succeed, the budget plan has to maneuver through a legislative process in both the House and Senate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  It's called reconciliation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=35.4s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson is optimistic. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=37.199999999999996s)]
*  This is the first important step in opening up the reconciliation process. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=39.8s)]
*  We have a lot of hard work ahead of us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=44.2s)]
*  But we are going to deliver the American First Agenda. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=46.0s)]
*  We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  And this is the first step in that process. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=50.8s)]
*  Democrats and some moderate Republicans fear that in order to pay for the immense tax cuts, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  the GOP will slice Medicare, Medicaid and other safety net programs long targeted by some conservative Republicans. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=58.2s)]
*  President Trump says he is introducing a new visa program to attract rich foreigners to the U.S. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=65.8s)]
*  We're going to be selling a gold card. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=71.60000000000001s)]
*  You have a green card. This is a gold card. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=77.0s)]
*  We're going to be putting a price on that card of about five million dollars. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  And that's going to give you green card privileges. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=83.2s)]
*  It's going to be a route to citizenship. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=86.2s)]
*  New Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says the gold card will replace the current EB-5 immigrant investor visa. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  That program gives residency to foreigners who invest at least eight hundred thousand dollars in creating businesses in the U.S. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=96.4s)]
*  That effort is supposed to create jobs in rural and economically underserved areas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=104.2s)]
*  A federal judge in Seattle has blocked President Trump's effort to suspend the U.S. refugee program. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=109.0s)]
*  As NPR's Sergio Martinez Beltran reports, Trump indefinitely paused the refugee admissions on his first day in office. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=114.8s)]
*  In his ruling U.S. District Judge Demar Whitehead said Trump has discretion to suspend refugee admissions, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  but quote, that authority is not limitless. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=128.4s)]
*  The lawsuit was filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of major aid groups who say their ability to provide services to refugees [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=131.6s)]
*  was hampered by the suspension of the U.S. admissions program. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=139.2s)]
*  The Trump administration had said the suspension would last until the entry of refugees aligns with the interests of the country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=143.0s)]
*  The shutdown left thousands of refugees stranded around the world, despite many having scheduled travel to the U.S. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=149.6s)]
*  Pending unexpected appeal, admissions and funding for refugee groups must resume. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=155.6s)]
*  Sergio Martinez Beltran, NPR News. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=160.6s)]
*  The White House says it will now choose which media outlets get close access to cover President Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=163.4s)]
*  White House press officials say they alone will determine who covers the president at major events where space is limited. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=169.6s)]
*  Until now, that has been the jurisdiction of the White House Correspondence Association made up of news outlets. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=175.8s)]
*  The head of the Correspondence Association is criticizing the move. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=182.0s)]
*  Eugene Daniels says that in free countries, leaders don't get to pick who covers them day in and day out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=185.4s)]
*  Thousands of federal workers are losing their jobs as part of the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the government. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=192.0s)]
*  The cuts range from public health to consumer protection and more. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=198.6s)]
*  Now the Department of Veterans Affairs has cut an additional 1,400 jobs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Quill Lawrence reports veterans groups have condemned the cuts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=207.6s)]
*  Job cuts at the VA now total around 2,500, which the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, called indiscriminate firings. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=211.4s)]
*  Nearly a third of VA staffers are veterans themselves, and several of those let go say they received excellent reviews before a sudden termination for poor performance. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=219.1s)]
*  Veterans fired from the VA suicide crisis hotline told NPR they were let go and suddenly rehired days later. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=228.4s)]
*  Senators on the Veterans Affairs Committee from both parties say they have asked, but not received, explanations from VA about the cuts. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  In a statement, VA said none of the jobs cut are mission critical and that VA continues to hire for more than 300,000 critical posts that are exempt from the federal hiring freeze. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=242.8s)]
*  Quill Lawrence, NPR News. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=252.4s)]
*  U.S. tariffs on imported aluminum and steel are poised to take effect as early as next month. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=254.0s)]
*  Now President Trump has signed a new executive order, and Piers Asmohallad reports it opens an investigation that could lead to tariffs on another imported metal, copper. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=259.8s)]
*  The Trump administration is launching an investigation into whether imports of copper pose a risk to American national security. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=269.6s)]
*  It's using the same legal justification it's used for steel and aluminum tariffs. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=276.8s)]
*  The White House did not specify how quickly the investigation would happen or what the potential tariff rate might be. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=281.6s)]
*  Copper is key for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  A White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement told reporters that China has been flooding world markets with subsidized copper. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  But the top copper producers in the world are actually Chile and Peru. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  Asmohallad, NPR News, The White House. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=307.0s)]
*  In Israel, crowds have gathered along roads throughout the country to observe the funeral procession for a mother and her two sons. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=310.2s)]
*  They were killed while being held hostage in Gaza. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=318.2s)]
*  Hamas returned their bodies last week. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=321.0s)]
*  NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from outside a funeral home in central Israel. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=323.8s)]
*  An entire nation in Israel had been hoping that Shiri Bebas and her young sons, Ariel and Kfir, four and nine months old, would be returned alive from Gaza. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=328.6s)]
*  And instead today, Israelis are paying their final respects as their bodies are brought for burial. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=339.6s)]
*  It's quarter to eight in the morning and hundreds of Israelis are standing absolutely silently in the streets. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=345.6s)]
*  And sometimes they break out in quiet songs singing the Israeli national anthem. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=352.6s)]
*  They're waiting outside the funeral home as the funeral procession begins here, all the way down to southern Israel, near the border with Gaza, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=360.6s)]
*  where they're being laid to rest. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=367.6s)]
*  NPR's Daniel Estrin reporting. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=369.6s)]
*  A Chinese designer posted a vacation photo online a couple of weeks ago and it's been a sensation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=371.6s)]
*  Guo Qingshan's picture is of a mountain in central China next to the Yangtze River. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=378.6s)]
*  It looks like a dog's head resting on a riverbank. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=383.6s)]
*  Guo calls this Puppy Mountain. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=387.6s)]
*  The photo's got millions of online views. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=389.6s)]
*  And now, the Chinese people are taking pictures of their own dogs to see which looks most like the mountain. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPmGFpqb7cw&t=392.6s)]
