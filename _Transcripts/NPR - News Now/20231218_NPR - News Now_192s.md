# Outrage In Israel After Military Forces Kill 3 Hostages | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ)
*  The U.S. continues to press Israeli officials to do more to limit civilian casualties in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And North Korea has carried out back-to-back launches of short and long-range missiles. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=5.84s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=10.88s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is in Israel for meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  and others. Austin is expected to again press Israel to limit civilian casualties as it attacks [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=19.84s)]
*  This comes as the Israeli government is facing harsh criticism from its citizens. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=26.16s)]
*  And Piers Katlonsdorf says last week the Israeli military mistakenly shot and killed three Israeli [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  hostages. They were killed on Friday in an active combat area in northern Gaza. The men were dressed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=35.92s)]
*  in civilian clothes and waving a white cloth walking toward Israeli soldiers when they were [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=41.36s)]
*  shot according to a preliminary report by the Israeli military. A military spokesman said that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=45.92s)]
*  the shootings were against the army's rules of engagement and were being investigated at the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  highest level. But people here are upset. There have been protests here in Tel Aviv this weekend [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=54.96s)]
*  with people increasingly calling for and demanding for a new hostage deal or even a permanent cease [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  fire. NPR's Katlonsdorf reporting. North Korea has carried out back-to-back launches of short [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=66.0s)]
*  and long-range missiles. NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul. South Korea detected preparations for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=71.68s)]
*  a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Both the short-range and suspected [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=77.52s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles were fired eastward into the sea about 10 hours apart. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=82.64s)]
*  If confirmed, it would set a record of five North Korean ICBM launches in a year. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=87.84s)]
*  Last week, a U.S. and South Korean nuclear consultative group met in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=93.12s)]
*  to hammer out a joint nuclear defense strategy. The group discussed sending more U.S. military [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=97.92s)]
*  hardware to Asia to deter North Korea. That includes the nuclear-powered USS Missouri submarine, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=102.8s)]
*  which docked at the port of Busan on Sunday. North Korea slammed the deployment, accusing the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=109.12s)]
*  U.S. of escalating tensions and preparing for a nuclear war with the North. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Seoul. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  A powerful storm has barreled up the East Coast and is pummeling mid-Atlantic states and New England. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=121.44s)]
*  Some areas of South Carolina got 16 inches of rain. People are leaving some neighborhoods and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=126.48s)]
*  otherwise growing cities, according to a new study. NPR's Rebecca Herscher reports some areas [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  that can get flooded are seeing the number of residents drop. The study analyzed block-by-block [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=138.16s)]
*  census data and compared it to flood exposure information. The authors from multiple universities [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=143.76s)]
*  and science nonprofit groups found that about 7 percent of census blocks are declining in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=150.0s)]
*  population due to flood risk. And those hot spots are often located in cities that are growing in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=155.76s)]
*  population overall, such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Houston, and San Antonio. The study was published [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=161.6s)]
*  in the journal Nature Communications. The findings underscore how flooding can have uneven effects. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=167.84s)]
*  It also reinforces a growing body of research that suggests Americans are increasingly aware [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=173.76s)]
*  that climate change is driving more flooding and that home buyers may be factoring that into [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=179.04s)]
*  decisions about where to live. Rebecca Herscher, NPR News. You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpQgZY3hwnQ&t=184.16s)]
