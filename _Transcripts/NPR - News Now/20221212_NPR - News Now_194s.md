*  A man suspected of making the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=0.0s)]
*  in 1988 is now in U.S. custody. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  And Twitter is expected to relaunch its paid checkmark program today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=12.76s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=13.76s)]
*  The Libyan man suspected of making the bomb that took down an American passenger plane [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=17.92s)]
*  over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 is now in U.S. custody. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=21.82s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas has more on an arrest that was 34 years in the making. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=26.4s)]
*  The Justice Department says Abu Aghaeel Muhammad Masoud Kira al-Marimi made the bomb that detonated [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=31.0s)]
*  on Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=35.86s)]
*  Two hundred and seventy people were killed, including 190 Americans. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=40.16s)]
*  Two Libyan operatives were initially charged and tried in a special court. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  One was convicted, the other acquitted. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=48.26s)]
*  Years later, federal investigators had a breakthrough after Masoud allegedly confessed to the Lockerbie [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  bombing in an interview with Libyan authorities. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=54.88s)]
*  That led the Justice Department to charge Masoud in 2020. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=58.0s)]
*  On Sunday, the Libyans handed Masoud over to an FBI team, which flew him back to the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=61.36s)]
*  U.S. to face trial in federal court in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  Opening statements get underway today in the second trial of Oath Keepers members accused [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=71.56s)]
*  of the rarely used charge of seditious conspiracy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=76.2s)]
*  They're charged with plotting to use force to block the transfer of power to President [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=79.88s)]
*  Biden. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=83.84s)]
*  Four members of the group are on trial, charged with helping Oath Keepers founder Stuart Rhodes [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=84.84s)]
*  to carry out the plot. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  He and another member were convicted about two weeks ago of the same charge. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=91.28s)]
*  Tweet launching a program to sell verified check marks on its platform. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=96.04s)]
*  NPR's Bobby Allen says the first attempt by the social media platform's new owner, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=99.92s)]
*  Elon Musk, led to a flood of impersonators and scammers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=104.48s)]
*  This time, Twitter says a few things will be different. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=108.56s)]
*  First, before someone will receive a check mark, there will actually be a verification [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=110.84s)]
*  process, unlike last time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  And there are new colors. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=117.0s)]
*  Gray checks for governments, gold checks for companies, and blue for individuals. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=118.56s)]
*  But with less than half of its staff remaining, experts are concerned the company will not [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=123.08s)]
*  have the resources to properly authenticate accounts. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Another worry is that trolls, bullies, and spreaders of misinformation will now have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=130.24s)]
*  a larger megaphone in exchange for being paid subscribers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=134.36s)]
*  Twitter, which does not have a communications department, did not respond to a request for [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  comment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=142.16000000000003s)]

*  Former U.S. Congresswoman, Democrat Karen Bass, has taken the oath of office. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=146.8s)]
*  It was administered yesterday by Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=151.56s)]
*  In her speech, Bass says there are many Los Angeles priorities that all deserve focused, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=155.24s)]
*  immediate attention. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=160.36s)]
*  A pandemic, a rapidly changing economy, a rapidly changing climate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=162.08s)]
*  The cost of living. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=167.16s)]
*  And in Los Angeles, 40,000 people sleeping on the street every day. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Bass says that today, she plans to declare a state of emergency to deal with homelessness [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkV8C1CsdPg&t=174.44s)]
