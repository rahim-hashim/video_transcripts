# Mourners Attend Vigil For Madison School Shooting Victims | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM)
*  Lawmakers have until Friday to prevent a partial federal government shutdown, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=0.0s)]
*  and mourners attended a prayer service in Madison, Wisconsin last night [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=4.4s)]
*  for the victims of Monday's school shooting. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=8.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=10.4s)]
*  Congressional leaders have released details of their bipartisan stopgap spending plan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=14.9s)]
*  They need to pass the measure quickly, or the federal government will partially shut down late Friday night. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  It's worth about $100 billion, and there is a lot of money set aside [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=24.7s)]
*  to help pay for disaster recovery such as hurricanes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=29.2s)]
*  It's expected to pass, but NPR's Claudia Grisales says the Conservative Freedom Caucus [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=32.4s)]
*  is objecting to the cost of the legislation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=37.5s)]
*  Other conservative Republicans, however, in both chambers called it garbage, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=40.3s)]
*  quote, reckless spending. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=45.1s)]
*  So there's enough jam-packed in this bill that's causing its share of controversy for some along the way, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=46.8s)]
*  but many are still betting this bipartisan plan will still survive its critics. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=53.1s)]
*  NPR's Claudia Grisales reporting, the spending only runs through mid-March. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=57.1s)]
*  The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates today by as much as a quarter of a percentage point, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=61.9s)]
*  but inflation is a factor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=67.2s)]
*  Higher interest rates can help slow down consumer prices, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=68.7s)]
*  but NPR's Scott Horsley says higher rates can also be a drag on the economy. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=72.0s)]
*  So the Fed is trying to strike a balance here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=76.6s)]
*  Markets are betting the Fed is going to lower interest rates today, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=78.9s)]
*  and then after that maybe take a break and see how things play out. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=82.5s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reporting. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=86.5s)]
*  A Manhattan grand jury has indicted the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO Brian Thompson [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=88.30000000000001s)]
*  earlier this month. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=94.2s)]
*  Luigi Mangione faces several charges, including first and second degree murder. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=95.4s)]
*  From member station WNYC, Samantha Max says there's another accusation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=100.4s)]
*  Some of these murder charges allege that the killing was committed in furtherance of terrorism. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=105.9s)]
*  A Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, called the shooting, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=111.5s)]
*  brazen and said it was meant to cause shock and intimidation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=114.0s)]
*  Samantha Max reporting. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=117.9s)]
*  Mangione is still being held in central Pennsylvania. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  New York officials are trying to extradite him. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=122.5s)]
*  Mourners attended a prayer service last night near the Madison, Wisconsin religious school [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  where a student killed two other people and herself. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  Wisconsin Public Radio's Anya Van Wagtendonk has more. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=133.6s)]
*  Mourners walked through the dark towards a city church located next door to Abundant Life Christian School. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=137.4s)]
*  Just one day earlier, a student at that school shot and killed a fellow student and a teacher. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=143.5s)]
*  Inside the church, performers and speakers offered music and prayer. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=149.0s)]
*  Lisa Haney teaches middle school at Abundant Life. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=152.8s)]
*  She asked for faith and understanding. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  God, I don't know how to still inquire my own soul [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  because it's going crazy right now on the inside of me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=163.5s)]
*  The shooter was a 15-year-old girl who also died. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=166.8s)]
*  Madison police say they're still investigating her motives. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=170.10000000000002s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Anya Van Wagtendonk in Madison. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=173.5s)]
*  Russian authorities say they've detained a suspect in the killing of a Russian general [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=176.8s)]
*  who led the country's nuclear and chemical warfare division. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=181.0s)]
*  NPR's Ryland Barton reports Russian investigators claim the suspect was recruited by Ukrainian special forces. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=184.5s)]
*  General Igor Kirilov and his assistant were killed Tuesday when a bomb detonated inside a scooter. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=191.5s)]
*  According to a statement from Russia's security service, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=196.7s)]
*  the suspect is an Uzbek citizen who had been promised $100,000 [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=199.2s)]
*  and permission to move to Europe in exchange for carrying out the attack. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=203.2s)]
*  He allegedly set up a camera that live streamed the scene to Ukrainian handlers before detonating the bomb. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Russian officials say he faces up to life in prison. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=212.6s)]
*  The attack took place a day after Ukraine's security service charged General Kirilov [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=215.6s)]
*  with directing the use of banned chemical weapons. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=220.0s)]
*  Ukrainian officials claimed responsibility for the attack. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Ryland Barton, NPR News. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=226.0s)]
*  Despite efforts to address climate change, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=227.6s)]
*  new research shows global demand for coal reached a record high this year. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=230.0s)]
*  NPR's Jeff Brady reports much of the increase is in fast-growing Asian nations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=234.4s)]
*  U.S. coal production has declined for more than a decade, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=240.0s)]
*  but carbon dioxide from burning coal in the past is responsible for much of the climate pollution in the atmosphere now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=243.0s)]
*  Keske Satomori with the International Energy Agency says now, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=249.4s)]
*  developing countries are the ones increasing coal production and consumption. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=253.7s)]
*  The shift of coal to Asia continues. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=257.9s)]
*  So China, India, and ASEAN countries account for over three quarters of the global coal demand. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=261.1s)]
*  He says that demand likely will level off and decline in coming years. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=270.1s)]
*  That's because countries like China are also building a lot of renewable energy, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=273.5s)]
*  wind and solar, as well as nuclear energy plants, which are considered climate friendly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=278.1s)]
*  Jeff Brady, NPR News. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  The Venerable Children's Program, Sesame Street, is again looking for a new home [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=284.8s)]
*  after splitting from Max, formerly known as HBO. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=289.0s)]
*  The program was previously with PBS. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=292.5s)]
*  NPR's Elizabeth Blair reports Max will discontinue streaming new episodes of Sesame Street after next season. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  In a statement, Max says that new episodes of Sesame Street are no longer core to its strategy, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=302.6s)]
*  but it will rerun old episodes through 2027. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=309.1s)]
*  A lot of Sesame Street's educational content is evergreen, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=312.6s)]
*  but it's also known for talking about current issues in ways kids can understand [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=321.1s)]
*  and reaching underserved audiences. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=325.6s)]
*  Polly Conway is senior editor for TV and streaming at Common Sense Media. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=328.1s)]
*  Finding a new home is going to be integral to them creating new content [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=333.1s)]
*  and really reaching the audiences that need to be reached. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=337.6s)]
*  In a statement, Sesame Workshop says it plans to announce new distribution plans in the coming months. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=341.6s)]
*  Elizabeth Blair, NPR News. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=347.1s)]
*  This week's Billboard rankings are out. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=349.6s)]
*  NPR's Stephen Thompson reports holiday favorites are dominating. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=352.1s)]
*  It's beginning to look a lot like last year's Billboard charts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=356.1s)]
*  If you compare this week's Hot 100 to the same chart from 12 months ago, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=360.1s)]
*  you'll find that the top five is identical. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=364.6s)]
*  Mariah Carey's at number one, where she's been for 16 non-consecutive weeks in six consecutive years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=368.1s)]
*  Then you've got Brenda Lee, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=377.1s)]
*  Bobby Helms, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=382.1s)]
*  Wham! [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=386.1s)]
*  and Burl Ives. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=389.1s)]
*  In that exact order just like last year. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=393.1s)]
*  What's really hard to find on the holiday charts is new music. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=396.6s)]
*  The highest charting holiday song from this year is Christmas Magic by Leve at number 79. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=401.6s)]
*  Stephen Thompson, NPR News. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=409.6s)]
*  And I'm Korva Coleman, NPR News from Washington. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NkBKQHgNwM&t=411.6s)]
