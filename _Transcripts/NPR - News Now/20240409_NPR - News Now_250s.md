*  when her boyfriend Eric Hill got down on one knee and pulled out another kind of gemstone ring. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhjFAndmY8Y&t=209.0s)]

*  Others who want to propose in a similar way will either have to wait 20 years or travel overseas [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhjFAndmY8Y&t=230.0s)]
