*  It's a new record. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=6.0s)]
*  And Russia says a large fire has broken out at a military training ground in occupied Crimea. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=12.5s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=13.5s)]
*  Dangerous heat is back again today in the south and southwest. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=17.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service says about 80 million people are under some kind of heat caution. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=20.5s)]
*  Phoenix has broken a record. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=25.0s)]
*  It's been more than 110 degrees there for the last 19 days in a row. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=27.0s)]
*  Phoenix Fire Captain Kimberly Quick-Ragsdale says firefighters have responded to people in distress. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=31.5s)]
*  We're seeing consecutive days with temperatures above 110 and all across the valley our citizens are having a difficult time with these temperatures. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=37.5s)]

*  They're seeking clarification on a medical emergency exception to the law. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=57.5s)]

*  The plaintiffs want the court to create a binding interpretation of the exception that allows physicians to exercise their good faith judgment. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=85.0s)]
*  During this week's hearing, they're asking the court to block the state's abortion ban as it applies to pregnancy complications for the duration of the case. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgkLYH_8iDE&t=93.0s)]
