*  President Biden's late-stage prostate cancer diagnosis has revived debate about the recommendations [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=338.02s)]
*  around screening. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  Prostate cancer is very common, but also tends to be slow-growing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=347.18s)]
*  There's a blood test called the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA test, but it is prone to false [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=351.74s)]

*  Task Force, has seesawed, especially for men aged 55 to 69. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=371.3s)]
*  It gives its own recommendation of testing at that age group a tepid grade of C. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  For those over age 70, like the former president, screening is no longer recommended because [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=384.06s)]
*  the benefits would not outweigh the downsides of treatment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=390.3s)]
*  Yuki Noguchi, NPR News. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCBcjW5jX4&t=394.66s)]
