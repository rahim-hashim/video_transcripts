# Biden OKs Ukraine Using Long-Range Missiles In Russia | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc)
*  President Biden will permit Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia with U.S.-made long-range missiles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=0.0s)]
*  And an E. coli outbreak in the U.S. that's been linked to organic carrots has killed one person and sickened dozens more. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=13.0s)]
*  For the first time, President Biden is allowing Ukraine to fire U.S.-made long-range missiles into Russia. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=17.0s)]
*  A U.S. official tells NPR the change in policy was spurred by the deployment of North Korean troops [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=22.0s)]
*  who were sent to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. NPR's Tom Bowman has more. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=28.0s)]
*  The missiles are called Atacams and have a range of some 190 miles. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=33.0s)]
*  Ukrainian officials and their supporters in the U.S. have long pushed for their use. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=37.0s)]
*  But the Biden administration refused, fearing Russian escalation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=42.0s)]
*  Now, with thousands of North Korean troops fighting Ukrainian forces, who have seized portions of the Kursk region of Russia, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=46.0s)]
*  the administration has allowed the Atacams to strike targets there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=53.0s)]
*  The policy change could lead other countries, especially Britain, to allow their long-range missiles to be used as well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=57.0s)]
*  Tom Bowman, NPR News. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=65.0s)]
*  Brazil is hosting the summit of the Group of 20 Nations in Rio de Janeiro. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=67.0s)]
*  President Biden is there. Before he arrived in Rio, Biden visited the Amazon Rainforest, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=71.0s)]
*  the first sitting U.S. president to do so. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=76.0s)]
*  The G20 summit is focused on global governance, poverty and climate change. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=78.0s)]
*  UN Secretary-General António Guterres says nations that are more wealthy must step up to help developing countries fight climate change. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=83.0s)]
*  I will appeal to the sense of responsibility of all G20 countries. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=92.0s)]
*  Now is the time for leadership, by example, from the world's largest economies and emitters. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=96.0s)]
*  Failure is not an option. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=103.0s)]
*  The summit comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=105.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, Trump named his choice for the next U.S. Energy Secretary. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=109.0s)]
*  It is Chris Wright, the head of an oil and gas company. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=113.0s)]
*  Wright has publicly said there is no global climate crisis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=116.0s)]
*  He has also claimed there is no increase in the intensity of weather disasters. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=120.0s)]
*  That is not what climate scientists say, who point to evidence human activity is causing global warming. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=124.0s)]
*  Nearly 40 people have become ill, and one person has died following an E. coli outbreak linked to organic carrots. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=131.0s)]
*  Several brands of carrots have since been recalled, including some sold at Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and Walmart. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=138.0s)]
*  And Pierce Juliana Kim reports. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=144.0s)]
*  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday it's investigating a multi-state E. coli outbreak tied to organic carrots. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=146.0s)]
*  The cases have emerged in more than a dozen states, with the highest numbers reported in Washington, Minnesota and New York. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=155.0s)]
*  But the CDC warns that the outbreak may have reached additional states, and the actual number of infections is likely much higher. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=164.0s)]
*  Investigations indicate that Grimway Farms was the common supplier of the organic carrots consumed by individuals before they got sick. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=172.0s)]
*  On Saturday, the company initiated a recall for some of its carrots that were sold at major retailers, including Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and Walmart. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=181.0s)]
*  Juliana Kim, NPR News. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=190.0s)]
*  NPR. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLnYr6K6lBc&t=193.0s)]
