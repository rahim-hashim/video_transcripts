# Republicans Soften Stance On Abortion In 2024 Platform | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow)
*  The White House physician says President Biden hasn't seen a neurologist outside his annual [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=0.0s)]
*  physicals and the Republican Party is softening its stance on abortion in its new party platform. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=4.92s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=11.36s)]
*  As President Biden continues to resist pressure from Democrats to end his reelection bid, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=16.18s)]
*  Biden's doctor is responding to questions about a neurologist having visited the White [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=21.2s)]
*  House multiple times in less than a year. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=25.8s)]
*  NPR's Aswah Khalid has more. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=28.92s)]
*  Biden has dismissed his poor debate as a bad night. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=31.12s)]
*  But after a New York Times report that a neurologist visited the White House eight times in eight [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=34.32s)]
*  months, the White House faced fresh questions. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=39.0s)]
*  And late Monday, the president's physician released a letter saying that Biden had seen [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=42.32s)]
*  this neurologist only during his annual physical. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=46.72s)]
*  Biden's doctor suggested the other visits the neurologist made to the White House were [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  related to treating other patients who work at the White House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=54.52s)]
*  And he reiterated that in February, Biden was given a detailed neurological exam and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=58.24s)]
*  there were no findings of Parkinson's or other neurological disorders. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=63.84s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=68.68s)]
*  The Republican Party published its platform, the principles it will run on for the fall's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=71.4s)]
*  campaign, adopting former President Trump's objectives, softening the party's positions [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=76.12s)]
*  on abortion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=81.12s)]
*  And here Stephen Fowler has more. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=82.12s)]
*  After 35 mentions of the word abortion in 2016's platform, the current platform only [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=84.06s)]
*  has one. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Because of Trump, the official stance now is that states can decide what level of restrictions [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=89.8s)]
*  to enact. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=94.22s)]
*  I mean, Republicans have been consistently on the losing side of this issue at the ballot [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=95.22s)]
*  box ever since that Dobs Supreme Court decision. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=98.8s)]
*  While Republicans do not commit here to a national abortion ban, this platform is not [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=101.98s)]
*  binding in any way. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=106.4s)]
*  And it doesn't change the views of many of his allies and advocacy groups who still want [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=107.66s)]
*  that type of restriction and will likely still push for it if Trump wins. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=111.98s)]
*  NPR Stephen Fowler reporting. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=116.36s)]
*  Forecasters say that big storm that slammed into Texas yesterday is weakening. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=119.2s)]
*  Barrel is now a tropical depression and forecasters say the storm should diminish more today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder has more. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=128.76s)]
*  Barrel came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, bringing howling winds and torrential rain [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=130.72s)]
*  that brought down trees and flooded streets in the Houston area. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=135.44s)]
*  According to the tracking website, PowerOutage.us, Barrel cut electricity to more than 2.7 million [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=139.4s)]
*  homes and businesses in Texas. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=145.78s)]
*  While the vast majority were in Texas, there were plenty of outages in Louisiana as well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=148.14000000000001s)]
*  And while the lights have begun to come back on, officials say it may take several days [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=152.82s)]
*  to fully restore power. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=156.5s)]
*  Barrel is blamed for killing several people in Texas and Louisiana. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=158.66s)]
*  And while the storm is weakening as it moves over land, it remains dangerous. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=162.16s)]
*  Dozens of tornado warnings were issued overnight in Louisiana and Arkansas. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjrMi9dhoow&t=166.82s)]
