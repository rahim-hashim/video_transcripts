# Trump: Israel, Iran 'Don't Know What the F*** They're Doing' | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw)
*  President Trump lashed out at both Israel and Iran this morning after they appeared to violate a ceasefire reached overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=0.0s)]
*  And the U.S. Supreme Court says the Trump administration can continue to deport migrants to countries that are not their homes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=13.4s)]
*  Israel and Iran have both said they're observing a ceasefire. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=18.0s)]
*  But Israel says Iran broke it earlier, something Iran denies. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=21.5s)]
*  Israel says it carried out a limited strike near Iran's capital. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  President Trump lashed out at both Israel and Iran, saying he was not happy with either one of them. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, the president insists the ceasefire is in place, but it is fragile. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=34.8s)]
*  Expressing frustration with apparent violations of the ceasefire, President Trump used an expletive. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=41.1s)]
*  U.S. presidents simply do not say on camera, quote, they don't know what the blank they're doing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=46.7s)]
*  I think they both violated it. I don't think they, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=53.8s)]
*  They couldn't rein people back. I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=58.3s)]
*  And I'm going to see if I can stop it. A short time later from Air Force One, he posted on Truth Social, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=63.3s)]
*  Israel would not attack Iran and all planes would turn around and head home. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  Further writing, nobody will be hurt. The ceasefire is in effect. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=73.5s)]
*  Tamara Keith NPR News. Iran fired several missiles yesterday at a U.S. military base in Qatar. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=77.8s)]
*  It was in response to the U.S. strikes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  Another way that Iran could retaliate against the U.S. is to close the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=86.2s)]
*  NPR's Kat Lonsdorf explains the narrow waterway is a vital pathway for world energy supplies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=91.8s)]
*  Around 20 percent of the world's oil and natural gas goes through the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=97.8s)]
*  A full closure, which has never happened before, would have a major impact on energy markets around the world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=102.1s)]
*  Iran's parliament has voted to close the strait according to Iranian state TV. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=108.0s)]
*  The move would still require approval from Iran's top security council. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=112.0s)]
*  But closing it would also hurt Iran's economy since its oil also passes through. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  Energy experts tell NPR a more likely scenario would be Iran carrying out covert actions in the strait [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  against certain ships without completely halting trade. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=126.7s)]
*  The price of crude oil has fluctuated in recent days and insurance for ships making the journey has gone up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=130.20000000000002s)]

*  NATO allies are set to pass an ambitious defense investment plan that will see them stepping up defense spending [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=150.0s)]
*  to five percent of GDP, a big rise from the current two percent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=155.9s)]
*  The alliance's secretary general, Mark Ruta, says the war raging in Ukraine is the greatest threat to Europe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=160.3s)]
*  and those protected by the NATO umbrella. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  He says NATO could devastate Russia if it attacked a member today, but things could be different in the future. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=168.7s)]
*  Between three, five, seven years from now, Russia will be able to successfully attack us [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=174.5s)]
*  if we do not start investing more today. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=179.5s)]
*  Europe, says Ruta, has no choice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=181.89999999999998s)]

*  The court's ruling overturns a lower court's decision. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=194.1s)]
*  NPR's Tovia Smith reports there have been objections. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=197.2s)]
*  The court did not explain its reasoning, but dissenting justices did, calling the order inexcusable. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  Attorney Anwen Hughes, who represented immigrants being sent to South Sudan, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=206.2s)]
*  says thousands others may now have no chance to challenge deportations to countries where they risk torture, for example. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=210.7s)]
*  This administration, you know, don't really show mature judgment or concern for human life. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=217.7s)]
*  And so we're extremely concerned that this pattern can have devastating consequences. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=223.7s)]

*  The nation's top safety investigators meet today to consider what caused a door plug panel to blow out of a Boeing 737 MAX jet [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=245.1s)]

*  The National Transportation Safety Board will hear the final results of an investigation into what caused the midair blowout in January of 2024. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=261.5s)]
*  The NTSB has previously said that four bolts that were supposed to hold the door plug panel in place were missing when the Boeing 737 MAX jet was delivered to Alaska Airlines the previous year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMBnGxSsLw&t=269.7s)]
