# Maui's Death Toll Rises To 111 | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0)
*  On Maui, the death toll has risen to at least 111, and Texas is suing Planned Parenthood [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=0.0s)]
*  for millions of dollars in Medicaid payments. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=7.72s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=10.52s)]
*  The death toll from the Maui fires has risen to at least 111, with the number expected [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=15.5s)]
*  to grow in the coming days. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=21.14s)]
*  As the island undertakes the long road to recovery, leaders say it's important to also [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=23.12s)]
*  make sure the economy stays healthy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=28.1s)]
*  And as NPR's Jason DeRose reports, that means keeping tourist numbers up. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=30.82s)]
*  When the fires broke out last week, state and island officials immediately urged tourists [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=35.78s)]
*  not to come. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=40.42s)]
*  But it's since become clear that most of the damage, although severe, is contained to the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=41.74s)]
*  western part of Maui. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=46.22s)]
*  More than half the island's residents have jobs in some way related to the tourism industry. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=48.38s)]
*  Christian Gallupon's aunt works as a housekeeper at a Maui resort. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=53.82s)]
*  She lost her home in the blaze. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=57.9s)]
*  You know, people were asking her, like, well, you just lost everything. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=59.62s)]
*  Why'd you clock into work? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=63.18s)]
*  And she was like, I still need to make money. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=64.54s)]
*  Last year, close to three million tourists visited the island and spent nearly $5.7 billion. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=68.38s)]
*  Jason DeRose, NPR News, Maui. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=75.06s)]
*  Planned Parenthood is awaiting a ruling in a major lawsuit. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=78.22s)]
*  Texas Tech public media's Sarah Self-Walrack reports that the state of Texas is suing Planned [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=82.1s)]
*  Parenthood for millions of dollars in Medicaid payments. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=88.22s)]
*  Texas tried to block Planned Parenthood from getting Medicaid funds in 2015. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=91.1s)]
*  That didn't happen until 2021. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=96.58s)]
*  Now, Planned Parenthood estimates it could have to pay more than a billion dollars. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=99.22s)]
*  It could lead to more clinic closures in Texas. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=105.34s)]
*  Susan Manning is general counsel for Planned Parenthood. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=108.82s)]
*  Many of the health center patients are women, people with low incomes and people from other [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=112.69999999999999s)]
*  communities who have historically faced barriers to care. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=117.1s)]
*  Conservative Judge Matthew Kasmerich, who has made several high profile rulings in abortion [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=120.94s)]
*  related cases, has not said when he will decide in this case. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=126.46s)]
*  I'm Sarah Self-Walbrick in Lubbock. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=131.7s)]
*  In California, retailers are struggling as several flash mobs rush into luxury stores [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=135.18s)]
*  and rob them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=140.98s)]
*  One of the latest was last weekend at Nordstrom's when more than 30 masked people rushed into [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=142.26s)]
*  the store, broke display cases and made offer with around $300,000 worth of merchandise. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=146.66s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom provided additional funds to establish a retail theft task force [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=153.26s)]
*  and that, police say, led to the arrest of dozens of people wanted in several thefts [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  at different stores in a two-day operation in Bakersfield. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=162.66s)]
*  California Highway Patrol Chief Rodney Ellison. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=165.98s)]
*  During these two days of operations, CSP investigators arrested over 50 suspects for charges related [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=168.38s)]
*  to retail theft and recovered nearly $60,000 in product. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  Police say some of the theft rings are being organized on social media. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qaF3yIeQ0&t=178.54s)]
