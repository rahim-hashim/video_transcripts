*  Former President Obama said he understands people want to see change. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=55.56s)]
*  What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=59.64s)]
*  up in a way that is good for you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=67.84s)]

*  He asked supporters in Las Vegas this question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=90.52s)]
*  And I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=93.76s)]
*  Are you better off now than you were four years ago? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=96.56s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=103.12s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=104.12s)]

*  The ruling comes almost a year after Ohio voters approved a state constitutional amendment [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=118.22s)]
*  protecting abortion access, contraception, and other reproductive decisions. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=123.64s)]

*  and back. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=152.18s)]
*  The crew launched to the station back in March, and their planned return in August was delayed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=153.28s)]
*  several times. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=157.32s)]

*  It took the crew 34 hours to make the return home, safely splashing down under a canopy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=171.58s)]
*  of parachutes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=176.36s)]
*  In all, the crew spent 235 days in space, the longest of any SpaceX human mission. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khRGseoi3U8&t=177.64000000000001s)]
