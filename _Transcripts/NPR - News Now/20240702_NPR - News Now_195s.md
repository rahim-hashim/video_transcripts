# Supreme Court Hands Trump A Victory In Immunity Ruling: Delay | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o)
*  Former President Donald Trump's trial on election subversion charges is now unlikely to happen until after November's election, if at all. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=0.0s)]
*  And Hurricane Barrel is now a Category 5 storm and taking aim at Jamaica. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=8.4s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=13.0s)]
*  Hurricane Barrel remains a catastrophic Category 5 storm. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=17.28s)]
*  The National Hurricane Center in Florida says Barrel's top sustained winds are 165 miles per hour. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=20.84s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder says the storm is now eyeing Jamaica after moving through the southeastern Caribbean yesterday. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=27.28s)]
*  Authorities have not been able to assess the damage on two of Grenada's islands. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=33.6s)]
*  Communications are reported to be largely down, but the government says there have been reports of devastation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=38.0s)]
*  The National Hurricane Center in Miami says Barrel is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge when it passes near Jamaica on Wednesday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=43.6s)]
*  A hurricane warning is in effect there. Tropical storm warnings are up for the Dominican Republic and Haiti. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=51.8s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder reporting, there are reports of one death in Grenada. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=57.08s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court says former presidents have a presumption of immunity from prosecution for their official acts as president. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=62.44s)]
*  This decision will almost certainly delay former President Donald Trump's trial on election subversion charges until after the election, if it ever happens at all. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=70.44s)]
*  NPR's Nina Totenberg has more. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=80.52s)]
*  Writing for the Sixth Justice Conservative Court Majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said that presidents may not be prosecuted for exercising their core constitutional powers [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=82.8s)]
*  and that even after leaving office, they are entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for actions they took as president. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=93.24s)]
*  The court, however, did not resolve whether any of the election subversion charges could go forward against Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=101.64s)]
*  Rather, it sent the case back to the trial court judge to determine whether any of the charges were sufficiently outside of Trump's official duties to survive. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=108.56s)]
*  That ensures that Trump will get what he most wanted, delay until after the election. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=117.64s)]
*  And the court made it far more difficult to prosecute him or any other former president by limiting the evidence of corruption that a prosecutor could present to a jury. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=122.56s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=133.2s)]
*  Three new abortion-related laws have taken effect in Kansas, but doctors say the state's health department is not enforcing one of them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=135.76s)]
*  From member station KMUW, Rose Conlon reports the law requires doctors to report more patient data to state officials. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=142.96s)]
*  The law requires doctors to ask patients why they're getting an abortion and report their anonymized answers to officials for public release. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=150.68s)]
*  Patients can refuse to answer, but lawmakers voted against informing them of their right to refuse. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=159.12s)]
*  A group of doctors say the law is unconstitutional and are challenging it in court. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=165.28s)]
*  They say officials are not enforcing it for now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  The law was one of several backed by Kansas anti-abortion rights groups who have denounced the state's role as a key post-Roe abortion access point. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=172.72s)]
*  Laws directing more money to anti-abortion rights groups and making abortion coercion a felony also took effect. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=181.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Rose Conlon in Wichita. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UCdqscsH0o&t=191.08s)]
