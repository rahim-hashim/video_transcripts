# Helene Now A Tropical Storm As It Continues North | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0)
*  Hurricane Helene has been downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall last night on Florida's Gulf Coast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=0.0s)]
*  And former President Donald Trump will be campaigning today in Michigan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Cora McCollum from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=10.28s)]
*  Weather forecasters have downgraded Hurricane Helene to a tropical storm. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=14.92s)]
*  But when it made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast yesterday, it was a Category 4 hurricane. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=19.0s)]
*  NPR's Frank Morris says the storm's deadly consequences are moving north. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=23.68s)]
*  We do know at least three people are dead. One person was killed by a falling sign in Florida. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=28.32s)]
*  Two people in Georgia reportedly died in a possible tornado ahead of the hurricane. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=32.44s)]
*  I'm not clear on the injuries. There is some good news. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  The eye of the storm hit right between a state park and Flint Rock Wildlife Management Area. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=39.44s)]
*  So east of Tallahassee and west of Perry, Florida. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=43.88s)]
*  So it missed the beach communities that line much of the coast. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=46.8s)]
*  NPR's Frank Morris reporting. Heavy rain is falling in Georgia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=50.2s)]
*  The Atlanta area, including Hartsfield Jackson Airport, is now in a flash flood emergency. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=54.12s)]

*  Trump's visit to the state comes as voting by absentee ballot is getting underway. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=69.88s)]
*  Trump cast doubt on the votes counted by Detroit officials in 2020 [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=75.16s)]
*  as part of his disproven narrative of widespread fraud. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=78.84s)]
*  Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says voters can now track online [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=82.32s)]
*  when absentee ballots are accepted. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  A lot of what we saw in 2020 is when there's a vacuum of trusted information out there [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=88.48s)]
*  that then allows that blank slate to be filled with misinformation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=92.92s)]
*  Trump plans a town hall to again argue he'll save auto jobs, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=96.36s)]
*  in part by levying huge tariffs on some foreign imports. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=99.96s)]
*  Vice President Harris responded in a statement that Trump's vows are, quote, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=103.44s)]

*  rejecting the proposal. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=143.0s)]
*  A chorus of Israeli officials initially rejected the proposal from the U.S. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=144.64s)]
*  and other allies, saying Israel's campaign in Lebanon would continue [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=148.84s)]
*  with the goal of returning evacuated Israelis to their homes [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=152.84s)]

*  Meanwhile, air raid sirens have gone off across Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=175.04s)]
*  The military said there was rocket fire from Lebanon toward the northern city of Haifa [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pkrGjzsg0&t=178.44s)]
