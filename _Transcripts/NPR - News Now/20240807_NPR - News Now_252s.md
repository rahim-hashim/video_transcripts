# Harris Introduces Her Running Mate In Philadelphia | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc)
*  Vice President Harris introduced her new running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, last night at a rally in Philadelphia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=0.0s)]
*  And Missouri Congresswoman Cori Bush was defeated in her Democratic re-election primary yesterday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=13.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris will rally today in Wisconsin and Michigan with her new running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=17.0s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid says she formally introduced Walz at a big rally last night in Philadelphia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=23.0s)]
*  Harris spoke first, and the governor of Minnesota, as you know, is not necessarily a household name to many. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=28.0s)]
*  So she spent a lot of time just running through his resume and explaining why she chose him. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=34.0s)]
*  She talked about his strong record on policies like paid family leave, gun safety, and reproductive rights. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=39.0s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid reporting. Republican Vice Presidential nominee J.D. Vance held a counter rally in Philadelphia yesterday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=45.0s)]
*  He criticized his Democratic opponent's record. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=53.0s)]
*  Tim Walz's record is a joke. He's been one of the most far-left radicals in the entire United States government at any level. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=56.0s)]
*  Vance says he did phone Walz to congratulate him. Vance will campaign in Wisconsin today, too. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=65.0s)]
*  Two-term Democratic Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri was defeated yesterday in her re-election primary. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=71.0s)]
*  She lost to St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=77.0s)]
*  St. Louis Public Radio's Will Bauer reports Bush's loss follows the primary defeat of fellow congressional squad member Jamal Bowman of New York. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=81.0s)]
*  Unofficial results show Bush lost by a five percentage point margin in the Democratic primary. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=90.0s)]
*  This race turned into one of the most expensive in American history. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=95.0s)]
*  It was largely fueled by pro-Israel groups critical of Bush's statements about the Middle Eastern government, also a factor in Bowman's ouster. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=99.0s)]
*  Bell says the district is ready for change. He referenced the squad in his acceptance speech. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=107.0s)]
*  Progressive should actually make progress. And that's what I've done my entire career. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=112.0s)]
*  Because the St. Louis region is heavily Democratic, Bell is favored to win in November. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=118.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Will Bauer in St. Louis. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=123.0s)]
*  Thousands of additional police officers are deploying in British streets ahead of dozens of rallies planned for today by far-right extremist groups. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=127.0s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from Tamwith, England, where a hotel housing asylum seekers was attacked. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=136.0s)]
*  Far-right mobs have attacked mosques, immigrants, even immigration law offices across Britain. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=143.0s)]
*  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer says minorities need to feel safe in this country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=149.0s)]
*  They will be safe. We're doing everything we can to ensure that where a police response is needed, it's in place. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=154.0s)]
*  A former prosecutor, Starmer says he's speeding suspects to court. Some are already in prison and face travel bans. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=161.0s)]
*  The UK government also has a special unit flagging hate speech online and is asking social media companies to remove it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=168.0s)]
*  The violence began more than a week ago based on misinformation about a murder suspect, but has spread into all-out race riots targeting Muslims, immigrants and anyone of color. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=175.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, Tamwith, England. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=186.0s)]
*  As Russia's invading army grinds forward in eastern Ukraine, Ukraine's athletes say they're using the Summer Olympics to show their country's strength and resilience. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=189.0s)]
*  So far, Ukraine has won seven medals, and NPR's Brian Mann has more from Paris. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=198.0s)]
*  When Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Maguchik won gold here, she dedicated the medal to her country's army fighting the Russians. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=204.0s)]
*  Thanks to them, we had the opportunity to be here, she said. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=211.0s)]
*  Ukrainians competing in Paris have won two gold, two silver and three bronze medals, an astonishing performance given the terrible toll of the war. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=214.0s)]
*  A survey by the British government found nearly 500 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=223.0s)]
*  Thousands of other Ukrainian athletes can't compete in sport because they're part of the war effort. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=232.0s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted on social media about his country's Olympic medals. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=237.0s)]
*  Ukrainians know how to be strong and how to win, Zelensky said. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=243.0s)]
*  Brian Mann, NPR News, Paris. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFumhouXxc&t=246.0s)]
