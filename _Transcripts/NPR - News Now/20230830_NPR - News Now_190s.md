**NPR - News Now:** [August 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c)
*  Hurricane Edalia has made landfall along Florida's Gulf Coast as a major category three storm. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=0.0s)]
*  And a new survey shows labor unions remain popular in the U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=6.48s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kristin Wright with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=10.72s)]
*  Hurricane Edalia has made landfall along Florida's Gulf Coast. In the past hour, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=15.76s)]
*  sustained wind speeds decreased slightly, downgrading it to a category three storm. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=20.56s)]
*  But storm surge and catastrophic flooding remain a serious threat to communities. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=26.24s)]
*  Elliott Triteau of member station WUFT reports hospitals in Florida are ready to receive a [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  possible influx of patients. Hospitals in north central Florida are preparing for what could be [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=37.68s)]
*  a lot of patients with storm-related injuries. Matt Shannon is an emergency physician with the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=42.8s)]
*  University of Florida. He says it's happened with every hurricane affecting the area. In his [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=47.28s)]
*  experience, the wave of patients comes not during the hurricane but after. Most people will have the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=51.52s)]
*  good sense to stay home and button down the hatches. We tend to get large emergency department [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=56.720000000000006s)]
*  volumes the day after those storms pass through. He says to take precautions like wearing eye [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=61.84s)]
*  protection during post storm cleanup. For anyone riding out the storm, he says to use common sense, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=67.12s)]
*  wait for it to blow over, and if you have a small injury, take care of it at home. But if it's a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=72.24000000000001s)]

*  very clearly that as a Commerce Secretary, it's my job to both protect what we must, to protect [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=113.92s)]
*  our technology, and to promote where we can. A new Gallup survey shows labor unions remain popular [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=121.92s)]
*  in the U.S. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports. The survey actually found public approval of unions has [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=129.52s)]
*  fallen a few percentage points from a year ago. It's now at 67 percent, which is still higher than [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  it's been for most of the past half century. Support for union workers also appears strong. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=142.56s)]

*  At the same time, a sizable minority of people question what good unions do. One out of three [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50SI7zMYR2c&t=159.51999999999998s)]
