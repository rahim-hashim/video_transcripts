*  on a nonbinding resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=49.44s)]
*  The U.S. has already vetoed a similar resolution [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=54.16s)]
*  in the UN Security Council. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  The fate of Harvard University's president, Claudine Gay, remains unclear. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  She's facing calls to resign over her congressional testimony [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=64.39999999999999s)]

*  She's also got support from some faculty and students. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=80.64s)]
*  But those still supporting Gay are not all fans. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=84.08s)]
*  Some just don't want outside political or financial pressure to decide her fate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=88.56s)]
*  And this pro-Palestinian student who asked not to be identified [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=93.04s)]
*  for fear of harassment says he doesn't want her fired for fear of who could come next. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=96.68s)]
*  If the concern were that we're general student safety, then I would be more sympathetic. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=101.64s)]
*  But if the calls are simply on one side, I worry that the blowback towards students [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  from a replacement to Gay would be quite bad. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=109.68s)]
*  So far, only silence from those who will actually make the decision. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=112.32s)]
*  That's Harvard's governing board who've been meeting for two days. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=115.92s)]
*  Tovia Smith, NPR News, Cambridge. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=119.36s)]
*  A federal jury in San Francisco has ruled that Google violated U.S. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=121.4s)]
*  competition laws in the way it has been running its Android app store. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=125.72s)]
*  As NPR's Bobby Allen reports, a federal judge will now decide what changes [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=130.84s)]
*  Google will have to make to its multi-billion dollar smartphone marketplace. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=135.68s)]
*  Google takes a cut of up to 30% from every purchase made in its Android app store. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  And Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, sued Google over this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=145.36s)]
*  It argued that consumers should have more options available for processing app store payments. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=149.96s)]
*  Over a four week trial, Epic Games said Google abused its power to keep out competition [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=153.96s)]
*  and extract hefty fees on every transaction. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  Now a jury has returned a verdict agreeing that Google violated the law by designing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=161.68s)]
*  an app store that put up barriers to rival companies. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  A federal judge will decide in January what steps Google will have to take to address [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=169.56s)]
*  the unlawful behavior. Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=174.04s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3I4Xktyto0&t=177.48s)]
