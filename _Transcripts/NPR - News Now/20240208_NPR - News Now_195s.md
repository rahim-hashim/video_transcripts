*  appear on Colorado's primary ballots and the U.S. has killed a commander of an Iranian-backed [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=4.4s)]
*  militia in Iraq. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=9.88s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments today on whether Donald Trump can be disqualified [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=16.76s)]
*  from Colorado's primary ballot. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=20.68s)]
*  The Colorado Supreme Court removed him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=22.88s)]
*  The state judges cited the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and said Trump's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=24.88s)]
*  actions around January 6th amounted to insurrection. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=30.02s)]
*  Georgetown law professor Michelle Goodwin says Trump has several defenses against this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=34.08s)]
*  argument. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=38.92s)]
*  Amongst those of his defenses is that he should, in fact, be on the ballot and the voters of [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=39.92s)]
*  Colorado should be able to decide whether they want to vote for him or not. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=45.0s)]

*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports lawmakers are expected to grill them about the high cost [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=78.12s)]
*  of prescription drugs in the U.S. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=83.16s)]
*  Independent Senator Bernie Sanders has called out the pharmaceutical companies for charging [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=85.8s)]
*  more for prescription drugs in the U.S. than in any other country. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=90.47999999999999s)]

*  and executive compensation. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=110.6s)]
*  And they did on research and development. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=112.8s)]
*  The report also compared drug prices in the U.S. with other countries. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=115.72s)]
*  The list includes the diabetes drug Genuvia, which cost $6,900 in the U.S. compared to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=120.0s)]
*  $200 in France. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=126.8s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=128.76s)]

*  He led one of the most powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=143.76s)]
*  The airstrike is the latest between the U.S. and Iraqi militias. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  And NPR's Jane Araf reports from Baghdad it's expected to have repercussions. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  The airstrike on a vehicle in a crowded Baghdad neighborhood killed a commander of Qatab Hezbollah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZHlnO0aPo&t=157.35999999999999s)]
