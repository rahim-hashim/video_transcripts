# Biden Speaks With Netanyahu Today After Aid Workers' Deaths | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw)
*  President Biden is scheduled to speak today to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=0.0s)]
*  And former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee raised more [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=4.7s)]
*  than $65 million in March. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=8.3s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=11.48s)]
*  I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=12.48s)]
*  President Biden is scheduled to speak today to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=16.04s)]
*  The call is the first between them since this week's deadly Israeli strike killed seven [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=20.06s)]
*  aid workers from World Central Kitchen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=23.84s)]
*  They were delivering food in Gaza to starving Palestinians. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=26.22s)]
*  Israel has admitted responsibility, saying it was a mistake. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=29.98s)]
*  World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres says Israel does have the right to defend [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=33.64s)]
*  itself, but... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=38.46s)]
*  But defending your people is not killing everybody else around. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=39.46s)]
*  I've been in Gaza myself. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=45.38s)]
*  I met some of the people that died were my friends. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=48.14s)]
*  When I served with them, some is the nicest angel you will ever meet. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=54.18s)]
*  It's a woman that is being in so many places around the world feeding people. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=60.58s)]
*  Andres was speaking to Israel's Keshet-12 news. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=66.82s)]
*  Three of the aid workers who were killed were from the United Kingdom. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=70.78s)]
*  More than 600 legal experts in the UK have signed a letter urging British Prime Minister [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=73.58s)]
*  Rishi Zunach to halt British weapons exports to Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=78.06s)]
*  And Piers Lauren Freyer has more from London. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=81.78s)]
*  Three retired UK Supreme Court justices are among those who've signed this letter. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=84.04s)]
*  It says the UK could be complicit in quote, grave breaches of international law if it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=88.36s)]
*  continues to ship arms to Israel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=93.12s)]
*  And it says there's quote, plausible risk of genocide in Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=95.54s)]
*  The UK makes 15% of components for Israel's F-35 combat aircraft. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=99.44s)]
*  The growing number of UK politicians say they're concerned that some of those UK components [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=104.8s)]
*  may have been used in Israeli attacks on UK citizens. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=109.76s)]
*  Three of the world's central kitchen aid workers killed in Gaza this week were British. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=113.36s)]
*  Even before that though, polls showed a majority of people here want their government to halt [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=118.12s)]
*  arms exports to Israel and believe Israel's actions in Gaza violate human rights. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=122.48s)]
*  Lauren Freyer and Pierre News, London. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=127.72s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee raised more than $65 million [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=130.24s)]
*  in March. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=135.76s)]
*  And Piers Franco-Ordonez reports on the fundraising haul as Trump restructures his party's leadership. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=136.76s)]
*  The former president and the Republican National Committee said they ended the month with over [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=143.44000000000003s)]
*  $93 million in cash. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=147.4s)]
*  The announcement comes as Republicans seek to close a significant fundraising gap with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  President Biden and the Democratic Party. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=154.36s)]
*  Susie Wiles, a senior advisor for the Trump campaign, said in a statement that the March [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=157.08s)]
*  numbers are a testament to their efforts to ramp up fundraising. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=161.06s)]
*  And she took a shot at President Biden's recent fundraising work, saying that Trump and the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=164.96s)]
*  Republicans are not the quote, beneficiaries of self-interested largesse from Hollywood [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=169.02s)]
*  and Silicon Valley elites, but from working class Americans. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  They have a lot of catching up to do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=178.18s)]
*  Biden's campaign has been out raising Trump and money raised from both large donations [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=180.02s)]
*  and small individual contributions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  Franco-Ordonez, NPR News. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKVvvshYDbw&t=187.94s)]
