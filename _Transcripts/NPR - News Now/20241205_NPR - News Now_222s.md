**NPR - News Now:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Ta9OT8tyo)
*  The search continues for the person who killed the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Ta9OT8tyo&t=0.0s)]
*  And a vote of no confidence yesterday has left France without a prime minister. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Ta9OT8tyo&t=5.04s)]

*  Tisch says the attack was planned by a person who waited outside the hotel for Thompson to arrive. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Ta9OT8tyo&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  Every indication is that this was a premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Ta9OT8tyo&t=39.68s)]
