# More Evidence Found Linking Suspect To CEO's Killing | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc)
*  Investigators say they have found more evidence linking Luigi Mangione to the killing of United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=0.0s)]
*  Healthcare's CEO last week. And rebel groups are working together to form a transitional [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=4.96s)]
*  government in Syria. Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=10.24s)]
*  top stories. President-elect Trump's nominee for defense secretary Pete Hegseth is continuing to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  meet with senators as he seeks their support. He's faced criticism over allegations of sexual [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=20.0s)]
*  misconduct and financial impropriety. He denies the accusations. Maine Republican Senator Susan [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=25.28s)]
*  Collins says she held a long conversation with Hegseth yesterday. I did press him on some of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=31.44s)]
*  the personal allegations against him. I'm really relying on the FBI background check. She spoke to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  WCSH-TV in Portland, Maine. Collins says she will wait for Hegseth's confirmation hearing before [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  making a decision. Investigators say they have found more evidence linking Luigi Mangione to the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=54.16s)]
*  killing of United Healthcare's CEO Brian Thompson in New York City. NPR's Maria Aspin reports on [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=60.0s)]
*  what police are saying about a gun found in Mangione's possession. Police arrested Mangione [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=66.24s)]
*  after a five-day manhunt for the person who shot and killed Thompson in Manhattan last week. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=72.0s)]
*  The 26-year-old suspect is being held in Pennsylvania on weapons and forgery charges. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=77.36s)]
*  He is fighting extradition to New York, where he faces charges for second-degree murder. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  But the gun in his possession has been sent to the NYPD crime lab, Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=87.84s)]
*  We were able to match that gun to the three shell casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  the homicide. She also said that the fingerprints on the gun matched the prints on other evidence [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=99.84s)]
*  found near the crime scene in New York. Maria Aspin, NPR News, New York. Reporters in Syria [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=104.72s)]
*  say that an American man has been found barefoot in a suburb of Syria's capital, Damascus. He said [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=111.2s)]
*  his name is Travis Timmerman. He said he had walked from a notorious Syrian prison. He's believed to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  have gone missing last May from Hungary, but Timmerman said he crossed into Syria on foot [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  and on a pilgrimage. Meanwhile, Syrian rebels are putting together a transitional government [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=128.8s)]
*  out of the various militias that toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad just days ago. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=134.32s)]
*  And Piers Hadil al-Shalchi reports there is still a lot of uncertainty about what the new country [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=139.92s)]
*  will look like. The new prime minister, Mohammed al-Bashir, promised that the new Syrian transitional [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=146.0s)]
*  government will be inclusive in a country that's made up of many sects and religions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  But recently at a press conference, two flags stood next to him. One of the new Syrian flag [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=156.16s)]
*  and the other a white flag affiliated with Islamist groups. Bashir took it down at his [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  next appearance after an outcry by pluralist Syrians online. Their fears may be justified. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=166.56s)]
*  Bashir's group is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham or HTS and it was affiliated with Al Qaeda before breaking [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=172.32s)]
*  off years ago. And the group's head, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, is considered a terrorist by the United [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=177.84s)]
*  States with a 10 million dollar bounty on his head. Hadil al-Shalchi, NPR News, Damascus. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=182.96s)]
*  Automaker General Motors is getting out of the robotaxi business. GM says it will continue to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=189.12s)]
*  work on self-driving features. NPR's Camilla Dominozki explains. GM's subsidiary crews had [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=194.4s)]
*  autonomous taxis on the road in some cities. But after billions of dollars of investment, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=200.56s)]
*  the robotaxi service wasn't paying off. GM says it will merge crews into the teams that work on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=205.76s)]
*  software for GM vehicles. Partial autonomy as a premium feature rather than full autonomy as a [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=211.44s)]
*  taxi service. GM's super cruise feature for hands-free driving costs thousands of dollars [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=218.24s)]
*  and a subscription. Google's Waymo is the biggest player remaining in the robotaxi business. Tesla [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=223.84s)]
*  still has ambitions to launch its own service. Camilla Dominozki, NPR News. Animals like sharks, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=229.68s)]
*  dogs, and parakeets develop their scales, hair, and feathers using a shared genetic toolkit. But [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Jonathan Lambert reports new research shows crocodiles are a bit different. Look at the head [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=241.76s)]
*  of a crocodile and you'll see a mishmash of weirdly shaped scales. A new study in the journal Nature [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=247.36s)]
*  finds that these irregular patterns aren't laid down by genes like other scales but instead arise [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=253.04s)]
*  from a largely physical process. The skin on their heads grows faster than the underlying tissues [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=258.4s)]
*  causing folding that creates this irregular pattern. Computer models of this physical process [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=263.68s)]
*  were able to recreate the different facial patterns of a variety of crocodile species. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=268.08s)]
*  This shows that complex biological patterns can arise without complicated genetic changes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VI93UnFnlc&t=273.12s)]
