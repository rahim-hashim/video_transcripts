**NPR - News Now:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c)
*  A New York judge has ruled President-elect Trump cannot claim presidential immunity in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=0.0s)]
*  his hush money convictions. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  And the investigation continues into yesterday's deadly school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=6.7s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=11.92s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=12.92s)]
*  A judge in New York has rejected an effort by President-elect Trump to toss out the 34-count [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=16.4s)]
*  felony convictions in his hush money trial. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=21.64s)]
*  And Pierce Ryan Lucas reports. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=24.64s)]
*  New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Marchand rejected Trump's argument that prosecutors [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=26.5s)]
*  shouldn't have been allowed to offer certain evidence from Trump's time in office in light [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=30.68s)]
*  of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=34.82s)]
*  In his 41-page ruling, Marchand says that the evidence in question relates to Trump's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=38.3s)]
*  unofficial conduct and thus is not covered by the Supreme Court's presidential immunity [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  decision. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Trump was convicted in July of 34 criminal counts of falsifying business records related [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=48.7s)]
*  to hush money payments he made to an adult film star. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=53.7s)]
*  Trump's attorneys also have put forward other grounds as well for the case to be dismissed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  Ryan Lucas, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=61.82000000000001s)]
*  President-elect Trump's nominees continue to visit senators in hopes of winning support [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=64.22s)]
*  in their confirmation hearings. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=68.66s)]
*  That includes Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=70.64s)]
*  Jr. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=75.26s)]
*  He has spread falsehoods and conspiracy theories about vaccines. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=76.26s)]
*  Kennedy met yesterday with Oklahoma Republican Senator Mark Wayne Mullen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=80.36s)]
*  Mullen says Kennedy has told him he will not try to end the use of the polio vaccine, but [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=84.52s)]
*  the GOP senator said Kennedy is skeptical about several health issues. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=90.28s)]
*  I think he's going to question science and I'm glad he's going to question it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=94.66s)]
*  Some senators say they will question Kennedy about his views on vaccines and other health [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=97.76s)]
*  matters. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=102.44s)]
*  The CEO of SoftBank, Yasuhoshi Sun, is pledging to invest 100 billion dollars in the U.S. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=103.66s)]
*  over the next four years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=110.08s)]
*  As NPR's Bobby Allen reports, Sun is the latest tech mogul offering to spend big to court [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=111.66s)]
*  President-elect Trump. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=117.0s)]
*  Masuhoshi Sun's SoftBank, a Japanese financial juggernaut, hasn't explained where the 100 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=118.6s)]
*  billion dollars will come from, but he has said it will be spent on investments in A.I. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=123.2s)]
*  startups and other ventures. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=127.56s)]
*  It comes just as other tech executives like Metta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=129.2s)]
*  and OpenAI's Sam Altman have all announced million-dollar donations to Trump's inaugural [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=133.04s)]
*  fund. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=137.88s)]
*  The Sun Valley historian Margaret O'Meara says tech companies have donated to inaugural [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=138.88s)]
*  funds before, but this time is different. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=142.68s)]
*  We're giving lots of money and we're making it very clear how much we're giving and who [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=145.6s)]
*  we're giving it to and why. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=149.44s)]
*  That's something that was a departure from past forms. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=151.48s)]
*  O'Meara says for some tech executives like Zuckerberg and Bezos, who have clashed with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=154.26s)]
*  Trump, the publicity over the donations could be fodder for a fresh start. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=157.7s)]
*  Bobby Allen, NPR News. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=162.72s)]
*  The video-sharing app TikTok and its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, are appealing to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=164.74s)]
*  the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=169.96s)]
*  They want the court to block a federal law that bans the app starting next month. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=171.62s)]
*  Lower courts have refused to step in. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=176.5s)]
*  This may be TikTok's last legal effort to save itself in the U.S. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=178.9s)]
*  It's not clear if President-elect Trump may step in. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=183.46s)]
*  Authorities in Madison, Wisconsin, say a 15-year-old girl opened fire at a Christian school yesterday. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=186.34s)]

*  The biggest question, why, that's still unclear. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=204.22s)]
*  Police say they're still trying to piece together a motive. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=207.02s)]

*  Madison police say they're working with federal officials to trace the origins of the gun. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  The police chief said late Monday it's not clear how exactly a 15-year-old got this gun. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=217.82s)]
*  Sarah Lear reporting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=223.29999999999998s)]

*  Authorities in Russia say a bomb hidden in a scooter has killed a top Russian general [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=230.06s)]
*  and an aide in Moscow. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=234.94s)]
*  NPR has learned Ukraine was behind the assassination. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=236.57999999999998s)]

*  Chauvin is in prison for Floyd's murder and for violating his civil rights. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugGM3u8G72c&t=259.62s)]
