# Trump Taps Final Cabinet Picks; Transition Lags In Other Ways | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8)
*  Despite nominating his candidates for his cabinet, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump's transition continues to lag behind in other ways. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=3.0s)]
*  And Israeli officials say they're close to agreeing on terms for a ceasefire with Hezbollah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=7.5s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=13.0s)]
*  Over the past few days, President-elect Donald Trump completed nominating all his candidates for his incoming cabinet. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=17.0s)]
*  That includes Brooke Rollins to be Agriculture Secretary, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=23.0s)]
*  former Texas state lawmaker Scott Turner as Housing and Urban Development Secretary, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=26.0s)]
*  Oregon Congresswoman Lorie Chavez de Riemer as Labor Secretary, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=31.0s)]
*  and Wall Street investor Scott Besson for Treasury Secretary. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=35.0s)]
*  They joined Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth and others. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=38.0s)]
*  But NPR's Amy Held reports Trump's transition process is lagging behind in other ways. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=42.0s)]
*  Trump's picks are largely loyal, light on related experience, and several have been accused of sexual misconduct. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=48.0s)]
*  Documents remain unsigned by the Trump transition team, including those that would reveal donor names. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=55.0s)]
*  And Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota tells ABC's This Week those to vet nominees. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=61.0s)]
*  If they keep delaying on these background checks, we will have a delay in getting these cabinet officials in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=67.0s)]
*  But Republican Senator Bill Haggerty of Tennessee says voters don't care about FBI background checks, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=73.0s)]
*  and he supports recess appointments allowing Trump to go around Senate confirmation altogether. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=78.0s)]
*  I think everything should be on the table. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=84.0s)]
*  The Republican-led Senate is set to start the confirmation process next year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=86.0s)]
*  Amy Held, NPR News. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=90.0s)]
*  There's still a lot of focus on other picks, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=92.0s)]
*  NPR's Lou Garrett says he has drawn attention for his opposition to vaccines. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=98.0s)]
*  Kennedy has received bipartisan criticism for these anti-vaccine stances. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=102.0s)]
*  He hasn't yet visited Capitol Hill or met with senators, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=106.0s)]
*  but since his nomination, he has found some support or just openness among bipartisan members of Congress. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=109.0s)]
*  New Jersey Senator Cory Booker posted a video on social media criticizing U.S. food systems, saying, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=115.0s)]
*  While Booker did not mention R.F.K. Jr. by name, this message does echo portions of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again agenda. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=124.0s)]
*  NPR's Lou Garrett reporting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=131.0s)]
*  Israeli officials say they are getting closer to reaching a ceasefire agreement in the war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=133.0s)]
*  As NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv, officials say some disputes remain. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=139.0s)]
*  Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog says Israel is close to reaching an agreement in Lebanon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=144.0s)]
*  He said it could be only a matter of days. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=149.0s)]
*  Lebanon and Hezbollah had no immediate comment. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=152.0s)]
*  An official familiar with the talks who was not authorized to publicize details and spoke anonymously [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=155.0s)]
*  told NPR one remaining dispute is Israel's demand for the right to strike Lebanon in the future if it detects threats. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=160.0s)]
*  This weekend saw some of the fiercest violence between Israel and Hezbollah in months. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=167.0s)]
*  Israeli attacks killed at least 84 people Saturday in Lebanon, officials say. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=172.0s)]
*  And Israel says Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets into Israel on Sunday. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=177.0s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=182.0s)]
*  Conservative advocates say they're hopeful the next Congress will work to limit gender-affirming care [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=186.0s)]
*  when Republicans control the House and Senate next year. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=191.0s)]
*  NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin has more. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=194.0s)]
*  John Schweppe is Policy Director for the American Principles Project, a conservative advocacy group. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=197.0s)]
*  He would like to see the new Republican-controlled Congress move to limit who has access to gender-affirming care using limits on insurance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=202.0s)]
*  One of our goals is to create a Hyde Amendment for so-called gender-affirming care. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=210.0s)]
*  We don't believe taxpayer funding should go towards that for minors or for adults. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=215.0s)]
*  The Hyde Amendment is a 1977 policy that says you can't use any federal dollars for abortion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=220.0s)]
*  If the same kind of policy were to be put in place for gender-affirming care, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=226.0s)]
*  low-income people on Medicaid essentially wouldn't have access to the care. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=230.0s)]
*  Such an effort would certainly be met with legal challenges from LGBTQ advocates. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=234.0s)]
*  Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR News. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=239.0s)]
*  There's a hearing in Los Angeles today to consider a request to reduce the life-without parole sentence of Eric and Lyle Menendez. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=241.0s)]
*  The brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in the brutal 1989 slayings of their parents. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=249.0s)]
*  Steve Futterman reports. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=255.0s)]
*  The request comes as attorneys say there is new evidence supporting the brothers' claim that they were sexually molested by their father, Jose Menendez. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=257.0s)]
*  Attorney Mark Garagos is representing the brothers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=265.0s)]
*  Under the current state of the law, they're eligible to have, and the court has the discretion, to recall the L. Wapix sentence, life-without parole. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=268.0s)]
*  The district attorney supports reducing the sentence to 50 years to life. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=279.0s)]
*  With the more than 30 years the brothers have already served, that would make them eligible for parole. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=283.0s)]
*  Complicating the issue is the fact that the current DA is set to be replaced next month, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=288.0s)]
*  and the new DA says he needs to review the case before announcing his position. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=293.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Steve Futterman in Los Angeles. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=299.0s)]
*  The movie's Gladiator 2 and Wicked Part 1, the combination the film industry calls Glick-It, did not rise to Barbenheimer Heights at the box office this weekend. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=303.0s)]
*  NPR's Bob Mandela reports it did power Hollywood to its best pre-Thanksgiving weekend in 11 years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=313.0s)]
*  Gladiator 2 took in a hefty $55 million this weekend in North America. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=319.0s)]
*  You have something in you. I knew it from the start. Did you now? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=323.0s)]
*  And Wicked was, as its big song suggests, with $114 million in the till. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=327.0s)]
*  That is easily the biggest domestic opening ever for an adaptation of a Broadway musical, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=335.0s)]
*  and enough to make this pre-Thanksgiving weekend for all films the best since 2013, proving that movies and cinemas can still be... [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=340.0s)]
*  Popular. I know about popular. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=348.0s)]
*  Both films also opened overseas. Worldwide, Wicked has taken in $163 million, while Gladiator 2, which opened in some markets 10 days ago, has accumulated $221 million. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=352.0s)]
*  Bob Mandela, NPR News. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=364.0s)]
*  Holiday season is here, and with it comes the feasts. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=366.0s)]
*  NPR's Regina Barber reports on how some people may be counteracting big meals in unhealthy ways. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=369.0s)]
*  A hospital group in Florida, Orlando Health, recently surveyed over a thousand Americans nationally and found that during the holidays, the tactics to stay healthy might be counterproductive. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=376.0s)]
*  One in four people surveyed thought it was a good idea to skip meals in preparation of a large holiday feast. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=385.0s)]
*  Dietitians actually advised people to eat regularly to help people not overeat during one meal. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=391.0s)]
*  The survey also found that a third of participants felt they needed to detox themselves after overeating. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=396.0s)]
*  Dietitians stressed that that is not needed and could even be harmful because the body's kidneys and livers are experts at doing that detox. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=402.0s)]
*  Lastly, health professionals say enjoy the holidays. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=409.0s)]
*  Only eating one healthy meal or one high in calories isn't going to change your health dramatically. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=413.0s)]
*  Regina Barber, NPR News. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=418.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Kuhlman, NPR News. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpqWgSQX_V8&t=420.0s)]
