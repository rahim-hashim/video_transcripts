# Search Intensifies for Missing Submersible as Underwater Noises Detected | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU)
*  The search continues for a missing submersible in the North Atlantic Ocean. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal judge has struck down an Arkansas law banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=4.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=10.0s)]
*  The Coast Guard says a plane has picked up underwater noises as teams search for a missing submersible in the North Atlantic. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=15.0s)]
*  Nothing's been found. The sea vessel is owned by a private company, Ocean Gate. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=22.0s)]
*  From member station WBUR, Walter Wothman says concerns have previously been raised about the submersible. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=26.0s)]
*  People have raised safety concerns about Ocean Gate's submersible Titan before. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=32.0s)]
*  We obtained federal court documents from a contract dispute in 2018 that showed the company's former director of marine operations was concerned about the vessel's structural integrity. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=37.0s)]
*  That employee, David Lockridge, was an experienced submarine pilot and said Ocean Gate didn't properly test the submersible's carbon fiber hull. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=47.0s)]
*  Walter Wothman reporting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=55.0s)]
*  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell updates lawmakers today about inflation and the central bank's efforts to fight it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=57.0s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reports consumer prices are still climbing in the U.S., but not as fast as they were a year ago. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=63.0s)]
*  Inflation has cooled from just over 9 percent a year ago to 4 percent last month. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=70.0s)]
*  That improvement's given the Federal Reserve a little breathing room. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=75.0s)]
*  Last week, Powell and his colleagues decided to leave interest rates unchanged. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=78.0s)]
*  Fed policymakers have hinted that more rate hikes could be in store, however. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=82.0s)]
*  Lawmakers will likely grill Powell about the Fed's strategy as it tries to bring inflation down to its 2 percent target, where it was before the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=86.0s)]
*  Separately, a Senate committee holds a hearing today on three nominees for the Fed's governing board, including a newcomer, Adriana Kugler. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=95.0s)]
*  She's an economist who previously served in the Labor Department and is now at the World Bank. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=102.0s)]
*  Kugler, who grew up in Colombia, would be the first Latina to serve on the central bank's governing body. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=106.0s)]
*  Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=111.0s)]
*  A federal judge has permanently struck down an Arkansas law banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=113.0s)]
*  From member station KUAR, Daniel Breen reports. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=119.0s)]
*  The ruling by U.S. District Judge James Moody, Jr. says Arkansas violated its citizens' constitutional rights to equal protection when it banned all gender-affirming treatments for people under 18. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=123.0s)]
*  The 80-page ruling says depriving trans minors of treatments like hormone therapy would cause them irreparable harm, and that delaying care until adulthood would force teens to go through changes inconsistent with their gender identity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=135.0s)]
*  The ruling comes after an eight-day trial in December where several of the state's witnesses admitted they didn't have experience treating transgender teens and offered no evidence to dispute decades of medical research. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=148.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Daniel Breen in Little Rock. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=159.0s)]
*  China says President Biden made an absurd, provocative statement last night. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=162.0s)]
*  Biden said Chinese leader Xi Jinping didn't know about a suspected Chinese spy balloon that was eventually shot down by the U.S. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=167.0s)]
*  Biden said that was a great embarrassment for dictators. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=175.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Biden will see Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House tonight. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=179.0s)]
*  That comes ahead of tomorrow's state dinner and official meeting with Modi. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=184.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEmhqfhpbAU&t=188.0s)]
