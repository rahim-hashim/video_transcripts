*  The Israeli military says it's expanding operations in Gaza with both infantry troops [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=29.68s)]

*  There have been only sporadic reports of ground clashes, but the military says Israeli troops [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=35.24s)]
*  are identifying Hamas fighters and the air force is striking from above. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Israeli troops entered northern Gaza on Friday night, and that's where the forces appear [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=45.519999999999996s)]

*  Hankison was already acquitted of similar charges in state court last year, but that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=82.2s)]
*  case was about him endangering Taylor's neighbors. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=86.18s)]
*  This federal trial is important because it's the first time any of the officers involved [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=88.98s)]
*  are facing charges specifically for what they did to Taylor. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=93.10000000000001s)]

*  president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkq8wguOAlk&t=122.9s)]
