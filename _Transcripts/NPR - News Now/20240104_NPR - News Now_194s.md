*  And former President Donald Trump is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to put him back on the Colorado primary ballot. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=6.5s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=12.3s)]
*  A federal judge in New York has released a trove of documents naming dozens of powerful men [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=16.8s)]

*  The fact that these men are named in legal filings doesn't mean they did anything wrong or faced criminal allegations. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=40.5s)]
*  These documents also reveal new testimony that claims to paint a more detailed portrait of Epstein's secretive world, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=46.3s)]
*  where women, some of the minors, were allegedly exploited, sexually assaulted, and raped. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=52.6s)]

*  says the issue is about the plain text of the Constitution and the law is on their side. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=114.6s)]
*  Carrie Johnson, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=120.1s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson and dozens of congressional Republicans visited the southern border in Texas yesterday. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=122.6s)]
*  They're demanding that President Biden do more to stop migrants from entering the U.S. illegally. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=129.1s)]

*  But Republican negotiator, Oklahoma Senator James Langford, says they're not that close. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=151.1s)]

*  and is already saying they're going to veto that, and the Democratic Senate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=162.1s)]
*  Complicating matters. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=166.1s)]
*  Conservative Republicans in the House say they plan to block a separate government funding bill unless they get the immigration bill that they want. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=167.1s)]
*  So the federal government could soon face another potential shutdown. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=176.1s)]
*  Separately, the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee says that members will take up impeachment articles against the Homeland Security Secretary next week over the border. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMEkurgfzyI&t=180.1s)]
