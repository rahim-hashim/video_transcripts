# White House Scrambling After Reporter Was Sent War Plans | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs)
*  The White House is scrambling after a reporter was included in a text chat about military plans to attack Yemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Trump administration is invoking the state's secrets privilege in a case involving deportation flights of migrants. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=14.0s)]
*  The White House National Security Council says it is reviewing an incident. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=19.0s)]
*  A journalist says he was apparently inadvertently added to a group chat where top administration officials discussed planned U.S. military action. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=22.0s)]
*  And Piers Chambers-Keith reports. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=30.0s)]
*  Atlantic Magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg somehow got included in a group chat on the messaging app Signal, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=32.0s)]
*  where the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, and others were discussing plans for an attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=39.0s)]
*  When asked about the story and the breach hours after it came to light, President Trump said it was news to him. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=48.0s)]
*  Well, it couldn't have been very effective because the attack was very effective. I can tell you that. I don't know anything about it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=55.0s)]
*  You're telling me about it for the first time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=61.0s)]
*  A spokesman for the National Security Council confirms the chat, which broke with longstanding national security protocol, appears to be authentic. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=63.0s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=72.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is now invoking state secrets privilege in a case involving deportation flights. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=74.0s)]
*  NPR's Joel Rose reports the judge is continuing to demand more information about them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=80.0s)]
*  Federal Judge James Boasberg has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members under a rarely used wartime law. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=85.0s)]
*  And Boasberg is pushing the Trump administration to explain whether it defied his orders when it allowed two deportation flights to continue. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=94.0s)]
*  But the Justice Department has stonewalled, refusing to answer the judge's questions about the timing and other operational details of the flights. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=101.0s)]
*  Now the Justice Department is invoking the state secrets privilege, arguing in a court filing that answering the judge's questions even under seal would harm, quote, diplomatic and national security concerns. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=108.0s)]
*  Joel Rose, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=118.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in a related development, a U.S. appeals court panel heard the Trump administration's challenge to Judge Boasberg's order about using the wartime power to deport the migrants. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=120.0s)]
*  But one appeals court panel judge told administration lawyers, quote, Nazis got better treatment under the wartime power. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=131.0s)]
*  The Trump administration lawyers sharply refuted that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=139.0s)]
*  The wife of Vice President Vance is to visit Greenland this week. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=143.0s)]
*  Mrs. Vance will be joined by Trump administration officials on a trip that has seen us fraught. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=147.0s)]
*  President Trump has repeatedly said the U.S. will take over Greenland. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=152.0s)]
*  The world's largest island is rich in critical minerals. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=156.0s)]
*  But NPR's Deepa Sivaram says Greenland is a territory of Denmark. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=160.0s)]
*  In an interview with a Greenlandic newspaper over the weekend, the prime minister of Greenland said that the visit from members of the Trump administration was very aggressive. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=164.0s)]
*  He said that Greenland has to face the seriousness of the situation of the U.S. wanting to annex them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=172.0s)]
*  Now, Trump, for his part, says this isn't a provocation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=178.0s)]
*  He says it's a purely friendly visit and claimed that the U.S. was invited to visit Greenland, though NPR is not able to confirm if there was an invite. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=181.0s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaram reporting. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=189.0s)]
*  The DNA testing company 23andMe is seeking bankruptcy protection. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=192.0s)]
*  And Beers Joe Hernandez reports the move raises questions about the private data it has collected. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=196.0s)]
*  The biotech firm that allows users to spit in a tube and send away the sample for DNA analysis is seeking a buyer. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=202.0s)]
*  It comes a few months after the California company laid off roughly 40 percent of its staff and two years after a data breach affected millions of customer accounts. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=209.0s)]
*  Data privacy experts are now raising concerns about what could happen to the sensitive genetic information of 15 million users if 23andMe is sold. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=219.0s)]
*  The company says customers can still delete their data and close their accounts if they choose and has vowed to remain in operation through the bankruptcy process. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=228.0s)]
*  Joe Hernandez, NPR News. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=236.0s)]
*  In women's NCAA college basketball, the sweet 16 teams are set. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=239.0s)]
*  But the tournament was overshadowed last night when one of college basketball's biggest stars suffered an injury. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=244.0s)]
*  Greg Eklund explains. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=250.0s)]
*  Southern California sophomore Juju Watkins, a first-team All-American and this season's Big Ten Player of the Year, had to be carried off the floor in the first quarter of the Trojan second round game against Mississippi State. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=252.0s)]
*  Watkins was grabbing her right knee when she was down, which stirred up a reaction from her coach, Lindsey Gottlieb. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=265.0s)]
*  I mean, I'd be lying if I told you that I wasn't rattled, you know, seeing Juju on the floor and crying. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=272.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a human game. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=278.0s)]
*  Despite what the team describes as a season-ending injury to Watkins, USC rallied to build its lead and easily handled Mississippi State 96-59. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=280.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Greg Eklund. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=291.0s)]
*  I'm Korva Kuhlman, NPR News. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_XUeZjloIs&t=293.0s)]
