# Biden Blames Debate Performance On Travel Fatigue | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY)
*  Hurricane Barrel remains a dangerous category four storm as it continues to move toward Jamaica. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=0.0s)]
*  And a new law in Tennessee requires domestic violence suspects to wear GPS monitoring devices. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=5.8s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=12.4s)]
*  President Biden told supporters last night at a fundraiser he did not listen to his staff in the weeks ahead of last week's debate. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=16.9s)]
*  He had traveled abroad twice and NPR's Deepa Shivaram reports Biden joked that he nearly fell asleep [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=23.7s)]
*  on the debate stage. Biden was in McLean, Virginia, just outside Washington, attending a fundraiser where press are allowed inside but can't record audio or video. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=29.9s)]
*  Biden said he didn't get much sleep before the debate last week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=39.7s)]
*  In the weeks leading up to the debate, Biden traveled to France for the anniversary of D-Day and to Italy for the G7 summit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=43.3s)]
*  The audience laughed when Biden said he nearly fell asleep on the debate stage. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=49.9s)]
*  He said it wasn't an excuse, but it was an explanation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=53.8s)]
*  It's the most detailed Biden has gotten into semi publicly on his lackluster debate performance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=57.0s)]
*  Deepa Shivaram, NPR News, the White House. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=62.4s)]
*  Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says it is, quote, legitimate to ask whether Biden's poor performance at the debate was a one time issue or whether it was a, quote, condition. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=64.6s)]
*  She says she is supporting President Biden, but Pelosi urged him to sit down for interviews with serious journalists. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=74.9s)]
*  Biden will do that Friday with ABC. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=81.5s)]
*  He'll also hold a press conference next week during a NATO meeting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=83.9s)]
*  Hurricane Barrel continues to storm through the Caribbean Sea. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=87.8s)]
*  It's aimed directly at Jamaica. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=91.6s)]
*  Top sustained winds are at 145 miles per hour, and it's a Category 4 storm. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=93.9s)]
*  Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness notes Barrel was previously considered a Category 5 storm, the top category assigned by the National Hurricane Center. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=99.4s)]
*  It highlights the growing impact of climate change on global weather patterns, particularly on small island developing states like Jamaica. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=109.6s)]
*  Hurricane Barrel first made landfall on the Caribbean islands around Grenada. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  There are reports that six people there have been killed and that destruction is catastrophic. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=123.5s)]
*  The hurricane is expected to move toward Mexico later this week. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  A new Tennessee law requires suspects in domestic violence cases to wear a GPS monitoring device until their court date. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=134.0s)]
*  From member station WPLN, Rose Gilbert reports on the first such law in the nation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=142.3s)]
*  The law was named for Marie Varsos and her mother. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=148.1s)]
*  They were murdered by Marie's abusive husband after he was arrested and then almost immediately released for strangling her until she lost consciousness. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=151.0s)]
*  After being released, he tracked her down and waited outside for 45 minutes in a rental car stocked with zip ties and weapons before murdering Marie and his mother-in-law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=160.4s)]
*  Marie's brother Alex Yon has been advocating for this new GPS measure for more than two years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=170.1s)]
*  This is one of the most important bills that I feel like I could have actually saved my mother and sister. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=175.9s)]
*  The law received broad bipartisan support in the Tennessee legislature. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=182.4s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Rose Gilbert in Nashville. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=186.8s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoHeZVOV3FY&t=189.9s)]
