# White House Learned Of Austin's Prostate Cancer Tuesday | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w)
*  Former President Donald Trump plans to be back in court this week for the closing arguments in his New York civil fraud trial. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=0.0s)]
*  And Iowans will have to brave frigid temperatures if they plan to caucus next Monday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=11.16s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is making plans to return to court in New York this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=15.84s)]
*  That's after a federal appeals court in Washington expressed doubts about his claims of absolute immunity. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=20.16s)]
*  NPR's Carrie Johnson reports a ruling by the appeals court panel could come any time. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=26.08s)]
*  All three judges on the D.C. appeals court panel seem doubtful former president should enjoy a free pass from criminal charges for actions they took while in the White House. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=31.0s)]
*  The question is how broadly or narrowly the judges will rule and how much time Trump has to appeal to higher courts. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=40.92s)]
*  The former president and GOP front runner has been seeking to delay all four criminal cases against him, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=48.08s)]
*  trying to push those trials until after the next election. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=54.6s)]
*  Closing arguments are set for Thursday in Trump's civil fraud trial in New York. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  His spokesman says Trump plans to attend, making it his second court appearance in a week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=62.36s)]
*  Carrie Johnson, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=67.56s)]
*  The White House is directing cabinet secretaries to review their rules for delegating authority. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=69.76s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid explains the move comes after the defense secretary was hospitalized for several days before informing the president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=75.16s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized for complications following treatment for prostate cancer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=83.68s)]
*  The White House says Biden was informed of the cancer diagnosis just Tuesday morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  This, even though a statement from the hospital where he was treated, says the prostate cancer was identified in early December. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=95.04s)]
*  Here's the administration's national security spokesman, John Kirby. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  It is not optimal for a situation like this to go as long as it did without the commander in chief knowing about it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=105.76s)]
*  Kirby acknowledged this did not unfold the way it should have, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  but the White House insists Biden retains full confidence in the defense secretary. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Asma Khalid, NPR News. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=125.04s)]
*  Deadly winter weather continues to wallop the U.S. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  At least five people have been killed in several states. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=130.28s)]
*  Blizzards persist in the Pacific Northwest. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  These stretch from Washington and Oregon into Idaho. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=135.76s)]
*  There are also avalanche warnings in Idaho as well as in Montana. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=139.04s)]
*  Flooding is hitting the East Coast while the South picks up tornado damage. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  There are dangerously powerful winds in the Southwest. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=147.56s)]
*  The Central U.S. is seeing wind chill values below zero. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=150.6s)]
*  The wintry weather will create a cold snap over the next few days in the Central U.S. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=154.64s)]
*  That could affect voting next Monday in the Iowa caucuses. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=160.0s)]
*  National Weather Service meteorologist Chad Hahn says temperatures in Iowa will be frigid on Monday as people go to vote. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=164.16s)]
*  As of now, we have a high temperature of one degree on Monday, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=171.88s)]
*  though with fresh snowpack we're expecting those actually may be on the high side. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=176.88s)]
*  So we may not we may not warm above zero degrees on Monday. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=181.36s)]
*  That would set a temperature record for the Iowa caucuses. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=187.2s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeP7_eDbo8w&t=190.88s)]
