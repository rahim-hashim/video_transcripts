# Supreme Court To Hear Trump's Presidential Immunity Case | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ)
*  The Supreme Court hears arguments today on Donald Trump's claim that he is immune from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=0.0s)]
*  criminal prosecution for his acts while president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=4.12s)]
*  And a hearing that could determine the fate of a unionization campaign at an Amazon facility [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=7.5s)]
*  in Alabama starts today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=12.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=15.08s)]
*  I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=17.5s)]
*  The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments today on Donald Trump's claim that he's immune [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=19.44s)]
*  from criminal prosecution for acts he committed while president. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=24.5s)]
*  Namely, his effort to prevent Joe Biden from being officially declared the winner of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=28.76s)]
*  2020 election. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=33.56s)]
*  And here's Nina Totenberg has more. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=35.44s)]
*  Trump claims his actions while president are constitutionally protected official actions [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  and that the only way he could be prosecuted would be if he had been impeached, convicted, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  and removed from office first. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=47.160000000000004s)]
*  Trump contends that if presidents could be prosecuted for official actions after leaving [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=49.46s)]
*  office, they would be unable to discharge their presidential duties effectively and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=53.68s)]
*  that the presidency would be forever crippled. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=59.04s)]
*  But dozens of high ranking former Republican officeholders have filed a brief countering [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=62.04s)]
*  that you don't protect the presidency by immunizing someone who tries to steal it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=67.68s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump had thoughts on the hearing about whether he violated a gag order in his [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=75.6s)]
*  criminal hush money trial. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=80.4s)]
*  They take an institutional right away with a gag order. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=82.28s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=85.32s)]
*  It's election interference. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=86.32s)]
*  This whole thing is election interference. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=87.32s)]
*  He made those comments after chatting with construction workers in midtown Manhattan [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=90.24s)]
*  this morning ahead of the resumption of the hush money trial. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  Prosecutors say he willfully and blatantly violated the order that bars him from attacking [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=98.2s)]
*  jurors and witnesses, among others, saying he did so in comments outside the courtroom [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=102.4s)]
*  and also online. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=107.32s)]
*  Trump's lawyers say he's defending himself from what he calls political attacks. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=109.08s)]
*  A hearing gets underway today to determine if Amazon illegally interfered in a union [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=113.72s)]
*  election at one of its warehouses in Alabama more than two years ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=118.52s)]
*  Federal labor officials already ruled Amazon interfered in a prior election at that warehouse. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=123.0s)]
*  Steven Vasahov, the Gulf States Newsroom, reports the new hearing could result in a third election. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  Over the course of more than three years and two elections, Amazon fought back hard against [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=134.76s)]
*  a campaign to unionize this warehouse. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=138.96s)]
*  The union alleges Amazon required workers to attend anti-union meetings and threatened [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=141.46s)]
*  to close the warehouse if the union won. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=145.96s)]
*  An investigation by federal labor officials already found evidence to back up those claims. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=148.44s)]
*  Amazon is fired back and accuses the union of illegally interfering in the last election. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  The hearing will consider all of that, along with determining how workers actually voted. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  The results were too close to call, and hundreds of challenge ballots still need to be reviewed. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  The hearing is scheduled to last into July. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=167.56s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Stephen Vasahon, Birmingham, Alabama. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=170.08s)]
*  TikTok is threatening to sue over the new U.S. law that says the app's Chinese owners [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=173.28s)]
*  have to sell the company within a year or the app will be banned in the U.S., citing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=178.12s)]
*  U.S. national security concerns. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=182.6s)]
*  App owner ByteDance says the law is a violation of TikTok users' First Amendment rights, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=184.62s)]
*  calling it unconstitutional. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQviLAY5sQ&t=191.92000000000002s)]
