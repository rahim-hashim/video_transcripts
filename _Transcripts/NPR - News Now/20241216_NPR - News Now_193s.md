# ABC Settles Lawsuit With Trump For $15 Million | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ)
*  ABC News will pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit with President-elect Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And with tax credits facing an uncertain future, EV sales jumped by around 10 percent in November. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=5.36s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kori Fikulman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Israel says it's closing its embassy in Ireland because of what the Israeli foreign minister [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=16.4s)]
*  calls anti-Israel policies. Ireland is one of the most pro-Palestinian countries in Europe, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=20.64s)]
*  if not the world, as NPR's Lauren Freire reports. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=26.16s)]
*  Many Irish identify with the Palestinian cause relating it to their own history of occupation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=29.52s)]
*  by the British. Last spring, Ireland formally recognized a Palestinian state, and last week [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  it said it's joining a genocide case against Israel at the United Nations' top court. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=39.84s)]
*  Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar says he considers Ireland's actions anti-Semitic, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=44.56s)]
*  rooted in efforts to quote, de-legitimize and demonize the Jewish state. He says he's ordered [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  the closure of Israel's embassy in Dublin and will focus on relations with other countries instead. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=55.12s)]
*  Ireland's Taoiseach, or Prime Minister Simon Harris, calls the move deeply regrettable. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=60.4s)]
*  He says Ireland isn't anti-Israel, it's pro-peace, pro-human rights, and pro-international law, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=65.12s)]
*  he says. Lauren Freire, NPR News, London. ABC News and its parent company, Disney, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=71.12s)]
*  will pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit with President-elect Trump. Earlier this year, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=76.32s)]
*  ABC host George Stephanopoulos incorrectly asserted in an interview Trump had been found [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=82.4s)]
*  liable for rape. Last year, a New York jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse but not rape. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=87.68s)]
*  The judge said at the time what happened fit the commonly understood definition of rape, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  but not the narrow one under New York law. NPR's David Falkenfleck reports some expected [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=99.12s)]
*  Stephanopoulos and ABC to clarify the remarks at trial, but instead they settled. Well, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=104.72s)]
*  it remains a mystery why they didn't clarify, but why did they settle? They say they're happy [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=110.24s)]
*  to be past it. We don't know exactly, but this is a major amount of money, particularly for a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=113.92s)]
*  public figure. It also comes at a time as a number of news organizations and a number of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  owners and leaders of news organizations appear trying to make peace with Trump. You think of the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  killed endorsements of Vice President Harris in the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  NPR's David Falkenfleck reporting. Sales of electric vehicles went up by around 10% in November, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=133.52s)]
*  according to Cox Automotive, and NPR's Kamila Domenoski has more. EV sales have gone up, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=147.84s)]
*  but not spiked as much as you might think. Used EV dealer Alex Lawrence in Utah says that's because [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  for every shopper racing to snag these tax credits, there are still many, many, many, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=159.76s)]
*  many, many more people that don't even know this exists. The federal tax credits are worth up to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=164.64s)]
*  four grand for used cars and up to $7,500 for new vehicles, and buyers can get that discount up front [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=168.64s)]
*  at the time of purchase, even use it as a down payment. The future of the credit is uncertain. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  It would require an act of Congress to completely eliminate it, but the Trump administration could [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=180.16s)]
*  also just make it harder to get. Kamila Domenoski, NPR News. You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxxRvk5o9RQ&t=184.8s)]
