**NPR - News Now:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY)
*  The Senate continues to work on legislation to regulate artificial intelligence, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=0.0s)]
*  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging everyone six months [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=5.0s)]
*  and up to get the new COVID boosters. Good morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=8.76s)]
*  I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=11.64s)]
*  In Libya, 2,000 bodies have been recovered from the eastern port city of Durnah [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=15.68s)]
*  after heavy rains caused dams to burst, sending floodwaters into the town. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=20.6s)]
*  Officials say entire neighborhoods were washed away. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=25.2s)]
*  NPR's Ruth Sherlock has more. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=28.12s)]
*  With roads cut off, there was very little help getting to Durnah for the first 36 hours. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=29.92s)]
*  Now there are responders in the city. Faraj Alhassi of the Libyan Red Crescent, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=37.6s)]
*  he's in the organization's emergency response room. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=43.24s)]
*  And he told me they're being inundated with calls by people who are still stranded [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=46.68s)]
*  in the storm debris or trapped under rubble. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  And they're also looking at how to cope with all of those that have lost their homes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=54.0s)]
*  NPR's Ruth Sherlock reporting. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=58.72s)]
*  Libya is a country that's divided by two rival governments [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=60.68s)]
*  and has dealt with more than a decade of conflict. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=63.839999999999996s)]

*  as lawmakers scramble to keep up with the emerging technology. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=76.96s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says today's AI Insight Forum is the next step [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=80.6s)]
*  in the complicated process of regulating artificial intelligence. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=86.56s)]
*  It will affect just about every aspect of society in major ways, both positive and negative. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=91.12s)]
*  And on an issue this wide ranging and important, we must make every good faith effort to act. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=98.32s)]
*  Schumer says members of the Senate will be seeking input from tech pioneers, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=105.28s)]
*  including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=110.12s)]

*  on the vaccine's rollout. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=137.84s)]
*  In a statement, the CDC said that vaccinating everyone from six months and up [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=139.16s)]
*  with updated shots will protect against potentially serious outcomes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=143.84s)]

*  For people with health insurance, most plans will cover the COVID-19 vaccine at no cost. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=164.56s)]
*  People who don't have health insurance or who have health plans that do not cover the cost can get a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNx_Ax7OLuY&t=170.35999999999999s)]
