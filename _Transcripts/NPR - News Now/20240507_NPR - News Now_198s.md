# Hamas Agrees To Cease-Fire As Israeli Operation In Rafah Looms | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8)
*  Hamas made a surprise announcement Monday that it had accepted the terms of a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=0.0s)]
*  agreement with Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=6.24s)]
*  But there now appears to be some confusion over the deal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=8.14s)]
*  And President Biden is expected to deliver a speech today condemning anti-Semitism. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=11.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Developments surrounding ceasefire talks and a hostage release in Israel have been moving [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=23.72s)]
*  at lightning speed over the past day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=29.32s)]
*  NPR's Jackie Northam reports that's created a lot of mixed messages about the facts playing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=32.44s)]
*  out on the ground. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=38.64s)]
*  Given the sky-high stakes involved in the Gaza conflict, it's not unusual that Israel, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=40.4s)]
*  Hamas, the U.S., and others are not showing their hands. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=44.88s)]
*  That's created dueling narratives as developments unfold. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=48.6s)]
*  For example, Hamas made a surprise announcement Monday that it would accept a ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=52.0s)]
*  What prompted that depends on who you ask. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=57.6s)]
*  Was it an impending Israeli military operation against Hamas and Ra'a or was the militant [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=59.88s)]
*  group simply throwing the negotiating ball back in Israel's court? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=65.04s)]
*  Israel says it will continue negotiating but at the same time launch airstrikes in eastern [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Ra'a. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, a White House official says those strikes aren't the major military operation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=74.96000000000001s)]

*  police to clear out their encampment on school grounds last night. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=103.68s)]
*  Students toppled barriers that were set up outside of their encampment just hours after [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  that they could face immediate suspension. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  Graduate student Balthazar Dinesh says despite the threats, they plan to remain camped out [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=116.72s)]
*  until MIT meets their demands to cut any ties with Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=121.28s)]
*  From day one we came to the negotiating table with a written plan and a written proposal [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyElgWIzR8&t=125.52s)]
