*  red flag warnings about wind in the Los Angeles area. This warning is called a particularly [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfcqyYlWzY&t=20.0s)]

*  A new launch window has not been set yet. Teams attempted to launch the rocket last week, but [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfcqyYlWzY&t=207.04s)]
*  conditions at sea where the rocket was set to land on a barge forced the delays. With seven [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfcqyYlWzY&t=212.16s)]

*  Control and Prevention has yet to confirm this, and NPR's Amy Held reports health officials say [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfcqyYlWzY&t=240.96s)]
*  the risk to the public is low. The child in San Francisco, officials say, has recovered from [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfcqyYlWzY&t=246.4s)]

*  change is unknown. The more mammals infected, the more opportunity the virus has to mutate. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfcqyYlWzY&t=285.92s)]
