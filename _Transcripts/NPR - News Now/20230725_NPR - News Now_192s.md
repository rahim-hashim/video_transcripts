# Monday's Deadline Looms To Avoid A Strike At UPS | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo)
*  A new study connects the intense heat in the northern hemisphere with human-caused climate change. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=0.0s)]
*  And the deadline is looming to avoid a strike by more than half of the employees at UPS. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=5.68s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=11.36s)]
*  A new international study finds heat waves baking the northern hemisphere this summer [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  would be nearly impossible but for climate change. NPR's Nathan Rott says the scientists [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=20.64s)]
*  conclude things are worse because humans are making them worse. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=25.92s)]
*  It says that the recent heat waves in America and southern Europe, which have broken records [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=29.52s)]
*  and put tens of millions of people under heat advisories and warnings, would be, quote, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=33.84s)]
*  virtually impossible, end quote, without human-caused climate change. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  And that recent heat waves in China were made 50 times more likely because of it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  NPR's Nathan Rott reporting. President Biden is poised to sign a proclamation today honoring [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  Emmett Till. Today would have been his 82nd birthday. The black boy was kidnapped and lynched [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=53.36s)]
*  in 1955. The white men accused of murdering him were acquitted by an all-white jury. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=59.28s)]
*  The monument will also honor Till's mother, Mamie. It was she who insisted her son's casket be open [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=64.56s)]
*  at his funeral so the world could see how he had been tortured. A potential strike at package [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=70.48s)]
*  delivery company UPS is becoming more likely. A deadline is looming for a union contract to expire. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=76.08s)]
*  From member station WABE in Atlanta, Christopher Alston reports contract talks are set to resume [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=82.88s)]
*  today. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents over half of UPS's workforce. The [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=88.8s)]
*  Teamsters are calling for better pay, particularly for part-time employees, and improved working [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  conditions. Annual profits at UPS in the past two years are close to three times what they were [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=98.32s)]
*  before the pandemic. Both sides have made tentative agreements on some issues, but government [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=103.6s)]
*  intervention is possible if a deal isn't reached before July 31st. UPS recently announced plans to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=108.72s)]
*  train non-union employees to make deliveries if union workers walk, but UPS pilots say they will [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=114.8s)]
*  not cross picket lines and fly during a strike. For NPR News, I'm Christopher Alston in Atlanta. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  A jury has ordered anti-government extremist Ammon Bundy and his associates to pay more than [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=126.0s)]
*  50 million dollars to Idaho's largest hospital. It's in connection with armed protests at the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=131.84s)]
*  hospital last year that led to a security lockdown. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports Bundy was a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=138.0s)]
*  no-show at the trial that wrapped up last week. In a statement, St. Luke's Hospital says the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=144.56s)]
*  jury's decision brings accountability to Bundy and his associates who they say are still engaged [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=150.56s)]
*  in a campaign of intimidation, harassment, and disinformation directed at hospital leaders, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=155.84s)]
*  doctors, and medical staff. During a two-week civil trial here, attorneys said the militants [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=161.04s)]
*  tried to stage an armed takeover of the hospital. State social workers had hospitalized one of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=165.84s)]
*  Bundy's associates' malnourished grandsons. It's unclear how much, if any of the some 50 million [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=171.44s)]
*  in damages will ever get paid. Bundy is apparently continuing to be holed up at his home in a rural [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=177.44s)]
*  area outside Boise defying an arrest warrant. Kirk Siegler, NPR News, Boise. You're listening [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=183.12s)]
*  to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqmfg0RLqo&t=189.04s)]
