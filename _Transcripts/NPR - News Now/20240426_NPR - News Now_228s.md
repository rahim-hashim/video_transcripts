# Student Protests Over The War In Gaza Continue To Grow | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw)
*  Constructions underway for a maritime pier that will help deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=0.0s)]
*  And a majority of the conservative Supreme Court justices have signaled some support for Donald Trump's push for presidential immunity. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=13.3s)]
*  The Pentagon says U.S. troops have started construction of a maritime pier off the coast of Gaza, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=17.6s)]
*  intended to improve the delivery of humanitarian aid. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=23.8s)]
*  NPR's Peter Kenyon reports aid groups are voicing concern about their safety while operating in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=27.6s)]
*  Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick S. Ryder told reporters the pier construction is underway. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=33.6s)]
*  President Joe Biden has reportedly instructed American forces not to set foot in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=39.2s)]
*  The Israeli military issued a statement saying it would provide security and logistics support for the aid effort, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  including naval and air force protection for U.S. troops working on the pier. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=50.0s)]
*  Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development and other aid groups have voiced concerns about working in Gaza, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  especially since the deaths of seven World Central Kitchen employees in an Israeli airstrike earlier this month. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Jerusalem. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=66.4s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing today, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=68.9s)]
*  raising concerns over many issues, including China's support for the Russian military in its war with Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=74.0s)]
*  Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=80.0s)]
*  As we told China for some time, ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=88.0s)]
*  In our discussion today, I made clear that if China does not address this problem, we will. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=93.5s)]
*  Blinken is wrapping up a three-day trip to China. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=100.2s)]
*  Not much is expected in progress on core issues because both sides remain at a standstill on key issues, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=102.9s)]
*  including trade and territorial conflicts in the South China Sea over Taiwan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=108.6s)]
*  More than 500 people have been arrested at pro-Palestinian protests at colleges and universities around the country, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=113.8s)]
*  including on the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=120.8s)]
*  Protesters are demanding an end to the Israel-Hamas war and in some cases asking their school to cut ties with Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  At Columbia University in New York, more than 100 were arrested as police tried to clear out an encampment, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=134.8s)]
*  but the school is still in negotiations with protesters to remove the tents, this after giving them several deadlines that were not met. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, protests at the University of Southern California, or USC, resulted in 93 arrests this week, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=149.1s)]
*  and now the school says it will cancel its main commencement ceremony scheduled for May 10th, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=154.8s)]
*  citing new safety measures put in place after the protests started. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=160.4s)]
*  In some places, protests were peaceful, including Northeastern University in Boston, even though there was a strong police presence there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=164.0s)]
*  Conservative justices on the Supreme Court signaled their support for the notion that Donald Trump is immune from prosecution [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=171.4s)]
*  for official acts committed as president. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=178.7s)]
*  And here's Nina Totenberg has more. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=181.2s)]
*  Five of the court's six conservative justices seem prepared at minimum to send the Trump election obstruction case back to the trial judge [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=183.0s)]
*  with instructions to determine which of the charges against him involve private acts for which he can be prosecuted. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=191.6s)]
*  That would ensure that no trial would take place before the November election, and where Trump elected, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=199.0s)]
*  he could order the Justice Department to dismiss the charges. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=204.9s)]
*  The only conservative justice to express skepticism about the breadth of Trump's claim to immunity from prosecution [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  was the last of his own appointees to the court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC3rE2vxpzw&t=221.1s)]
