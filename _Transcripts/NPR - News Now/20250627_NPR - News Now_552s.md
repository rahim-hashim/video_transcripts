# Justices Knock Nationwide Injunctions In Birthright Citizenship Case | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0)
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that judges lack authority to issue nationwide injunctions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=0.0s)]
*  in a case stemming from President Trump's order on birthright citizenship. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  And a Minnesota lawmaker will lie in state today at the Minnesota State Capitol. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=10.9s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm Windsor Johnston from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=16.28s)]
*  The U.S. Supreme Court has handed President Trump a major victory in his effort to end [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=20.86s)]
*  birthright citizenship. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=27.12s)]
*  In a 6-3 decision, the justices ruled that the federal courts lack broad authority to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=29.12s)]
*  grant nationwide injunctions but did not weigh in on the constitutional merits of Trump's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=34.92s)]
*  executive order to end birthright citizenship. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=40.92s)]
*  Amanda Frost, a legal scholar at the University of Virginia, spoke to NPR shortly after the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  ruling was handed down this morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=50.28s)]
*  As a result of this decision, now while individual plaintiffs could win relief, each and every [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=52.64s)]
*  person affected would have to sue in order to get relief. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=57.88s)]
*  And in other words, an administration that's violating the law could lose a case and yet, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  nonetheless, apply the policy across the nation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=66.12s)]
*  Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship aims to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=69.72s)]
*  of people living in the country without legal status. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  In a separate case, the Supreme Court upheld the provision of the Affordable Care Act that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  provided free, preventive care for millions of Americans. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=85.16s)]
*  The vote was 6-3, with Chief Justice John Roberts and justices Amy Coney Barrett and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=89.44s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh joining the court's three liberals in the majority. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=95.4s)]
*  President Trump is turning up the pressure on congressional Republicans to vote for his [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=100.16s)]
*  massive tax cut and spending bill. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=104.56s)]
*  Trump held an event at the White House last night to urge the Senate to pass the bill. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Claudia Grisales reports Senate Republicans are struggling to take up the legislation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=112.6s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader John Thune privately told his GOP conference that he does not currently [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  have the 50 votes needed to pass the massive spending package, according to a source granted [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=124.0s)]
*  anonymity to discuss the details of a private meeting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=129.56s)]
*  The update came after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian told Republicans that several [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=133.6s)]
*  key tax provisions have to be removed from the bill. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=139.12s)]
*  That marks a major blow to Republican efforts to cut spending to pay for the plan. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=143.04s)]
*  It carries the bulk of President Trump's domestic agenda. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=148.44s)]
*  Trump has pushed congressional Republicans to get the legislation to his desk by the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=152.08s)]
*  Fourth of July holiday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=155.36s)]
*  Claudia Grisales, NPR News, The Capitol. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=157.56s)]
*  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill appear divided on the Pentagon's latest assessment of recent [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=161.28s)]
*  U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=166.88s)]
*  Members of the Senate were briefed by the Trump administration on Thursday. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=171.12s)]
*  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says there was no coherent strategy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=175.32s)]
*  No end game, no plan, no specific, no detailed plan on how Iran does not attain a nuclear [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=180.0s)]
*  weapon. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=188.6s)]
*  Republican Senator Ron Johnson defended President Trump's decision to attack Iran. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=189.6s)]
*  I for one am comforted by having a president who is decisive, who took action to protect [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=195.04s)]
*  America, to protect our ally Israel, and at least for a while take away the threat of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=200.44s)]
*  a nuclear Iran. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=210.68s)]
*  Members of the House are scheduled to receive a briefing later today. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=212.56s)]
*  Both the Pentagon and the White House have praised the airstrikes, calling them historically [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=216.6s)]
*  successful. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=221.76s)]
*  The number of people detained by immigration and customs enforcement has been rapidly increasing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=223.64s)]
*  NPR's Meg Anderson reports the Trump administration has now surpassed its previous high, which [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  was reached during his first term in 2019. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=236.64s)]
*  On average, more than 55,000 people are now held in ICE custody every day, according to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=240.26s)]
*  data from the administration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=246.04s)]
*  Historical data collected by The Marshall Project suggests that number met just this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  month is the highest ever recorded. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=252.62s)]
*  What's more, it is nearly 15,000 more people than what ICE is currently funded for. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  Immigration experts say a big driver of the growth in how many people are detained comes [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=261.82s)]
*  from a shift in priorities. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=266.3s)]
*  The Trump administration is arresting more people who haven't committed any crimes beyond [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  their civil immigration violation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=272.58s)]
*  Nearly three out of four people currently in ICE custody have no criminal record, and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  includes minor offenses like traffic violations. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=279.74s)]
*  Meg Anderson, NPR News. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=283.1s)]
*  The United States says it's stepping up its food program in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=285.74s)]
*  NPR's Aya Batraoui reports law and order has been crumbling inside the territory where [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=290.5s)]
*  gangs have been attacking UN AIN cowboys. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=296.22s)]
*  What we're seeing is even more clans now clashing with Hamas security forces who are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=299.06s)]
*  trying to crack down on this and the price gouging that's happening from these stolen [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=303.1s)]
*  goods. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  One of these clans raided Nasser Hospital yesterday. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=307.58s)]
*  They opened fire inside. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=309.7s)]
*  And what we're seeing is chaos and breakdown of order happening after more than 20 months [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=310.7s)]
*  of war and expanding as Hamas is losing its grip on the territory. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=315.26s)]
*  That's NPR's Aya Batraoui reporting. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=318.74s)]
*  Even if everyone in the country who was eligible to vote did so in the 2024 election, President [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=321.68s)]
*  Trump still would have won. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=327.9s)]
*  NPR's Domenico Montanaro has more on a study conducted by the Pew Research Center after [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=330.14s)]
*  the election. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  Historically higher turnout was thought to be better for Democrats because younger voters [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  and non-white voters lean left and they traditionally vote at lower rates. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=341.06s)]
*  But of the thousands of people that Pew interviewed who didn't vote in the 2024 presidential election, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=345.32s)]
*  44% said they preferred Trump while 40% said they would have rather seen Democrat Kamala [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  Harris in the White House. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=355.18s)]
*  So even if everyone who could have voted did, Trump's overall very narrow popular vote win [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=356.74s)]
*  would have expanded from 1.5 percentage points to 3. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=360.92s)]
*  That's a reversal from the last two presidential elections when non-voters said they preferred [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=365.1s)]
*  the Democratic candidates. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=369.1s)]
*  The finding was part of an almost 9,000-person Pew survey conducted in the weeks after the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=370.84000000000003s)]

*  Slavik explained to the jury that in order to convict Combs of sex trafficking, they [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0UMUsTQzy0&t=458.86s)]
