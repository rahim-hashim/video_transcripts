# Supreme Court To Hear Arguments Dealing With Opioid Crisis | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo)
*  The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments today on a controversial opioid crisis settlement, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=0.0s)]
*  and the Israeli army is demanding that Palestinians move out of another Gaza neighborhood. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=4.88s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=9.84s)]
*  At the U.S. Supreme Court today, the justices will hear arguments dealing with the opioid crisis. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=14.32s)]
*  NPR's Nina Totenberg reports the issue involves the $6 billion bankruptcy settlement [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=19.36s)]
*  that frees the Sackler family from further liability. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=24.2s)]
*  The Sackler family has been intimately involved in everything that Purdue Pharma did [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=27.48s)]
*  to aggressively and deceptively market the painkiller OxyContin. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=32.12s)]
*  All three of the Sackler brothers who bought Purdue and ultimately developed OxyContin were doctors, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=36.84s)]
*  and six Sacklers sat on the company board, including the chairman, Richard Sackler, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=41.96s)]
*  who closely directed the company's deceitful marketing strategy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=46.44s)]
*  But when the OxyContin scandal blew up and the company pled guilty to three criminal charges, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=50.84s)]
*  only the company filed for bankruptcy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=56.6s)]
*  The Sacklers contributed $6 billion in exchange for being released from any further liability. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=59.08s)]
*  But because they did not file for bankruptcy, they were allowed to keep more than half of their wealth. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  The question today is whether the bankruptcy court had the authority to approve such a release [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=70.28s)]
*  for the Sacklers from future lawsuits. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=75.48s)]
*  There's been more fighting in Gaza between the Israeli military and Hamas militants. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=80.68s)]
*  The Israeli military is warning Palestinian civilians to move out of a neighborhood in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=85.56s)]
*  southern Gaza. Tens of thousands of Palestinians had fled there after the Israeli military told [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=89.88s)]
*  them to evacuate northern Gaza for safety. Israel is now bombing certain neighborhoods [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  in southern Gaza. NPR's Brian Mann says shelters are overcrowded and many Palestinians are falling sick. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=100.76s)]
*  The World Health Organization is really worried about this. They've documented more than 35,000 [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=107.56s)]
*  cases of diarrhea among very young children under the age of five. There's a huge spike of cases [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=111.88s)]
*  of severe respiratory illness. And for the two plus million Palestinians there, it's just difficult [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=117.8s)]
*  now to find clean drinking water and hygiene is nearly impossible. And for now, there's really no [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=123.16s)]
*  relief in sight. NPR's Brian Mann reporting. Last week, the U.S. government reported the country's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=128.6s)]
*  gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.2% in the third quarter of this year. But Steve [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=134.2s)]
*  Beckner reports a November survey from the National Association for Business Economics [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=141.08s)]
*  shows a less robust outlook for next year. The business economists remain fairly optimistic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  Three-fourths of them put low odds on the economy going into a recession as the Federal Reserve [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=152.28s)]
*  fights inflation with high interest rates. But they do forecast growth will slow to 1% in the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=157.96s)]
*  coming year. NABE President Ellen Zintner says members expect a higher unemployment rate, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=164.68s)]
*  but that most believe it will stay below 5%. The economists expect less inflation, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=171.24s)]
*  but doubt it will fall to the Fed's 2% target. Nonetheless, they think the central bank will [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=177.4s)]
*  start cutting interest rates in the new year. For NPR News, I'm Steve Beckner. This is NPR. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5A1M5pIHWo&t=183.16000000000003s)]
