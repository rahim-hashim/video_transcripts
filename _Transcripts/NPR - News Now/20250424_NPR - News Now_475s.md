# Russia Attacks Kyiv After Zelenskyy Refuses To Accept Losses | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0)
*  Russia launched another deadly attack on Kiev overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=0.0s)]
*  And India's prime minister is promising to find and punish the attackers who killed 26 people this week. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=3.44s)]
*  Most of the victims were Hindu men. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=9.36s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=11.76s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=14.32s)]
*  Russia has launched deadly strikes on Ukraine's capital, Kiev, overnight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=16.32s)]
*  This came after the Trump administration pushed a plan to end Russia's war on Ukraine. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  The plan sharply favors the Kremlin. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=25.36s)]
*  NPR's Joanna Kokissus reports from Kiev that drones and missiles rained down on the city overnight, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=28.0s)]
*  killing at least nine people and wounding 70 more. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=33.36s)]
*  I recorded these explosions overnight as Ukrainian air defense tried to shoot down a buzzing drone flying over our neighborhood. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=38.88s)]
*  The Ukrainian military says Russia launched 215 drones and missiles at Ukraine, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=47.44s)]
*  most aimed at Kiev, in one of the deadliest strikes on the capital. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  In a video post on social media, Kiev mayor Vitaly Klitschko said rescue workers were digging survivors out with their bare hands. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Once again, we are seeing the face of Russian peace, he said, with sarcasm. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=67.84s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he's cutting short a trip to South Africa to return to Kiev. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=72.8s)]
*  Joanna Kokissus, NPR News, Kiev. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=78.8s)]
*  President Trump has issued a rare rebuke of Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=81.92s)]
*  Writing online, Trump says he's not happy with Russia's overnight drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's capital, Kiev. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=86.32s)]
*  Trump says, quote, Vladimir, stop. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=92.64s)]
*  Trump goes on to say, let's get the peace deal done. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  President Trump says he is going to work toward a fair trade deal with China. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=98.64s)]
*  This comes as the U.S. and China have slapped steep tariffs on each other's exports. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=102.8s)]
*  It's rattled stock market investors, but NPR's Asma Khalid explains why Trump may be hinting at a change. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  There's really two main reasons for the shift. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  This tariff rate, you know, if they remain in place, they would virtually bring trade between China and the U.S. to a halt. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=116.72s)]
*  But this is also fundamentally about the stock market and the economic uncertainty that Trump's tariffs have created. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump initially acknowledged that there could be some sort of short term economic pain, but that it would be worth it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=129.2s)]
*  And now you hear his team boasting that they're striking deals, that they're in conversation with some 90 countries. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=135.84s)]
*  NPR's Asma Khalid reporting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=142.24s)]
*  However, Beijing is rejecting any talk of a trade deal between China and the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=144.24s)]
*  Chinese officials say that any report of trade talks between the countries is false. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=150.24s)]
*  A dozen states are suing to try to block President Trump's global tariffs, alleging these are illegal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=155.44s)]
*  From member station KJZZ, Cameron Sanchez reports a coalition of Democratic attorneys general has filed a lawsuit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=161.12s)]
*  The 12 attorneys general argue that Congress, not the president, holds the power to impose tariffs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  The suit notes that in emergencies, the president has the power to create tariffs, but says that Trump is overstepping his bounds and illegally declaring tariffs at his whim. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=172.96s)]
*  The lawsuit is co-led by Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=181.68s)]
*  We are facing an unprecedented and lawless presidency, one that has made a habit over the last three months of disregarding the separation of powers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=184.96s)]
*  And ignoring the two other co-equal branches of government. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=198.0s)]
*  The attorneys general are specifically challenging four of Trump's executive orders and argue the tariffs will leave Americans shouldering high costs. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=202.4s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Cameron Sanchez in Phoenix. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=209.92s)]
*  Officials at the Vatican have kept the doors open all night at St. Peter's Basilica. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=212.96s)]
*  That was to allow about 50,000 mourners to pass the body of Pope Francis in the first 24 hours of viewing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=217.84s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from Rome the Basilica is still open. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=225.12s)]
*  Amid higher than expected turnout, the Vatican closed St. Peter's only for about an hour, around 6 a.m. local time, for cleaning. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  Among those joining the shuffling, hushed line up the Basilica's main aisle is Martine Jabi, who traveled from France. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  Just to say goodbye and we know he will see the Father, he will see God. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=244.72s)]
*  Some waited more than five hours to see the Pope's body in a red velvet lined simple wood coffin. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=251.68s)]
*  Francis died of a stroke Monday, aged 88. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=257.92s)]
*  After Saturday's funeral attended by world leaders, the Pope will be buried outside the Vatican in a break with tradition at the Basilica of St. Mary Major in an immigrant area. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=261.2s)]
*  Lauren Freyer and PR News, Rome. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=272.0s)]
*  India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi says his country will find the attackers who killed 26 people this week. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=274.4s)]
*  Most victims were Hindu men. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=280.88s)]
*  NPR's Dia Hadid reports from Mumbai Indian officials are blaming Pakistan, which denies responsibility. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=282.88s)]
*  Modi said India would find and punish, quote, every terrorist, their handlers, their backers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=289.04s)]
*  The attack outraged many Indians, not just for the scale of the killing, but the context. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=295.76s)]
*  Gunmen attacked tourists in a meadow, turning a scenic attraction into a killing field. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=302.4s)]
*  They targeted men. Eyewitnesses told local media that gunmen asked if they were Muslims before killing them. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  The group, which claim responsibility for the attack, is seen as a proxy for the Pakistani military. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=314.08s)]
*  On Wednesday, India said it was suspending its decades-old water treaty with Pakistan. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  Pakistani officials say the attack was a pretext by India to deny the country water. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  Dia Hadid, NPR News, Mumbai. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  A federal judge in Vermont has begun hearings on the detention of a Columbia University student by federal immigration authorities. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=333.44s)]
*  The Trump administration wants to deport Mohsen Madhawi for his pro-Palestinian activism. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=341.6s)]
*  NPR's Adrian Florido reports immigration agents arrested Madhawi last week when he showed up for his U.S. citizenship test. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  Mohsen Madhawi was in the courtroom as his lawyers asked that he be granted bail. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=356.24s)]
*  They argue the government is trying to deport him solely for his political activism, a violation of his First Amendment right to free speech. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=360.72s)]
*  Lawyer Cyrus Mehta read a statement from Madhawi outside the Burlington courthouse. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=367.68s)]
*  I don't want people to lose hope, stay positive, and believe in the inevitability of justice. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=372.16s)]
*  Government lawyers want Madhawi to remain in ICE custody in Vermont. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=381.04s)]
*  The judge gave them a few days to file papers explaining why. He'll hold a second hearing next week. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=385.2s)]
*  Adrian Florido, NPR News. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=390.96s)]
*  The retrial of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein resumes today in New York. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=392.96s)]
*  He is accused of sexually abusing three women. His earlier conviction was overturned by New York's highest court. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=398.24s)]
*  Weinstein's lead attorney Arthur Idalla says the accusers are manipulative. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=405.28s)]
*  I think that the truth is there was some serious relationships that Mr. Weinstein had with these people that were consensual. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=410.56s)]
*  Prosecutors sharply disagree. So does Lindsay Goldbroom, the lawyer for one of the women. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=419.84s)]
*  She says Weinstein's lawyer statements are offensive. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=425.76s)]
*  And we're just simply mischaracterizations and outright mistruths as it is connected to the lives and the experiences of these women. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=429.28s)]
*  Separately, Weinstein has been convicted of rape and sexual misconduct in California. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=440.64s)]

*  Jelly Roll, a Nashville native, has spoken candidly about his criminal record and his rehabilitation. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=457.76s)]
*  Jelly Roll often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before he goes to perform concerts. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrWLZ4jFhG0&t=463.84000000000003s)]
