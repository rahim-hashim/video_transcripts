*  these are expected to be announced later this week. Before leaving Washington for a campaign swing through California President Biden told [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=26.0s)]
*  reporters that he will not discuss details about the new sanctions until after they are unveiled. We'll have a major package announced on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=33.2s)]
*  Friday. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says the sanctions will be aimed at holding Russia accountable for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=40.84s)]
*  Navalny's death. And quite frankly for all its actions over the course of this vicious and brutal war that has now raged on for two [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=47.879999999999995s)]

*  borrowed $12,000 or less in federal student loans. In an interview with NPR education secretary Miguel Cardona said this round of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=93.68s)]
*  relief targets low income borrowers. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=101.44s)]
*  I believe the benefits of our borrowers who are falling into default being able to get back on their feet and contribute to the economy [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=104.2s)]
*  will help our country move forward. And without question, this is also contributing to the growth of communities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=111.12s)]

*  A federal magistrate judge has ordered the release of an FBI informant. Prosecutors say Alexander Smirnov has lied about an [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=122.56s)]
*  alleged scheme involving President Biden and his son Hunter. They allege he lied to the FBI. They also claim Smirnov has extensive [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=130.28s)]
*  ties to Russian intelligence. And prosecutors say that Smirnov says people tied to Russian intelligence were involved in passing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=138.68s)]
*  along a story about Hunter Biden. The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=146.8s)]
*  law. The decision comes from a case involving the IVF process where people can freeze embryos until choosing to implant them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=154.4s)]
*  Mary Ziegler is a law professor at the University of California, Davis. She says the ruling is bound to deeply affect people who [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=162.36s)]
*  want to use this method for pregnancy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=169.8s)]
*  Well, if embryos are persons under this ruling, that could have pretty profound downstream complications for how IVF has [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=172.28s)]
*  performed. So in IVF, generally more embryos are created than are implanted. They're stored. Sometimes they're donated or destroyed, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=179.0s)]
*  depending on the wishes of the people pursuing IVF. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=187.32s)]

*  From member station KCUR, Peggy Lowe reports the shooting killed one person and wounded at least 22 others. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=197.52s)]
*  Jackson County prosecutor Gene Peters Baker announced homicide charges against two adult men in the shooting during the Chief's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=204.6s)]

*  charges in the death of Lisa Lopez Galvin. Baker promised more arrests. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=218.32s)]
*  We seek to hold every shooter accountable for their actions on that day. Every single one. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=223.12s)]
*  Both men are still hospitalized with wounds received during the shooting. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=231.56s)]
*  Baker says the men didn't seem to know each other, but had a verbal argument and quickly pulled guns. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ih4RGq7gSc&t=235.0s)]
