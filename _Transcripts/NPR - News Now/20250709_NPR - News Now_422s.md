# The IRS Says Churches Can Now Endorse Political Candidates | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0)
*  President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to meet in Washington yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=0.0s)]
*  And the IRS now says that religious groups can endorse political candidates. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Kristen Wright from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=11.0s)]
*  In Texas, it is day six of the massive search for flood victims. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=15.0s)]
*  Authorities do say no one has been found alive since Friday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=19.0s)]
*  Robert Brake is searching for his parents. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=23.0s)]
*  They got washed away in their cabin Friday morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=25.0s)]
*  And we came down to help in the search efforts. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=29.0s)]
*  Maybe not be able to find my parents under this tragedy, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=32.0s)]
*  but maybe we can help somebody else find theirs and have some closure and peace. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=35.0s)]
*  Governor Abbott says at least 109 people died in the floods. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=39.0s)]
*  161 are still missing in the Kerr County area, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=43.0s)]
*  including five children and a counselor from the all-girl summer camp Camp Mystic. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=47.0s)]
*  The Associated Press reports state inspectors approved Camp Mystic's emergency plan [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=52.0s)]
*  two days before last Friday's flash floods. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=57.0s)]
*  The camp said Monday it lost 27 campers and counselors. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=60.0s)]
*  President Trump and the First Lady plan to travel to Texas Friday. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=64.0s)]
*  New Mexico's governor has declared a state of emergency [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=68.0s)]
*  after the city of Riedoso was hit by devastating flash flooding. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=72.0s)]
*  NPR's Ryland Barton reports three people were killed, two of them are young children. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=76.0s)]
*  The flash flooding began Tuesday afternoon when heavy rain fell on burned areas from last year's wildfires. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=81.0s)]
*  Emergency crews conducted over 50 swift water rescues. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=87.0s)]
*  Governor Lujan Grisham said the state is mobilizing every resource it has and will need federal support. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=91.0s)]
*  She added that Riedoso deserves the same urgent response as Texas received [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=96.0s)]
*  for its devastating flooding that killed over 100 people last week. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=101.0s)]
*  Ryland Barton, NPR News. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=105.0s)]
*  President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been meeting in Washington this week. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=107.0s)]
*  The U.S. is pushing for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=113.0s)]
*  NPR's Tamara Keith reports on what a deal between Israel and Hamas may include. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=117.0s)]
*  During a Cabinet meeting yesterday, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said he is hopeful that by the end of the week [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=123.0s)]
*  there will be an agreement with 10 live hostages released as well as nine deceased. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=129.0s)]
*  Witkoff says he thinks this will lead to a lasting peace in Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=135.0s)]
*  It's still unclear if Hamas and Israel will agree to the final terms. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=140.0s)]
*  The war in Gaza is in its second year. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=144.0s)]
*  In a departure from decades of precedent, the IRS says religious groups may endorse political candidates. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=148.0s)]
*  Details now from Jack Jenkins of Religion News Service. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=155.0s)]
*  Since 1954, a provision of the federal tax code has barred houses of worship from endorsing candidates. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=158.0s)]
*  Any that did so risk losing their tax-exempt status. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=165.0s)]
*  But this week, the IRS told two Texas churches and an association of Christian broadcasters [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=169.0s)]
*  that endorsements delivered to a congregation are just fine. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=175.0s)]
*  The agency likened it to, quote, a family discussion concerning candidates. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=179.0s)]
*  President Trump has long said he wants to rescind the policy known as the, quote, Johnson Amendment. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=184.0s)]
*  Polls have found that no major religious group approves of letting faith leaders endorse from the pulpit. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=190.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Jack Jenkins in Washington. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=196.0s)]
*  The State Department is investigating a number of cyber security threats, including a fake Signal account [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=199.0s)]
*  impersonating Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=206.0s)]
*  He's the latest high-level Trump administration official to be targeted after a similar incident earlier this year [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=209.0s)]
*  involving the White House chief of staff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=215.0s)]

*  purporting to be from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=229.0s)]
*  State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce says the Department is addressing the matter. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=232.0s)]
*  The Department takes seriously its responsibility to safeguard its information [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=237.0s)]
*  and continuously takes steps to improve the Department's cyber security posture to prevent future incidents. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=241.0s)]
*  The Department is also looking into a Russian-linked phishing campaign that was using fake State Department emails. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=248.0s)]
*  Michelle Kellerman, NPR News, The State Department. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=255.0s)]

*  The new policy takes effect now at domestic airports and applies to most people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=263.0s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says ending the shoe removal policy will streamline the security checkpoint process [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=267.0s)]
*  and shorten wait times. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=274.0s)]
*  Passengers will still pass through multiple layers of screening. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=276.0s)]
*  They'll also go through identity verification, and in fact TSA has recently experienced some fantastic success [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=279.0s)]
*  with implementing Real ID. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=286.0s)]

*  The unsigned order did not list how all nine justices voted, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=310.0s)]
*  but it included a dissent from Justice Katanji Brown Jackson and a concurrence from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=314.0s)]
*  who argued that lower courts could still address whether Trump's plan was constitutional. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=320.0s)]
*  The White House is treating the decision as a win, saying in a statement that it's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=326.0s)]
*  quote, another definitive victory for the president. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsz7oB66nf0&t=330.0s)]
