# Employers Add 209,000 Jobs In June As Unemployment Falls To 3.6% | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso)
*  The Labor Department reports hiring eased slightly in June as employers added 209,000 jobs and unemployment fell to 3.6 percent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=0.0s)]
*  And the FDA has fully approved the first drug shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=9.6s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Louise Schiavone with NPR News and these are the top stories. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=16.2s)]
*  The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in June, slightly lower than forecast by analysts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=21.1s)]
*  The Labor Department reports the nation's jobless rate fell to 3.6 percent. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=27.7s)]
*  We get details from NPR's Scott Horsley. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=32.5s)]
*  Employers continue to add jobs in health care, business services and construction. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=35.1s)]
*  But there's some weakness in other industries. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=39.6s)]
*  Retailers cut jobs last month and factory employment was relatively flat. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=41.5s)]
*  Job gains for April and May were also revised down by a total of 110,000 jobs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=45.6s)]
*  The unemployment rate, which is calculated from a different survey, inched down in June to 3.6 percent. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=50.9s)]
*  Competition for workers remains relatively strong. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=56.5s)]
*  Annual wage gains accelerated in June to 4.4 percent. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=59.4s)]
*  Wages are now rising faster than prices, giving workers increased buying power. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  That's likely to worry the Federal Reserve, though, which is expected to raise interest rates again this month as part of its long running effort to curb inflation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=67.9s)]
*  Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=75.3s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is visiting China. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=77.7s)]
*  She met with Premier Li Qiong. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=80.8s)]
*  It's another effort by the Biden administration to stabilize U.S.-China relations. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=83.0s)]
*  Yellen says the two nations should not allow disagreements to lead to misunderstandings that fray relations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=88.2s)]
*  Meeting with Premier Li, Yellen said the U.S. is seeking a competition with China that is healthy, not winner-take-all. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=95.5s)]
*  The first Alzheimer's drug shown to slow down the disease is now fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=103.1s)]
*  NPR's John Hamilton reports that the move will bring wider coverage for Medicare patients. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=110.1s)]
*  The drug, called leukemba, received conditional approval from the FDA in January. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=115.8s)]
*  But the Federal Medicare health insurance program decided to wait until the drug got full approval before covering it for most patients. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Leukemba removes a substance called amyloid from the brain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=127.3s)]
*  Studies show it slows the loss of memory and thinking by about 27 percent in people in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=130.5s)]
*  But it also can cause dangerous side effects like swelling and bleeding in the brain. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=137.5s)]
*  A million or more Medicare patients are potential candidates for leukemba. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=142.3s)]
*  The drug costs about $26,500 a year. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=146.0s)]
*  John Hamilton, NPR News. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=149.9s)]
*  The head of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog says that Japan's controversial plan to release treated radioactive water into the ocean is safe. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=152.4s)]
*  International Atomic Energy Agency Chief Rafael Grossi spoke to reporters today. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  Grossi toured the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant earlier in the week. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=167.7s)]
*  Grossi says the challenge now is to convince skeptics. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=172.89999999999998s)]
*  Some people may never, never accept this or may always harbor suspicion, skepticism. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=176.7s)]
*  This is logical. It's human nature. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=187.7s)]
*  Japan plans to release the water sometime this summer. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=189.9s)]
*  This is NPR News in Washington. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MHwy_hHsso&t=193.4s)]
