# U.S. Officials Hopeful Crossing Will Open For Aid To Gaza | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, October 16th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=0.0s)]
*  NPR has learned President Biden is delaying a trip to Colorado that he had planned for today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=6.4s)]
*  Instead, Biden will remain at the White House to participate in national security meetings [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=11.6s)]
*  as the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants continues. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=16.4s)]
*  There's still no word on the status of the border crossing in southern Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=19.6s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said yesterday that it would open [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=23.8s)]
*  to allow humanitarian relief aid to reach Palestinians and to let Americans trapped in Gaza get out into Egypt. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=27.4s)]
*  White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  Part of the reason was Hamas was putting up roadblocks and refusing to let people even approach the gate. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=37.2s)]
*  So again, we're going to work on this very, very hard with both Israel and Egypt. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=43.2s)]
*  We want to see safe passage for people that want to get out. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  He spoke to Weekend All Things Considered. It's not clear that the crossing has yet opened. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Secretary Blinken is back in Israel today for meetings with leaders. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=55.2s)]
*  The head of the World Health Organization says Gaza is suffering from a quote, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  humanitarian and public health catastrophe. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=63.2s)]
*  NPR's Ari Daniel reports this comes amid Israel's continuing response to Hamas militants who attacked more than a week ago. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=66.0s)]
*  Hospitals across Gaza are overwhelmed with the increasing number of patients [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  needing urgent treatment for injuries caused by Israel's ongoing bombardment. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=78.0s)]
*  Dr. Hassan Abu Sitta is a plastic surgeon usually based in London. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=83.2s)]
*  For the last week, he's been at Alaudah Hospital in Gaza. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=87.8s)]
*  There are patients on mattresses on the floors everywhere. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=91.0s)]
*  And there are over 200 patients who need to go to the operating room and can't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=95.0s)]
*  because more critically ill patients are taking precedence. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=100.2s)]
*  Abu Sitta says each day the hospital's tearing through medical supplies that should last a month and a half. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=103.2s)]
*  The WHO says Gaza needs quote, the immediate and safe delivery of food, medical supplies and other humanitarian aid. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  Ari Daniel, NPR News. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=118.0s)]
*  France is at its highest level of alert following the fatal stabbing of a teacher at a high school in the north of the country. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=120.0s)]
*  Police say the attack was by a former student at the school who was described as an Islamist radical. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=126.4s)]
*  And Pierce Eleanor Beardsley reports. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=131.8s)]
*  A 20-year-old Chechen has been arrested in the school attack and French Interior Minister Gérard Darmanin [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=133.8s)]
*  suggested there could be a link with the violence in the Middle East, though investigators have yet to announce a motive. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=139.8s)]
*  Several Paris tourist destinations were evacuated briefly Saturday amidst bomb threats [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=146.4s)]
*  and 7,000 French soldiers have been deployed to protect sensitive venues. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  Paris' historic Jewish quarter, the Marais, still seemed bustling, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  but kosher restaurant manager Romain Lodet says people are jittery. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=160.8s)]
*  The French government has banned all pro-Palestinian demonstrations for fear they could spark violence. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=172.8s)]
*  Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=178.8s)]
*  Business in the House of Representatives continues to be frozen because there's no speaker. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=180.8s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan won a GOP leadership election last week, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=185.8s)]
*  but appears to still be far short of the votes he needs to win the speakership election. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=189.8s)]
*  House Republicans are expected to meet and talk later today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=194.8s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlWYizxBoqg&t=198.8s)]
