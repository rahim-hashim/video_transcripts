*  Lawmakers conclude Johnson broke his own government's pandemic lockdown rules and repeatedly lied [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l284sQGsQo&t=110.64s)]
*  about it to Parliament. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l284sQGsQo&t=116.88000000000001s)]

*  In language echoing that of his friend Donald Trump, Johnson calls the investigation against [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l284sQGsQo&t=151.74s)]
