**NPR - News Now:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs)
*  Vice President Harris sat for an extended interview on CNN yesterday, and former President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=0.0s)]
*  told crowds in Wisconsin and Michigan that he'd make IVF free if he wins a second term. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=5.16s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Janene Herbst from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=11.88s)]
*  Vice President Harris touched on a number of campaign issues yesterday when she and running [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=15.6s)]

*  It was Harris' first extended interview since she replaced President Biden at the top of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=22.96s)]
*  the Democratic presidential ticket. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=28.0s)]
*  As NPR's Deepa Sivaram reports, Harris and Walz were campaigning in Georgia at the time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=30.04s)]
*  Harris told CNN that she would appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she were to win the election, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=35.32s)]
*  something former presidents like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have done. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=41.16s)]
*  She says it would be to the benefit of the American public. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=48.44s)]
*  are being made that have different views, different experiences. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=52.519999999999996s)]

*  would keep her word on not banning the practice. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=72.28s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=75.96s)]

*  Former President Trump told crowds in battleground states of Wisconsin and Michigan yesterday [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=81.74s)]
*  that if he wins, he wants to make the cost of in vitro fertilization free. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=87.0s)]
*  Those treatments can cost tens of thousands of dollars. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Under the Trump administration, your government will pay for or your insurance company will [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=95.08s)]
*  be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment, fertilization for women. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=101.32s)]

*  to patrol the border and that the operation is a show horse for Abbott. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=146.46s)]
*  You know, people want border security, but they want it done in a way that makes sense, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=149.78s)]
*  not just sending a bunch of troops down there who never signed up for that kind of duty. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=155.22000000000003s)]
*  In some cases, the families of soldiers who die during the border mission are eligible [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=160.74s)]
*  for compensation, a lump sum of $500,000. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  Out of 10 claims, six were denied. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=167.68s)]
*  Those deaths were deemed not mission related, according to the Texas Military Department. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=169.82s)]
*  I'm Gabriella Elcorta Solario in San Antonio. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjTyMUNJvs&t=174.01999999999998s)]
