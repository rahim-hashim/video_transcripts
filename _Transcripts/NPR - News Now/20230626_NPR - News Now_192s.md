# Putin And Prigozhin Not Seen Since Failed Mutiny Attempt | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI)
*  Yevgeny Prigozhin has not been seen since his failed mutiny attempt this weekend in Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Coast Guard is opening an investigation into the implosion of the submersible. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=5.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=10.48s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=11.48s)]
*  There are questions in Russia today about the whereabouts of President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  He's not been seen for two days following the brief failed mutiny by forces of the mercenary [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=19.16s)]
*  Wagner Group. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=23.6s)]
*  NPR's Greg Myrie says the Wagner Group's founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has also vanished. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=24.6s)]
*  Prigozhin gave an order for his troops to return to their camps, either in Ukraine or [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  in southern Russia. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=36.36s)]
*  There's been no indication that they're causing any trouble at the moment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=38.2s)]
*  But we haven't heard from Prigozhin either, since on Saturday night he announced that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=41.96s)]
*  he would be leaving Russia, going to Belarus. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=47.0s)]
*  We don't know if he's still in Russia, if he's gone to Belarus. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=51.3s)]
*  So he's gone quiet as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  And for the moment, his troops are quiet. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=56.519999999999996s)]

*  Coast Guard Captain Jason Neubauer says investigators will determine the cause of the submersible's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  implosion. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=106.52s)]
*  I have witnessed the personal impacts associated with these types of events. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=107.52s)]
*  And my primary goal is to prevent a similar occurrence by making the necessary recommendations [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=112.38s)]
*  to enhance the safety of the maritime domain worldwide. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=118.24s)]
*  The final report could also include recommendations for civil or criminal sanctions against people [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=121.66s)]
*  associated with the Titanic mission or the company that designed the destroyed submersible. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKclMTAL7GI&t=126.02s)]
