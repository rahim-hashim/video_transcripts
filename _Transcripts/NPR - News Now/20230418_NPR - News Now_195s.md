**NPR - News Now:** [April 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg)
*  Kansas City prosecutors have charged an 84-year-old white man with shooting a black teenager in the head. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=0.0s)]
*  And Russian President Vladimir Putin made a visit to Russian-held occupied territory in southern Ukraine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=12.0s)]
*  Prosecutors in Kansas City, Missouri have charged an 84-year-old white man with shooting a black teenager in the head. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=17.0s)]
*  The boy had knocked on his front door by accident. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=24.0s)]
*  Missouri prosecutor Zachary Thompson says Andrew Lester now faces a serious charge. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=27.0s)]
*  The defendant is charged with an A felony. It's the highest level of offense in the state of Missouri. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=33.0s)]
*  It carries with it a range of punishment of 10 to 30 years or life imprisonment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=38.0s)]
*  Other charges may not carry that same level of range of punishment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=42.0s)]
*  Thompson says the teenager did not enter Lester's home and that Lester shot him through a glass door. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=47.0s)]
*  The prosecutor also says there is a racial component to the shooting, but he did not elaborate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=53.0s)]
*  The White House says President Biden telephoned the teenager yesterday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=58.0s)]
*  The Alabama law enforcement agency has identified the four shooting victims killed at a teenager's birthday party last weekend. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=62.0s)]
*  But Alabama officials are not saying much more. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=70.0s)]
*  They haven't identified a suspect or informed the Alabama community whether there is further danger. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=74.0s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare visit to Russian-held territory in occupied southern Ukraine. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=80.0s)]
*  As NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow, this seems to be the closest Putin's come to the war's front lines since Russia invaded. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=87.0s)]
*  According to a statement released on the Kremlin's website, Putin made a surprise trip to occupied Kherson and Luhansk, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=95.0s)]
*  the first time he's been to either of those regions since Moscow illegally claimed to annex the territories last September. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=101.0s)]
*  Online videos showed Putin traveling to the region by helicopter and later sitting down with military commanders, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=107.0s)]
*  where he asked for their assessments of progress in the Russian military campaign. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=113.0s)]
*  Although the exact timing of the trip was unclear, the video also showed Putin referencing the Orthodox Easter holiday, which was this past Sunday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=117.0s)]
*  Putin's trip to the area comes amid widespread anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the coming weeks or months. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=125.0s)]
*  Charles Maynes in PR News, Moscow. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=131.0s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has appeared in a Russian courtroom. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=134.0s)]
*  He's been charged with spying. He denies it and is appealing his detention. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=138.0s)]
*  The U.S. government has declared that Gershkovich is now wrongfully detained by the Russian government. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=142.0s)]
*  President Biden will sign a new executive order today focused on making child care and other forms of caregiving more affordable. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=148.0s)]
*  NPR's Diba Shibaram reports. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=155.0s)]
*  Biden's new executive order will look at how the federal government can expand affordable child care and family care and provide benefits for care workers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=157.0s)]
*  One part of Biden's plan is looking at ways to make federal grants contingent on companies having child care programs in place, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=166.0s)]
*  which is something the administration has done in previous legislation, like the bill the president signed last year on semiconductors. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=173.0s)]
*  The White House says the plan will also improve access to home-based care for veterans and improve the affordability of child care on military installations. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=180.0s)]
*  Diba Shibaram, NPR News, Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=188.0s)]
*  It's NPR. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiFQZzZZjmg&t=191.0s)]
