**NPR - News Now:** [April 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A)
*  Good morning. Today is Wednesday, April 12th. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=0.0s)]
*  today's top stories. President Biden will deliver remarks later today at Ulster University [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  in Belfast, Northern Ireland. As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, Biden is there to commemorate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=10.64s)]
*  the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Accords. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=15.6s)]
*  The Good Friday agreement brokered by the U.S. ended decades of violence in Northern [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=18.88s)]
*  Ireland and created a power-sharing government. But Brexit has put strain on the agreement. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  And the National Assembly is non-functional. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=28.88s)]
*  previewed Biden's remarks on Air Force One. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=33.94s)]
*  The message is really congratulations on this anniversary and a focus on trade and economics [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  and improving that across the board. Kirby said Biden will engage with representatives [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=41.72s)]
*  of all five major political parties in Northern Ireland, but individually, not altogether. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=46.28s)]
*  Tamara Keith, NPR News Belfast. For the first time, the federal government [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=52.28s)]
*  has declared a synthetic drug cocktail an emergent threat to public health in the U.S. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=56.68s)]
*  The tranquilizer, xylazine, is used by veterinarians. It's often called Trank. White House officials [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=62.96s)]
*  say it's being mixed with the opioid fentanyl and is showing up in most of the street drug [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=69.42s)]
*  supply in the U.S. It's contributing to a surge in deaths. Officials say fatalities [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=74.32s)]
*  have increased tenfold in the South. The city of Louisville has released body camera [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=80.22s)]
*  footage of the deadly shooting at a downtown bank on Monday. Five people were killed and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=85.64s)]
*  more than half a dozen others were wounded. Louisville Deputy Police Chief Paul Humphrey [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=90.55999999999999s)]
*  lauded the courage of the responding officers as shown in the recording. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=96.24s)]
*  You can see the tension in that video. You can understand the stress that those officers [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=100.64s)]
*  are going through. Response wasn't perfect, but it was exactly the response we needed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  A Louisville officer shot and killed the gunman at the scene. The White House has released [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=109.08s)]
*  its emergency drought plan to save the nation's two largest reservoirs. They're in danger [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=114.2s)]
*  of dropping below levels that can no longer generate power or deliver water to southwest [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  cities and farms. NPR's Kirk Siegler reports the decision comes amid a 23-year mega drought [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  on the Colorado River. The Biden administration's plan would allow the government to force large [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=132.84s)]
*  mandatory water cuts in Nevada, Arizona, and California, even among water users who hold [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  senior rights to take all they're entitled to from the shrinking Colorado River. Such [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=144.44s)]
*  an extraordinary action would likely face lawsuits, but Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=149.4s)]
*  Camille Tooten says there has to be compromise due to the drought. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=153.56s)]
*  Fundamentally, it is one community comprised of 40 million people in landscapes that need [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  us to get this right. This federal plan comes as the seven states that rely on the Colorado [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=164.32s)]
*  River have so far failed to come up with their own voluntary agreement to cut water. Kirk [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=170.84s)]
*  Siegler, NPR News. This is NPR. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBOeuG4D0A&t=175.84s)]
