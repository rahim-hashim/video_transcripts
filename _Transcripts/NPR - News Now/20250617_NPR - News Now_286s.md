**NPR - News Now:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A)
*  President Trump left the G7 summit in Canada early to focus on the crisis in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=0.0s)]
*  And Russian drones and missiles have killed and injured dozens of people in strikes in Ukraine [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=5.36s)]
*  overnight. Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=10.32s)]
*  President Trump says he is seeking a, quote, real end to Iran's nuclear ambitions. But as [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=16.16s)]
*  NPR's Mara Eliason reports, it's not clear how he plans to accomplish that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=21.2s)]
*  Israel wants U.S. military help to destroy Iran's underground nuclear facility, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=25.44s)]
*  but Trump campaigned on keeping the U.S. out of foreign wars. On his way home from the G7 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  meeting in Canada, Trump told reporters he may send Vice President Vance and special envoy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=36.56s)]
*  Steve Witkoff to negotiate with Iran's foreign minister. Asked to explain his social media post [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=41.92s)]
*  calling on Tehran's citizens to evacuate, Trump said, quote, there's a lot of bad things happening [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=47.92s)]
*  there. Trump also said he didn't think Iran would strike U.S. assets in the region because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=53.2s)]
*  of the risk of retaliation. I think they know not to touch our troops. Are you sending them? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=58.56s)]
*  We'll find out. Trump has repeatedly said his bottom line is that Iran must never get a nuclear [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=64.48s)]
*  weapon. Mara Eliason, NPR News. Russia's latest attack on Ukraine is again one of its largest. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=69.92s)]
*  The attack killed at least 15 civilians and injured nearly 100 others in the capital, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=77.6s)]
*  Kiev. NPR's Joanna Kokizis reports the attack lasted more than nine hours. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  Ukrainian air defense units spent hours trying to shoot down drones and missiles. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  By sunrise, the air smelled burnt as thick plumes of smoke rose from parts of the city. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=97.52s)]
*  At least a dozen sites were hit, many of them residential buildings. Videos posted by Ukrainian [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=103.28s)]
*  authorities showed the collapse of part of an apartment complex. Emergency workers are trying [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=109.6s)]
*  to pull survivors from the rubble. The strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=114.8s)]

*  and other research areas disfavored by the Trump administration. From member station GBH, Craig [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=140.32s)]
*  Lemault has more. The federal judge ruled the NIH's terminations of those grants were arbitrary and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=146.32s)]
*  capricious and he ordered the agency to start paying for that research again. Attorney Rachel [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=151.6s)]

*  reason and without reasoning. The judge went on to say the government's actions in the case amounted [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=167.84s)]
*  to racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ population, saying he's never [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=172.88s)]
*  seen anything like this in his 40 years on the bench and he invited the plaintiff's attorneys to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=178.16s)]
*  offer evidence of harm to those populations so he could weigh in on that. For NPR News, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=182.88s)]
*  I'm Craig Lemault in Boston. The Trump administration is preparing to make its travel ban even bigger. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=187.35999999999999s)]

*  ketamine is going to plead guilty in the case. An autopsy found the drug played a role in Perry's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=211.92s)]
*  death in 2023. Dr. Salvador Placencia and four other people were accused last year in the case. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  Charleston, South Carolina is remembering one of the nation's most heinous hate crimes. NPR's Debbie [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=224.88s)]
*  Elliott reports it's been 10 years since a white supremacist killed nine black worshippers at [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=231.04s)]

*  says even a decade later the pain feels fresh. You wouldn't expect something like this to happen [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=256.4s)]
*  in your sanctuary. This is one of the safest places you should feel safe at all times [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=262.32s)]
*  and to have someone to violate their sanctity it really it hurts. The shooter intent on starting [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  a race war targeted mother Emmanuel, the oldest black congregation in the south. He's now on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0ExmQNi2A&t=272.15999999999997s)]
