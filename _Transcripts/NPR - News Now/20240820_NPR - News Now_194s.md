# Biden Greeted With A Standing Ovation At The DNC | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo)
*  President Biden was greeted with a standing ovation at the Democratic National Convention last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=0.0s)]
*  And a Wisconsin woman has been sentenced after pleading guilty to killing a man who sexually abused her when she was a minor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=4.8s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=11.6s)]
*  The first night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago ran long. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=16.4s)]
*  The last speaker was President Biden, who was enthusiastically greeted with a four-minute standing ovation before he even began. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=20.8s)]
*  He spoke for about an hour, and Biden, who dropped out of the presidential race less than a month ago, explained why he was stepping aside. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=28.0s)]
*  I spent the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=41.4s)]
*  I love the job, but I love my country more. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=46.6s)]
*  I love my country more. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Biden said he had a lot of work to do with the five months remaining in his presidency, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=56.2s)]
*  and he urged Americans to support Vice President Harris's presidential campaign. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=61.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Egypt to continue pushing for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=66.6s)]
*  Blinken says Israel has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal and that it is up to Hamas to agree. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=73.2s)]
*  And NPR's Janelle Estrin has more from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=79.2s)]
*  The latest ceasefire proposal on the table is a US-led attempt to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=82.0s)]
*  Blinken announced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is backing the proposal and said now it was up to Hamas to agree. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=88.6s)]
*  Hamas says the latest proposal favors Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=96.0s)]
*  Hamas official Osama Hamdan says the gaps have not been bridged. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=99.2s)]
*  The US has not published the details of the latest proposal, and it's unclear what details Netanyahu is agreeing to. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=103.6s)]
*  One main sticking point has been Israeli troop presence on Gaza's border with Egypt. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=110.4s)]
*  An Israeli official told NPR that Israel is insisting on keeping a presence along that border [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  and that the US and Egypt are discussing solutions. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=120.2s)]
*  Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Tel Aviv. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=123.2s)]
*  A Wisconsin woman has been sentenced to more than a decade in prison after pleading guilty to killing a man who sexually abused her when she was a minor. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=125.4s)]
*  Crystal Kaiser was 17 when she shot and killed 34-year-old Randy Vollar. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=134.8s)]
*  As Sarah Lear reports, the case drew international attention to the issue of trafficking. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=140.2s)]
*  Prosecutors admit Vollar was paying Kaiser and other underage girls for sex. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=145.6s)]
*  Kaiser's attorneys had planned to argue for her acquittal by citing a state law that shields trafficking victims. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=150.0s)]
*  But Kaiser took a plea deal after she was arrested for violating the terms of her bond. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=155.6s)]
*  Kenosha County judge said Kaiser's status as a trafficking victim does not excuse her crime. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=160.0s)]
*  But Claudine O'Leary, an advocate for trafficking survivors, says the criminal justice system routinely fails black women and girls like Kaiser. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=165.4s)]
*  I think that that's the message that Crystal has gotten throughout her whole experience, which is like, you don't count as a victim. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=173.8s)]
*  You don't count as important. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=179.4s)]
*  Prosecutors argued Kaiser planned the killing so she could steal Vollar's car. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=180.8s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Sarah Lear in Kenosha, Wisconsin. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=185.4s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMox86j5ENo&t=189.0s)]
