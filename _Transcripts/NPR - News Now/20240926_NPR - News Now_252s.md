# NYC Mayor Eric Adams Indicted On Federal Charges | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M)
*  Multiple news reports say New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted on federal charges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=0.0s)]
*  And both Israel and Hezbollah have rejected a ceasefire proposal, raising fears of a broader war in the Middle East. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=6.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=13.0s)]
*  Forecasters say Hurricane Helene will likely make landfall later today on Florida's Gulf Coast. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=17.0s)]
*  Heavy rain is already falling inland, and there are warnings of a life-threatening storm surge. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=22.0s)]
*  Helene's heavy rain will impact states farther north. All of Tennessee is under a flood watch or wind advisory. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=27.0s)]
*  Multiple news reports say New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted on federal charges. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=33.0s)]
*  From member station WNYC, Brigid Bergen reports, the apparent indictment is still under seal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=39.0s)]
*  News of the indictment comes after nearly a year of investigations into New York City Mayor Eric Adams' election campaign and city government. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=45.0s)]
*  In response, he released a video statement insisting any potential charges are based on lies, leaks and rumors meant to undermine him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=54.0s)]
*  Make no mistake. You elected me to lead this city and lead it, I will. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=62.0s)]
*  I humbly ask for your prayers and your patience as we see this through. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=68.0s)]
*  The mayor insists he will not resign, despite an increasing number of calls for him to step aside. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=74.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Brigid Bergen in New York. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=81.0s)]
*  The campaign of former President Donald Trump says he has been briefed on an alleged Iranian plot to kill him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=84.0s)]
*  NPR's Stephen Fowler reports Trump addressed that threat while campaigning yesterday in North Carolina. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=90.0s)]
*  At a manufacturing facility outside of Charlotte, Trump said if he were in charge and these threats happened, he'd tell Iran or the country in question. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=96.0s)]
*  That if you do anything to harm this person, we are going to blow your largest cities and the country itself to smithereens. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=103.0s)]
*  We're going to blow it to smithereens. You can't do that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=111.0s)]
*  In his remarks before a crowd of manufacturing workers, Trump also reiterated his proposal to enact tariffs and cut corporate taxes to lure jobs back to the U.S., [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=115.0s)]
*  a move economists say would likely raise prices and lead to retaliation. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=123.0s)]
*  Stephen Fowler, NPR News, Mint Hill, North Carolina. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=127.0s)]
*  Israeli officials have rejected a possible ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=130.0s)]
*  The U.S. has proposed a 21-day ceasefire plan. Israeli leaders say they will continue to fight. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=135.0s)]
*  Lebanon's prime minister is warning of a broader war in the Middle East if the hostilities continue. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=141.0s)]
*  NPR's Eder Peralta has more from Beirut. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=147.0s)]
*  For the past week, Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire across Lebanon's southern border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=150.0s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 500 people, according to Lebanon's health ministry. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=154.0s)]
*  At the UN Security Council, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Makati warned if this violence continues, a war could engulf the whole region. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=159.0s)]
*  Makati said he hoped to return home with a Security Council declaration calling for, quote, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=167.0s)]
*  an end to this aggression and respect for Lebanese sovereignty. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=173.0s)]
*  The U.S., France and other allies are calling for a 21-day ceasefire, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=177.0s)]
*  but Hezbollah has said they will not sign a ceasefire until there is a pause to the war in Gaza. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=181.0s)]
*  That prospect seems unlikely in the near term. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=186.0s)]
*  Eder Peralta, NPR News, Beirut. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=189.0s)]
*  Just days before a Kentucky sheriff allegedly gunned down a local judge, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=192.0s)]
*  the sheriff was questioned in a lawsuit regarding sexual abuse inside the courthouse. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=197.0s)]
*  As NPR's Frank Langford reports from Lexington, Kentucky police have yet to provide a motive for last week's killing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=202.0s)]
*  The lawsuit claims that Letcher County Sheriff Mickey Steins knew or should have known [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=208.0s)]
*  that a former deputy was sexually abusing a female drug defendant. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=212.0s)]
*  Steins has denied any knowledge of the crimes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=216.0s)]
*  Ned Pillersdorf, an attorney for the woman, said the atmosphere during questioning was tense. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=218.0s)]
*  He was agitated. He was generally defensive. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=223.0s)]
*  But in fairness to Sheriff Steins, I mean, he defended his conduct. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=227.0s)]
*  Three days later, Steins allegedly shot Judge Kevin Mullins to death. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=231.0s)]
*  Steins is pleaded not guilty. There's no indication that the cases are connected. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=235.0s)]
*  The shooting occurred in the judge's chambers, as did allegedly some of the abuse when the judge was not there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=239.0s)]
*  Frank Langford, NPR News, Lexington, Kentucky. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=245.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9UATqcom0M&t=248.0s)]
