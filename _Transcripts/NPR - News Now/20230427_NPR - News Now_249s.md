**NPR - News Now:** [April 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ)
*  House Republicans passed a bill yesterday to raise the government's borrowing limit, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and the Walt Disney Company has filed a lawsuit against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=4.64s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=9.28s)]
*  I'm Cora VaColeman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=10.28s)]
*  Republican-backed legislation that would increase the debt limit is now heading to the Senate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  NPR's Windsor Johnston reports it passed the House yesterday with no Democratic support. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=17.92s)]
*  The House passage could set the stage for another round of negotiations between Speaker [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy and President Biden, who haven't spoken since February. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=27.94s)]
*  Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has repeatedly warned that the bill, which ties a borrowing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=33.02s)]
*  limit increase to deep cuts in government spending, will go nowhere in the Senate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=38.1s)]
*  The GOP's Default on America Act, as we call it, does not bring us any closer to avoiding [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=43.22s)]
*  a first-ever default. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=50.34s)]
*  In fact, it only brings us dangerously closer to defaulting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=52.22s)]
*  Biden on Wednesday said that he will not meet with Speaker McCarthy about the debt [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=56.94s)]
*  limit, calling the issue not negotiable. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=61.22s)]
*  Windsor Johnston, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=64.7s)]
*  President Biden has held the second White House state dinner of his presidency. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=67.62s)]
*  Last night's event was for South Korea's leader and celebrated the 70th anniversary [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=72.02s)]
*  of the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=76.22s)]
*  And Piers Marie Andrusiewicz reports. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=79.66s)]
*  Nearly 200 guests were in attendance for the black tie dinner in honor of South Korea President [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=82.18s)]
*  Yoon Sung-yeol. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=87.0s)]
*  The list of notables included actor Angelina Jolie. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=89.04s)]
*  Following a dinner featuring crab cakes and ribs, the guests were treated to live performances [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  of Broadway tunes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=97.36s)]
*  Then, President Yoon offered a tribute of his own. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=99.16s)]
*  A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=102.48s)]
*  The song is one of the South Korean president's favorites. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=114.76s)]
*  Marie Andrusiewicz, NPR News, Washington. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  The Walt Disney Company is suing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other officials. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  The company says the Republican governor is orchestrating a plan of government retaliation, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=128.72s)]
*  simply because the company said things that DeSantis did not like. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=133.72s)]
*  It's the latest in a tit-for-tat exchange. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=137.96s)]
*  Last year, the Disney Company objected to Florida's so-called Don't Say Gay law. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=140.96s)]
*  NPR's Greg Allen says DeSantis responded by urging Florida lawmakers to act against [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=145.96s)]
*  Disney's property rights in Orlando. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  DeSantis is urging Republican lawmakers pass the bill that stripped Disney of its self-governing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  authority. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  But before that law took effect, Disney signed a deal with its outgoing board, allowing it [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  to retain development rights on the 40-square-mile district. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=163.72s)]
*  Yesterday, the new board met near Orlando and voted to invalidate that deal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  The board's lawyers detailed what they said were procedural missteps made by Disney that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  they believe make the agreement void and unenforceable. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=175.8s)]
*  And moments after that vote, Disney filed its lawsuit against DeSantis and other officials [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=179.24s)]
*  in federal court. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  NPR's Greg Allen prepared that report. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  A Montana lawmaker has been banned from the state House chambers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  Montana Public Radio's Shaili Rager reports this follows a protest that disrupted business [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=190.44s)]
*  on Monday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  Montana House Republicans all voted in favor of sanctioning Representative Zoe Zephyr for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=197.4s)]
*  her support of protesters who filled the chamber on Monday. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=202.56s)]
*  The protesters were there in response to Zephyr, who is transgender, being blocked from speaking [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=206.12s)]
*  after making remarks on a bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=211.56s)]
*  Republican leaders say Zephyr violated the rules of decorum when she held her microphone [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=216.6s)]
*  above her head, aiming to amplify the shouts of protesters. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=220.44s)]
*  That was after the House Speaker ordered the chamber to clear. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=224.54s)]
*  Zephyr says the Republicans' actions are undemocratic. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=227.78s)]
*  All you are doing is using decorum as a tool of oppression. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=231.18s)]
*  Zephyr will be allowed to participate in committee meetings and vote remotely, but not debate. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=235.34s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Shaili Rager in Helena. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lry_IFiFTJQ&t=240.78s)]
