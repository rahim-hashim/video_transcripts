# Haley Loses, But Vows To Stay In Primary Race | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8)
*  Former President Donald Trump has declared victory in the New Hampshire Republican primary, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=0.0s)]
*  and a Russian military plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war has crashed, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=4.88s)]
*  apparently killing everyone on board. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=9.24s)]
*  Good morning. Ankora Vakulman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=11.44s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump has carried the New Hampshire Republican primary, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=16.0s)]
*  according to a call by the Associated Press. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=19.6s)]
*  He garnered about 55 percent of the vote compared to challenger, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=21.92s)]
*  former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  She got about 43 percent of the vote. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump used part of his victory speech to express frustration with Haley. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=30.36s)]
*  She was up and I said, wow, she's doing like a speech like she won. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  She didn't win, she lost. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=39.72s)]
*  Haley insists she won't quit the race, and she used her speech last night to jab at Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=41.28s)]
*  With Donald Trump, you have one bout of chaos after another. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=46.68s)]
*  This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=51.88s)]
*  You can't fix Joe Biden's chaos with Republican chaos. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=56.36s)]
*  But history is not on Haley's side. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=60.76s)]
*  No Republican candidate in modern political primary history has ever won [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=62.96s)]
*  the presidential nomination without prevailing in Iowa or New Hampshire. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=67.24s)]
*  Trump has now won both. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=71.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Associated Press has called the New Hampshire [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=73.44s)]
*  Democratic primary election for President Biden. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=75.88s)]
*  NPR's Elena Moore reports Biden wasn't on the ballot. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=78.84s)]
*  Supporters had to write in his name. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Biden won because of a successful write in effort led by state Democrats. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  The president deliberately chose not to campaign there because state leaders [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  refused to follow the new primary calendar, which was supposed to make [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=92.48s)]
*  South Carolina the first Democratic primary state instead of New Hampshire. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=96.48s)]
*  Still, calendar aside, Biden has a win under his belt. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=100.72s)]
*  He defeated his long shot primary opponent, Democratic congressman Dean Phillips. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=103.80000000000001s)]

*  in recent months, including a December missile strike that killed 25 people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Dy881dhC8&t=151.27999999999997s)]
