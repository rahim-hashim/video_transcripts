# Evacuations Underway After Dam Breach In Southern Ukraine | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg)
*  Evacuations are underway after a major dam collapsed in southern Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=0.0s)]
*  And former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce today he's running for president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=4.8s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=9.6s)]
*  A key dam has collapsed in southern Ukraine today, raising fears of widespread flooding in the region. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=14.0s)]
*  NPR's Greg Myhre reports it also adds to the risks facing a nearby nuclear power plant occupied by Russian troops. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=19.6s)]
*  Video images show water surging through a large collapsed section of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=27.2s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia is to blame, and officials say dozens of cities, towns and villages downstream are in immediate danger of flooding. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=34.0s)]
*  Russia, in turn, is blaming Ukraine. Neither side provided proof to back their claims. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  In addition, the dam created a large reservoir used to cool the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant about 100 miles upriver. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=49.6s)]
*  That reservoir is now shrinking rapidly. Ukrainian and United Nations officials say they're concerned and are closely monitoring the nuclear plant, which is under the control of Russian troops. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=57.6s)]
*  Greg Myhre, NPR News, Kyiv. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=69.6s)]
*  South Korea's military says Chinese and Russian warplanes have intruded into the nation's air defense zone without notice. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=72.6s)]
*  NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul similar incursions took place last year and in 2019 when South Korean aircraft fired warning shots. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=80.6s)]
*  South Korea's military says it dispatched fighter jets to the area after four Chinese and four Russian warplanes entered its air defense identification zone. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=89.6s)]
*  South Korea says the planes did not enter its territorial airspace, which is separate from the identification zone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=98.6s)]
*  Foreign planes are supposed to identify themselves before entering, but China and Russia say they don't recognize the zones. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=104.6s)]
*  China's Defense Ministry said it conducted joint patrols with Russia over the East China Sea and Sea of Japan Tuesday as part of an annual cooperation plan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=111.6s)]
*  The incursions are seen by some as a show of force against the U.S. and its allies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=120.6s)]
*  Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Seoul. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=125.6s)]
*  Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to announce today that he is running for the Republican presidential nomination. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=127.6s)]
*  It's not clear how popular he will be with GOP voters. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=134.6s)]
*  He is focused on opposing former President Donald Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=137.6s)]
*  New Hampshire Public Radio's Josh Rogers says Christie will launch his campaign in New Hampshire, where he previously ran a targeted campaign for president. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=140.6s)]
*  In 2016, he basically focused his entire campaign here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=149.6s)]
*  He did the things that you purportedly need to do to be successful here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=154.6s)]
*  He started early. He did a lot of retail campaigning. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=158.6s)]
*  He took whatever question voters cared to ask him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=160.6s)]
*  But he did end up finishing sixth here and then dropped out of the race. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=164.6s)]
*  Josh Rogers reporting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=168.6s)]
*  Former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to publicly launch his presidential bid tomorrow. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=170.6s)]
*  Smoke from several Canadian wildfires continues to drift south into the U.S. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=175.6s)]
*  The National Weather Service has issued air quality alerts today across New England and down into Maryland. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=181.6s)]
*  Some World War II veterans are back in Normandy, France today. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=187.6s)]
*  Lisa Bryant reports from Paris they're marking nearly eight decades since the June 6th landing by allied troops. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=191.6s)]
*  This 79th D-Day anniversary is being marked by French fighter jets flying over the Normandy beaches and ceremonies, the main one presided over by President Emmanuel Macron. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=198.6s)]
*  Dozens of surviving World War II veterans now in their 90s and older are back in Normandy to meet and share memories. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=209.6s)]
*  Roughly 40 U.S. veterans formed a wheelchair parade Sunday in the picturesque village of Saint-Mériglis, liberated by American paratroopers. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=217.6s)]
*  Thousands of allied and German soldiers were killed or wounded during the 1944 landing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=226.6s)]
*  World War II ended the following year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=231.6s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Lisa Bryant in Paris. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOx0ME5jTXg&t=234.6s)]
