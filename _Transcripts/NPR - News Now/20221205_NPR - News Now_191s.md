**NPR - News Now:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus)
*  Two of North Carolina's electrical substations were attacked over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=0.0s)]
*  And a case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court today could undermine public accommodations [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=4.86s)]
*  laws across the country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=8.92s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=10.94s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=11.94s)]
*  The FBI has joined the investigation into who attacked two power substations in central [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=14.86s)]
*  North Carolina Saturday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=19.22s)]
*  Officials say the attack was deliberate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=21.34s)]
*  From member station WUNC J. Price reports tens of thousands were plunged into darkness. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=23.42s)]
*  Nearly 40,000 customers were without electricity Sunday in Moore County. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=29.38s)]
*  And a power company spokesman said it could be Thursday before most have power again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=34.36s)]
*  County officials opened an emergency shelter and closed schools for today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=40.1s)]
*  Sheriff Ronnie Field says residents would suffer badly in an extended blackout, and so would [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=44.62s)]
*  the local economy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  We're just getting over the COVID. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And now this. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  And how it's going to hurt all of our restaurants and the businesses and stuff. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  It's going to hurt. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=59.2s)]

*  laws across the country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=74.64s)]
*  As NPR's Nina Totenberg reports, at issue are laws that bar businesses from discriminating [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=76.2s)]
*  based on race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=80.9s)]
*  This case pits two cherished constitutional principles against each other. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=84.92s)]
*  On one side are laws that guarantee same-sex couples equal access to all businesses that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=89.8s)]
*  offer their services to the public. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=95.14s)]
*  On the other are business owners who see themselves as artists and don't want to use their talents [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=97.56s)]
*  to express a message they don't believe in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  In this case, specifically, same-sex marriage. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=105.72s)]
*  A Colorado custom web designer opposed to same-sex marriage is challenging her state's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=109.12s)]
*  public accommodation law, which would require her to create web designs for same-sex couples [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=114.34s)]
*  if she offers wedding design services generally. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=120.66s)]
*  Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. Senate runoff election in Georgia comes to an end tomorrow on Election Day. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=126.58s)]
*  Republican challenger Hershel Walker is facing Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=131.86s)]
*  Both candidates campaigned on Sunday not far away from each other. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=136.2s)]
*  Walker was in the Republican-leaning town of Loganville, and Warnock spoke to supporters [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=140.0s)]
*  at the University of Georgia in Athens. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=144.2s)]
*  If you stand with me for two more days, I'll stand with you for six more years. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=146.76s)]
*  Let's get this thing done one more time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=152.88s)]
*  God bless you, Athens, Georgia. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=157.0s)]
*  The outcome of the race will not determine control of the U.S. Senate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=159.08s)]
*  Democrats want enough seats in the midterm elections to maintain their Senate majority. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=163.04s)]
*  The world's wealthiest countries have set price caps on how much they're going to pay [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=168.28s)]
*  for Russian oil. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=172.6s)]
*  It's $60 a barrel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=174.36s)]
*  This move comes as the European Union starts banning some Russian crude oil imports. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=176.04s)]
*  It's all aimed at stopping Russia from earning money in order to finance the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=181.0s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctFIOdYUus&t=187.8s)]
