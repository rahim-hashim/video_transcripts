**NPR - News Now:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU)
*  Vice President Harris says her campaign is prepared for various post-election scenarios. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=0.0s)]
*  And a new report out says it could take hundreds of years for Gaza's economy to recover from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=5.44s)]
*  the war with Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=10.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=12.02s)]
*  I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=13.02s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump completed a second straight day of campaigning in North [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=16.34s)]
*  Carolina yesterday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=19.66s)]
*  At a rally in Greensboro, he promoted early voting. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=21.36s)]
*  But as the campaign enters its final two weeks, Trump also continued to say inflammatory things [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=24.16s)]
*  to the delight of his fans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=29.7s)]
*  NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=31.5s)]
*  Trump spoke for more than an hour and a half, longer than he has spoken at many recent rallies [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  as he accelerates campaigning ahead of Election Day. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=38.44s)]
*  In his speech, Trump once again lied and said he won the election in 2020, as he has done [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=41.78s)]
*  many times, and falsely claimed that undocumented immigrants are, quote, conquering towns. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=45.96s)]
*  He also insulted his opponents, calling former President Barack Obama a jerk and suggesting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  Kamala Harris is, quote, on drugs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=56.32s)]
*  Former Democratic Congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard also made a brief [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=59.7s)]
*  appearance voicing her support for Trump and announcing that she is now a Republican. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=63.64s)]
*  Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News, Greensboro, North Carolina. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=68.64s)]
*  Vice President Harris says her campaign is prepared for various post-election scenarios [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=71.92s)]
*  that includes the possibility that former President Trump might try to declare victory [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=76.8s)]
*  before all the votes are fully counted. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=81.52s)]
*  NPR's Deepa Sivaram reports. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  In an interview with NBC News, Harris said, quote, of course her team is considering that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=86.04s)]
*  Trump will try once again to subvert the election. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  But in the next two weeks, she says she's focused on beating him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  And we will deal with election night and the days after as they come. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  And we have the resources and the expertise and the focus on that as well. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=102.28s)]
*  Harris pointed to Trump's actions during the January 6th insurrection on the Capitol and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  called it a, quote, serious matter. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=112.4s)]
*  Deepa Sivaram, NPR News. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=114.6s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Saudi Arabia today. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=116.16s)]
*  He's continuing the Biden administration's push for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  There's no sign that stalled peace talks may resume. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=123.88s)]
*  A new United Nations report says it could take 350 years to bring Gaza's economy back [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  to pre-war levels. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=133.48s)]
*  But NPR's Kat Lonsdorf reports Gaza's economy was already precarious before this current [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=135.2s)]
*  war began. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=140.64s)]
*  The report by the UN Organization for Trade and Development lays out various scenarios [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=142.12s)]
*  for Gaza's economic recovery. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=145.9s)]
*  The assessment of 350 years for recovery is based on Gaza's low previous growth rate [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=148.0s)]
*  and the destruction in the past year of war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Before this current war, Gaza's average yearly economic growth rate was just 0.4 percent, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=155.8s)]
*  due in large part to an Israeli and Egyptian blockade after Hamas seized power in 2007 [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=161.44s)]
*  and multiple other wars. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  This war has left critical infrastructure in ruins and neighborhoods and roads obliterated. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=168.2s)]
*  The report points out that if conditions are improved, with significant investment and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=173.44s)]
*  no blockade or military operations, recovery could be faster. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=177.04s)]
*  But even in the most optimistic scenario, it will still take until 2050. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyx1Sn_hTHU&t=181.39999999999998s)]
