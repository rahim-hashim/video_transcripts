# Filings Expose Crisis At Fox News After 2020 Election | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY)
*  A special grand jury found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Georgia's 2020 election results. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=0.0s)]
*  And legal filings exposed the crisis at Fox News after then-President Trump's failed reelection bid. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  A court in Georgia has released parts of a special grand jury report. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=17.46s)]
*  Members investigated efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=21.12s)]
*  The special grand jury said that their investigation found no evidence of widespread fraud that could result in overturning the election. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=28.32s)]
*  Trump had railed at Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger telling him to find more votes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=35.76s)]
*  Raffensperger refused. He now says the special grand jury's report vindicates his team. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=42.2s)]
*  When you give people the facts, you know, you can just see that their goodness shines through. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=47.44s)]
*  We leaned into the Constitution. We leaned into the rule of law. And I just did my job. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=51.68s)]
*  The special grand jury also said there's evidence some witnesses lied to them under oath. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=56.68s)]
*  The panel is recommending that prosecutors file charges. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  New legal filings show the sense of crisis that pervaded Fox News Channel after then-President Donald Trump lost reelection in 2020. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  As NPR's David Falkenfleck reports, Fox News stars knew Trump's claims of election fraud were bogus, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=74.06s)]
*  but also feared their audiences would abandon the network. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=80.5s)]
*  The revelations came in a legal filing by Dominion Voting Systems, which has sued Fox News for $1.6 billion for defamation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=84.1s)]
*  Fox executives and stars, including Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Laura Ingraham, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=91.64s)]
*  called the conspiracies whipped up by Trump's allies mind-blowingly nuts, totally off the rails, and even worse, in private texts and emails. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  They also denounced Fox News journalists who dealt straight with Fox viewers, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=103.32s)]
*  from Fox's projection of Joe Biden's win in Arizona to everything that followed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=106.96s)]
*  Executives angrily said it was more important to protect Fox's brand. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=111.44s)]
*  A Fox News spokeswoman says the filing cherry-picked exchanges and presented them out of context. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=115.68s)]
*  The trial is set to begin in April. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=120.72s)]
*  David Falkenfleck, NPR News. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=123.06s)]
*  EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited East Palestine, Ohio yesterday following this month's fiery train derailment. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=125.16s)]
*  Julie Grant of the Allegheny Front reports, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=132.9s)]
*  Local residents are very worried about the toxic chemicals and poisonous fume that leached out of the cars. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=135.88000000000002s)]
*  Regan said officials have tested the air in nearly 500 homes in East Palestine, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=142.56s)]
*  and they have not found any hazardous chemicals related to the incident. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  Many residents are concerned about the strong smells, and some have reported rashes and other health issues. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Asked if he would allow his own children to return if they live there, he said, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=157.44s)]
*  If those homes have been tested and given a clean bill of health, yes, as a father, I trust the science, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=161.96s)]
*  I trust the methodology that this state is using, and as a parent, I would. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=168.84s)]
*  Regan encouraged people to contact the EPA to get their home air and water wells tested, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=173.48s)]
*  and in the meantime to use bottled water. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=179.0s)]
*  He said the EPA will hold Norfolk Southern responsible for cleanup and costs from the incident. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=181.64s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Julie Grant in Kent, Ohio. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=187.64s)]
*  You're listening to NPR. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SebvDIPDyrY&t=191.08s)]
