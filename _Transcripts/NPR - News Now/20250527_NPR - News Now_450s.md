**NPR - News Now:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE)

*  on Ukraine over the weekend and dozens of people were injured after a car [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=4.4s)]
*  plowed into a crowd of pedestrians yesterday in Liverpool, England. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=8.8s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=12.88s)]
*  Stocks opened higher this morning after President Trump postponed his threat to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=17.28s)]

*  President Trump's about-face is the latest instance of him declaring an impending [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=27.919999999999998s)]
*  tariff and throwing global markets into a panic only to later walk it back. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=32.16s)]
*  This time around Trump said he and the European Commission president Ursula [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=37.36s)]
*  von der Leyen had a quote, very nice call that prompted the delay. As recently as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=40.96s)]
*  Friday Trump said he was not looking for a deal with the EU and that the 50% [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=46.0s)]
*  tariff would go into effect on the 1st of June. That rate would have come after he [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=49.92s)]
*  had already imposed a reciprocal tariff on the EU in April of 20 percent which [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=54.16s)]
*  itself was delayed. An EU spokesperson says there is new momentum behind trade [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=58.72s)]
*  talks with the Trump administration. Rob Schmitz, NPR News, Berlin. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=63.67999999999999s)]
*  French president Emmanuel Macron says he hopes President Trump's anger toward [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=68.64s)]
*  Russia will translate into action. I'm not happy with what Putin's doing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=72.08s)]
*  He's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=76.56s)]
*  I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him but he's sending rockets [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=79.92s)]
*  into cities and killing people and I don't like it at all. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=84.8s)]
*  Trump has warned of possible US sanctions on Russia after a huge Russian air assault [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=88.64s)]
*  this weekend on Ukraine and Piers Eleanor Beersley reports. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=93.44s)]
*  Macron said he hoped Trump's indignation would result in the US coming together [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=97.12s)]
*  with the Europeans for a much bigger sanctions package, one that could quote [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=101.36s)]
*  dissuade Russia and finally bring it into the conflict. He added, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=105.84s)]
*  I believe that President Trump realizes when President Putin told him on the phone [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=110.0s)]
*  he was ready for peace that he was lying. Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Maers [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=113.84s)]
*  now says that Germany, Britain and France will no longer impose restrictions on the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=119.28s)]
*  use of their long-range weapons. He said, Ukraine can now defend itself by attacking [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=123.44s)]
*  military facilities in Russia. Eleanor Beersley, NPR News, Paris. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Authorities in Liverpool, England say about 50 people have been injured after a car [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=132.48s)]
*  plowed through a crowd of pedestrians. As Willem Marx reports, thousands of people [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=137.2s)]
*  were celebrating a soccer competition victory by their local team. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=142.0s)]
*  Four children were among those injured with more than two dozen hospitalized and several [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=146.16s)]
*  of those still quote very, very ill, according to the local mayor. Police have arrested the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  man believed to be the vehicle's driver, a 53-year-old, but said they do not currently [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  consider the incident to be terror related. Videos and eyewitness accounts suggest the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=157.92s)]
*  car reversed, then accelerated suddenly through the crowd after being surrounded and rocked [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=161.68s)]
*  by passers-by. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called the events appalling, but [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  officials have warned the public not to speculate online about the suspect's motives, ethnicity [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=170.0s)]
*  or religious background, as has been the case with other recent acts of UK violence. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Willem Marx in London. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  have filed suit this morning in federal court against the Trump administration. This is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  over the president's recent executive order purportedly barring the use of congressionally [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=189.12s)]
*  appropriated funds for NPR and PBS. The lawsuit claims the administration is unlawfully taking [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=194.08s)]
*  away Congress's right to direct how federal money will be spent and to pass laws. It also [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  alleges this is a violation of the First Amendment. The White House has not had an immediate comment [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=206.24s)]
*  in response to the lawsuit. The Senate has the government spending bill passed last week by the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=211.84s)]
*  House. It would cut hundreds of billions of dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=217.04s)]
*  Program, or SNAP. Texas Public Radio's Paul Flav reports the nonpartisan Congressional Budget [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=221.76s)]
*  Office estimates several million people could lose access to what's also known as food stamps. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=227.92s)]
*  The nearly $300 billion in cuts being proposed pushed the cost of food benefits onto the states [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  for the first time. Northwestern University economist Diane Schanzinbach says if the U.S. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=238.16s)]
*  sinks into a recession, states with shrinking revenues and must-balance budgets won't be able [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=243.04s)]
*  to afford it. We'd be setting up a situation where just when people are most needing SNAP benefits, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=248.0s)]
*  they're hardest to get. The proposal also increases work requirements on the poor, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=254.32s)]
*  which Schanzinbach says will push people off the program but will do little to increase labor [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=258.24s)]
*  participation. The Senate will take up the bill in coming days. I'm Paul Flav in San Antonio. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=262.32s)]
*  A U.S.-backed group says it has begun delivering food in Gaza to address widespread hunger. The [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=268.16s)]
*  effort is facing criticism from the United Nations and aid groups in Gaza, and its director has [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  resigned, as NPS Daniel Estrin reports from Tel Aviv. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=279.12s)]
*  it's begun supplying food parcels in a new zone guarded by Israeli soldiers. Israel says the system [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=284.72s)]
*  will deny supplies to Hamas and weaken its control in Gaza. Israel says the food will be mostly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=290.56s)]
*  confined to a zone in southern Gaza in an attempt to get Palestinians to move there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=296.32s)]
*  The UN and groups who have been providing aid say this would amount to forcible displacement [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=301.44s)]
*  and restrictions on aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has appointed a new director, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=306.56s)]
*  John Acree, a former official with the U.S. Agency for International Development. The group has not [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=311.92s)]
*  divulged its funding. Hamas warned Palestinians not to take food from the group. Daniel Estrin, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=317.2s)]
*  NPR News, Tel Aviv. Dozens of military families are still displaced in San Diego after a small [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=323.04s)]
*  jet crashed into their neighborhood last Thursday. Six people aboard the plane were killed. There's a [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=329.6s)]
*  lot of wreckage that must be cleared away from the crash scene and many people still cannot go home. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Tony Terevainen is the CEO of the group Support the Enlisted Project. He's linking affected [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=341.12s)]
*  families with social workers. What we're able to do with those families is have our social workers [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=347.04s)]
*  work with each of those families and kind of help them start to put together a game plan to move [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=351.68s)]
*  forward. Officials say there was heavy fog at the time of the crash last week. They say the nearby [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=356.56s)]
*  runway lights were not working. There was also a weather alert system that was out of order. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=361.76s)]
*  Authorities in Louisiana say they've recaptured three more escaped prisoners. They were part of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=367.6s)]
*  a group of 10 that broke out of a New Orleans jail earlier this month. Two of them are caught [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=372.4s)]
*  in Texas. That leaves two prisoners still at large. The jail break was brazen. The group slid [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=377.36s)]
*  through a hole behind a toilet. Louisiana authorities allege the prisoners had help in escaping. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=383.12s)]
*  They have arrested nine people, including a jail plumber. The Scripps National Spelling Bee gets [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  underway today and NPR's Ava Pukac reports the bee is marking its 100th anniversary. The first [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=394.32s)]
*  winning word of the inaugural Scripps National Spelling Bee was gladiolus. Only nine spellers [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=400.8s)]
*  competed that year. Now 100 years later, 243 spellers are competing across four days. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=406.08s)]
*  As part of the bee, the spellers participate in a vocabulary round, answering multiple choice [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=412.64s)]
*  questions that Scripps says are designed to advance the bee's focus on word knowledge and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=417.52s)]
*  literacy. The final round of this year's bee is set for Thursday evening. If the competition goes [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  long, it could feature a newer element of the competition, the spell off. Each remaining [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=428.4s)]
*  speller gets 90 seconds to spell as many words as they can from a predetermined list of words, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=433.52s)]
*  with the champion being the speller that spells the most words correctly. Ava Pukac, NPR News. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alji0-btHLE&t=439.59999999999997s)]
