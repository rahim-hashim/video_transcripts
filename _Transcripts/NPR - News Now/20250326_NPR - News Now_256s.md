# Trump's National Security Adviser Takes Responsibility For Group Chat | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4)
*  National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has taken responsibility for a signal group chat that was used to discuss war plans for Yemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=0.0s)]
*  And the Federal Appeals Corps will allow the Trump administration to temporarily freeze a refugee program. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=7.68s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=13.92s)]
*  National Security Adviser Mike Waltz says he takes responsibility for creating a group chat on the commercial messaging app Signal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Top Trump administration members used Signal recently to talk about secret war plans, including the Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=25.880000000000003s)]
*  But that chat also included a journalist. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=36.44s)]
*  Gabbard and Ratcliffe were grilled by a Senate panel yesterday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas says they will face more questions today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=42.72s)]
*  The same intelligence officials are testifying before House lawmakers today. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=46.32s)]
*  They'll no doubt face more questions. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=49.24s)]
*  But stepping back a bit, the top Democrat in the House and Senate are both calling for an investigation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Democrats, of course, don't have a lot of power. They're in the minority. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=55.64s)]
*  Republicans control both Houses of Congress. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  Some GOP senators have expressed concern about this security breach and how this all went down. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  That includes the Senate Majority Leader John Thune. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=65.8s)]
*  He told reporters yesterday that they need to figure out what happened. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=68.2s)]
*  NPR's Ryan Lucas reporting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=71.2s)]
*  A note, the CEO of NPR, Catherine Maher, also chairs the board of the nonprofit Signal Foundation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=73.16s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country is moving toward peace by accepting a ceasefire in the Black Sea. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=80.56s)]
*  NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports this will allow Russia to export its grain and fertilizer. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=87.32s)]
*  Ukraine had successfully chased Russia's Black Sea fleet and commercial ships from the waters with air and sea drone and missile attacks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=92.84s)]
*  Ukrainian Parliament member Oleksandr Merezhko says the Black Sea deal is a concession from Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=101.52s)]
*  It means that we're trying to demonstrate that we are committed to peace and we agree with ceasefire proposals put forward by President Trump. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=107.84s)]
*  He says Russia violated ceasefire agreements for years after 2015 when France and Germany were trying to stop the war in the Donbass. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=116.44s)]
*  Basically, I remain skeptical, but you know, who knows? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  Merezhko says Ukraine wants to get back its prisoners of war and stop the attacks on civilian infrastructure and its cities. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=127.92s)]
*  Eleanor Beardsley in PR News, Kyiv. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=135.0s)]
*  A federal appeals court will let the Trump administration temporarily freeze a refugee program. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=137.16s)]
*  NPR's Jasmine Garz reports it's for people displaced by conflict, disasters or persecution. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  After taking office, President Trump immediately paused refugee resettlement, saying that the U.S. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=149.24s)]
*  lacks the ability to absorb large numbers, that taxpayers' money should not be spent on this program, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  and that there need to be assurances that refugees can assimilate into the country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=161.16s)]
*  In late February, a federal judge temporarily blocked that freeze, saying that while a president does have the power to suspend refugee admissions, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=166.6s)]
*  that power is not limitless. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=175.2s)]
*  Refugees who were approved before President Trump took office on January 20th will still be processed, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=177.56s)]
*  but no new applications as the case makes its way through the courts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=184.76s)]
*  Jasmine Garz, NPR News, New York. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=190.0s)]
*  A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to stop its attempts to deport a Columbia University student. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=192.92s)]
*  She had participated in pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=199.6s)]
*  NPR's Adrienne Florido reports immigration agents have been trying to arrest the student for weeks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=203.32s)]
*  Yun Seo Chung is a 21-year-old South Korean national who's lived in the U.S. since she was seven. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=209.24s)]
*  She's a legal permanent resident. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=214.8s)]
*  On March 5th, she was one of several students that New York police arrested at a pro-Palestinian sit-in protest at a campus building. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=216.84s)]
*  She was cited and let go. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=224.12s)]
*  Her lawyers say that days later, ICE agents showed up at her parents' house looking for her. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=225.96s)]
*  Officials said her green card had been revoked. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  A few days after that, federal agents searched her Columbia dorm room. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  Chung sued in New York federal court to block the government from arresting or deporting her. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=237.84s)]
*  She says she's being targeted for her activism. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  Now a judge has temporarily granted Chung's request while she fights the government's case against her. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=245.28s)]
*  Adrienne Florido, NPR News. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=250.24s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKQqnqrpNh4&t=252.24s)]
