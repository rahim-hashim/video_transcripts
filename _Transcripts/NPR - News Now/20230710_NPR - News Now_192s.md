# Biden Meets With Sunak Ahead Of Annual NATO Summit | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [July 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg)
*  President Biden met with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak today in London, and at least one person has died as heavy rains continue to pummel New England. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=9.0s)]
*  President Biden met British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London today. Their countries are the top donors of military aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=14.0s)]
*  But, appears Lauren Freyer reports from London, Biden and Sunak have at least two disagreements. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=21.0s)]
*  UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak opposes the use of cluster bombs, which Washington is giving to Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=26.0s)]
*  Those are weapons engineered to scatter sub munitions over a wide area. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=32.0s)]
*  The UK is a signatory to a convention that prohibits them. The US is not. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=37.0s)]
*  The other sticking point is the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. Both the US and the UK support that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=42.0s)]
*  But they differ over how fast to do it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=49.0s)]
*  President Biden has said Kiev is not yet ready because of the war. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=52.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Sunak's government has called for it to be fast-tracked. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=56.0s)]
*  This is Biden and Sunak's sixth meeting, and they're both heading to a NATO summit in Lithuania next. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=60.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, London. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=66.0s)]
*  Another issue Biden will focus on at the summit is helping Sweden gain admission to NATO too. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=69.0s)]
*  Turkey has been blocking Sweden's path. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=74.0s)]
*  Turkey has demanded that Sweden do more to crack down on Kurdish militants. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=77.0s)]
*  Turkey considers them terrorists. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=81.0s)]
*  White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says it is not clear how quickly Sweden can join NATO. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=83.0s)]
*  I can't characterize how close, how far. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=89.0s)]
*  All I can say is that we believe that Sweden should be admitted to NATO as soon as possible. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=92.0s)]
*  We believe that there should be a pathway to do so, and we will now see how that will unfold as we head into Vilnius. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=97.0s)]
*  Whether it happens at Vilnius or happens in the period that follows, that remains to be determined. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=105.0s)]
*  Turkey's president said today that he now thinks Turkey should be admitted to the European Union before Sweden can join NATO. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=110.0s)]
*  Heavy rains are moving through much of New England this morning, where flood watches and warnings are in effect. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=118.0s)]
*  Flooding is blamed for at least one death in New York's Lower Hudson Valley, and Piers Marie Andrusiewicz reports. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=123.0s)]
*  New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency for Orange and Ontario counties, describing the flooding as a very dangerous situation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=130.0s)]
*  Some parts of the state saw up to eight inches of rain. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=138.0s)]
*  In New York's Hudson Valley, a woman drowned while trying to leave her home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=141.0s)]
*  Here's Orange County Executive Stephen Newhouse. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=145.0s)]
*  There's some major flash flood, major washouts were all around her houses. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=148.0s)]
*  So I could definitely see where she was trying to get out to safety, but did not make it, got swept away and unfortunately did not make it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=153.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service says heavy rainfall is now impacting New England, which could lead to flooding not seen in the area since Irene. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=161.0s)]
*  Marie Andrusiewicz, NPR News. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=169.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, excessive heat warnings are in effect in large swaths of the south today from Southern California to Florida. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=171.0s)]
*  Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are being warned and the central plains are also being cautioned. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=178.0s)]
*  Heat indices there could soar to 110 degrees. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=184.0s)]
*  It's NPR. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXDUIGvjGcg&t=188.0s)]
