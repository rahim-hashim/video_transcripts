*  The U.S. is rejecting calls by two Israeli leaders for the resettlement of Palestinians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=0.0s)]
*  outside Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=4.98s)]
*  And New York City is barring buses of migrants from entering the city without notice. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=6.5600000000000005s)]

*  Law-right Israeli ministers Betzalel Smotrich and Itamir Ben-Govir have said in recent days [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=25.12s)]
*  the Palestinians in Gaza should be resettled outside the enclave. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=31.64s)]
*  Now U.S. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller has issued a statement calling that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=35.64s)]
*  rhetoric inflammatory and irresponsible. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=39.88s)]

*  32 hours notice to city officials and sets limits on the times and places that buses [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=159.32s)]
*  can arrive. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=165.39999999999998s)]

*  order. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWKlqt1hUo&t=184.51999999999998s)]
