# Trump Continues To Float The Idea Of Serving A 3rd Term | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo)
*  Officials in Myanmar say more than 1,700 people have been killed from the earthquake that struck the country last Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=0.0s)]
*  And President Trump continues to float the idea of serving a third term in the White House. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=6.32s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=11.44s)]
*  The military-led government in Myanmar says more than 1,700 people have been killed by the mammoth earthquake that hit the country last Friday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=15.76s)]
*  Information is scarce. The quakes epicenter was near the huge city of Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=23.919999999999998s)]
*  Michael Sullivan reports from neighboring Thailand that pictures coming out of Mandalay are awful. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=30.32s)]
*  And those pictures show many parts of the city of 1.5 million in ruins. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=35.92s)]
*  And efforts to free those trapped under the rubble have been hampered by a lack of heavy equipment and personnel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=41.2s)]
*  And time is running short for finding more survivors, especially with the temperature hovering near 100 degrees. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=47.6s)]
*  The smell of death, rescue workers say, is overpowering. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  Michael Sullivan reporting. The quake also caused damage in Thailand hundreds of miles away. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=56.0s)]
*  At least 18 people there were killed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  President Trump is floating the idea of potentially serving a third term in the White House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  But NPR's Tamara Keith reports the U.S. Constitution says no one can be elected more than twice to the office of the presidency. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=68.64s)]
*  The way he talks about a third term, it's like he's keeping his options open. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=75.84s)]
*  He also said it is still quite early to be having these conversations. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=80.16s)]
*  The 22nd Amendment bars a president from being elected to a third term. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  But there are some novel legal theories that have been floated. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=88.88s)]
*  And while they are quite far fetched, the fact that Trump isn't dismissing it out of hand means it can't be ignored. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=92.72s)]
*  NPR's Tamara Keith reporting. Trump's close ally, billionaire Elon Musk, spoke last night in Wisconsin. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=99.6s)]
*  He's trying to boost turnout in the state's Supreme Court election set for tomorrow. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=105.92s)]
*  From Member Station WUWM, Chuck Kornbach reports, Musk is opposing the liberal candidate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=110.56s)]
*  Musk contends if Circuit Judge Susan Crawford wins the election, liberals will keep control of the court. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  Then new congressional district maps favorable to Democrats would be drawn for two Wisconsin House seats held by Republicans. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=122.88s)]
*  He says that would help Democrats gain control of the House next year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=131.28s)]
*  And block Trump administration programs. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=135.44s)]
*  It's obviously important in the state of Wisconsin, but I think it could actually be important for the country as well and maybe for the world. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=138.32s)]
*  Musk and groups he supports have spent about $20 million helping Circuit Judge Brad Schimel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=145.28s)]
*  Crawford says Schimel is for sale and that she's made no promises about redrawing House seats. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Chuck Kornbach in Green Bay, Wisconsin. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=158.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, media reports say Elon Musk is scheduled to visit the CIA today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=162.32s)]
*  The billionaire is in charge of President Trump's cost-cutting effort, Doge. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  Musk is expected to meet CIA Director John Radcliffe to discuss efficiency. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=171.76s)]
*  Two congressional special elections in Florida will be held this week. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  The races have garnered national attention. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=181.68s)]
*  The Democratic candidates have raised a lot of money. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=184.16s)]
*  From member station WFSU Tristan Wood reports, the outcomes could narrow the partisan gap in Congress. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=187.28s)]
*  The Democrats running in Florida's first and sixth congressional districts have raised over $15 million. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=194.72s)]
*  While the Republicans have only raised a combined $3 million. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=201.76s)]
*  Despite that gap, political watchers still view both races as a long shot for Democrats. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=204.88s)]
*  Both seats went to the GOP by over 30 points in 2024. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=210.56s)]
*  That hasn't kept Democrats in those districts discouraged though, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=214.72s)]
*  as their voters are only a few thousand early votes behind Republicans despite a significant registration gap. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=218.32s)]
*  There are currently 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats in the U.S. House. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  But four seats are vacant. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=230.32s)]
*  If the Democrats pull off a surprising upset, it could better position them as the minority party in Congress for the next two years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=232.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Tristan Wood in Tallahassee. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  A French court has convicted far-right leader Marine Le Pen of embezzling European Union funds. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=242.32s)]
*  The ruling has major implications for her political future. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=247.92s)]
*  As NPR's Rebecca Rossman reports, a judge has now barred Le Pen from seeking public office for five years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=251.2s)]
*  Le Pen has long been a dominant figure in French politics as longtime leader of the nationalist anti-immigration National Rally Party. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=257.68s)]
*  But this conviction stems from accusations that she misused millions of dollars in EU funds [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=266.08s)]
*  to pay party staff while serving as a member of the European Parliament. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=271.52s)]
*  She denies wrongdoing and plans to appeal, but the ruling remains in effect, likely barring her from the 2027 presidential race. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=276.24s)]
*  Rebecca Rossman, NPR News, Paris. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=284.72s)]
*  Iran's president says his country is rejecting direct talks with the Trump administration over its nuclear weapons program. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=287.36s)]
*  Trump suggested yesterday if there was no progress with Iran on its nuclear program, it might be bombed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=294.56s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader is also rejecting direct talks. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-Ohs9T7Vo&t=304.0s)]
