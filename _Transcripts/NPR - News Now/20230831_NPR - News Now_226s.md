# Johannesburg Building Fire Kills At Least 73 People | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU)
*  Cleanup has started across the southeastern U.S. in the wake of hurricane-turned tropical storm Edalia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=0.0s)]
*  And in Johannesburg, at least 73 people have died in a building fire. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=6.5s)]
*  Good morning, I'm Kristin Wright with NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=11.0s)]
*  Tropical storm Edalia has moved off the Atlantic coast after pounding the Carolinas [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=16.0s)]
*  with heavy downpours and powerful winds. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=21.0s)]
*  As NPR's Bobbi Allen reports, at one point the storm left more than 500,000 customers [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=24.0s)]
*  without power in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=30.0s)]
*  When Edalia bore down on Florida's Big Bend region with 125 mile per hour winds, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=33.5s)]
*  it ripped homes off their foundation and blanketed the rural area with lashing winds and torrential rain. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=38.0s)]
*  But the storm at its peak strength moved through the remote Woodsy swath of Florida, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=43.5s)]
*  avoiding more populated areas like Tallahassee. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=48.0s)]
*  The storm's worst-case scenario never came to pass. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=51.0s)]
*  As Edalia tore eastward, it pounded Georgia and the Carolinas with wind and rain, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=54.0s)]
*  raising the specter of dangerous storm surge and flooding. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=58.5s)]
*  That's something officials are still keeping an eye on. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=61.5s)]
*  But the big focus now is restoring electricity to the hundreds of thousands left in the dark [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=64.0s)]
*  by the storm decimating power lines and other parts of electricity great across the southeast. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=68.0s)]

*  The building is reported to have been previously abandoned and later reoccupied by homeless people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1oDqF3bVfU&t=96.0s)]
