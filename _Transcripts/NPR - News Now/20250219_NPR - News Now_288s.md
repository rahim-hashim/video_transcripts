# After U.S.-Russian Talks, Trump Blames Invasion On Ukraine | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8)
*  President Trump says Ukraine is to blame for prolonging Russia's invasion and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=0.0s)]
*  Kashpatel's nomination to be the next director of the FBI cleared a key procedural hurdle yesterday in the Senate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=4.84s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Top U.S. and Russian diplomats have held their most direct conversations in years yesterday in Saudi Arabia [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=15.9s)]
*  focusing on the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=22.28s)]
*  President Trump is blaming Ukraine for prolonging the war and for failing to surrender territory to Russia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=24.24s)]
*  Trump is suggesting Ukrainian officials don't deserve to be present at any talks regarding peace in their country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=30.52s)]
*  And I think I have the power to end this war and I think it's going very well. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=36.92s)]
*  But today I heard, oh well we weren't invited. Well, you've been there for three years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  You should have ended it three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=45.12s)]
*  I could have made a deal for Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=49.36s)]
*  To be clear, Ukraine did not start the war. Three years ago, Russia launched a surprise, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=51.6s)]
*  full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has been bombing it ever since. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  The Senate is moving closer to a final confirmation vote on Kash Patel to be the FBI director. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  NPR's Giles Snyder tells us about the vote late yesterday that advanced Patel's nomination. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=69.36s)]
*  Kash Patel's nomination to lead the FBI cleared a key procedural hurdle on a 48 to 45 party line vote, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=75.0s)]
*  keeping him on track to head the nation's most prominent law enforcement agency. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=82.88s)]
*  Patel is one of President Trump's most controversial nominees. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=87.36s)]
*  He is a Trump loyalist who worked as an intelligence and defense department official during Trump's first term. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=90.6s)]
*  A loud critic of the FBI, Patel has proposed closing the bureau's headquarters and turning it into a museum for the deep state. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=96.96s)]
*  Democrats say Patel is unfit to lead the FBI. During his confirmation hearing, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=104.6s)]
*  he sought to put to rest concerns about his independence from Trump, saying he wants to reform the FBI. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=109.36s)]
*  A final confirmation vote is expected later this week. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=115.24s)]
*  Giles Snyder, NPR News. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=118.88s)]
*  A group of privacy watchdogs and unions is suing billionaire Elon Musk and his Doge entity [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=120.88s)]
*  from getting access to the private information of taxpayers at the IRS. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=127.16s)]
*  They say this information has special privacy protections that are guaranteed under federal law. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  The Doge team is also said to be looking at records at the Social Security Administration. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley says the Trump administration claims that funding there is being misspent. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=143.92s)]
*  Broad does happen, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  but the agency's own inspector general combed through seven years of records and found less than 1% of payments were made in error. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=150.88s)]
*  But as with tax records, Social Security has a lot of people's sensitive personal information on file and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=158.36s)]
*  privacy advocates recoil at the idea of Elon Musk's deputies digging through that data without a lot of guardrails. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=164.12s)]
*  NPR's Scott Horsley reporting. President Trump has signed an executive order on in vitro fertilization or IVF. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Selena Simmons Duffin reports the goal of the order is to lower costs for patients. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=177.68s)]
*  In vitro fertilization or IVF is a process that can cost around [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=183.0s)]
*  $20,000 or more. On the campaign trail, President Trump promised that it would be free, either paid for by insurance companies or the government. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=187.64s)]
*  On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order that doesn't change policy right away. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=196.16s)]
*  It asks for officials to propose policy ideas that could bring IVF costs down. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=199.88s)]
*  His supporters praised the move saying it was a campaign promise kept. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=205.16s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers called it a PR stunt since Republicans shot down laws to protect access to IVF. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=209.56s)]
*  Some anti-abortion rights commentators also criticized the move, calling IVF immoral. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=215.56s)]
*  Selena Simmons Duffin, NPR News. The measles outbreak in West Texas continues with confirmed cases more than doubling over the past week. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=221.24s)]
*  From member station KTTZ in Lubbock, Texas, Samantha Larned reports there are nearly 60 measles cases spread across five Texas counties. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=229.8s)]
*  The measles outbreak was originally identified in rural Gaines County along Texas border with New Mexico. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=239.88s)]
*  Dr. Ron Cook is the public health authority with the city of Lubbock. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=246.16s)]
*  With cases on the rise, including at least four among vaccinated individuals, he says the focus is on containing the outbreak. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=249.76s)]
*  Right now, it's based on exposure and they're not knowing that you had measles or ever been vaccinated. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=256.68s)]
*  If this thing were to really get carried away, then we would offer booster doses for many different people. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=262.6s)]
*  Cook says that the state of Texas has vaccine reserves on hand if the measles outbreak continues spreading. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=269.12s)]
*  For now, cases are expected to rise as more people get tested. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=275.48s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Samantha Larned in Lubbock. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=279.44s)]
*  You're listening to NPR News from Washington. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X0vk0NTFk8&t=283.12s)]
