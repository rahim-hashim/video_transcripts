# Alaska Airlines Jet's Missing Piece Found In Oregon | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs)
*  Good morning. Today is Monday, January 8th. I'm Korava Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=0.0s)]
*  The National Transportation Safety Board says investigators have found part of the fuselage that blew off a passenger jet on Friday night. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=6.0s)]
*  It had just taken off from Portland, Oregon. NPR's Dave Mistich tells us the Alaska Airlines jet safely returned to the airport. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=15.0s)]
*  NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy says the plane involved in the incident had a warning light go off on three earlier flights [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=23.0s)]
*  that could have indicated pressurization issues. Alaska Airlines then decided to restrict the aircraft from long flights over water. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=28.0s)]
*  Homendy says investigators also found the cockpit voice recorder, but that no data could be retrieved. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=35.0s)]
*  It had been overwritten because it was not recovered within two hours. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=41.0s)]
*  NPR's Dave Mistich reporting. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin remains hospitalized in the Washington, D.C. area for an undisclosed medical condition, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=45.0s)]
*  but he didn't tell President Biden about this or Congress or his deputy for several days. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=54.0s)]
*  Austin released a statement yesterday saying he could have done a better job keeping people informed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=60.0s)]
*  While fighting continues in Gaza, Israel is also looking northward to a possible new front in the war, this time against Hamas allies in Lebanon. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=65.0s)]
*  NPR's Lauren Freyer reports there's been an increased volley of rockets and airstrikes across the Israel-Lebanon border in recent days. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=74.0s)]
*  Israel says Hezbollah rockets hit a sensitive surveillance post in northern Israel and that an anti-tank missile landed in an Israeli border town. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=82.0s)]
*  That's where Igor Potapov lives and has refused to evacuate. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=91.0s)]
*  We need to keep our life. We don't go anywhere. We'll stay here and we will be strong. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=96.0s)]
*  Most of his neighbors have fled south and are staying in hotels paid for by the Israeli government. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=102.0s)]
*  In response to the Hezbollah strikes, the Israeli military says its fighter jets attacked what it called terrorist infrastructures inside Lebanon. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=107.0s)]
*  The prospect of all-out war on Israel's northern border is something U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been warning against on a trip to the region. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=116.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News in northern Israel near the Lebanon border. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=124.0s)]
*  Russia fired 59 missiles and drones at Ukraine today. Ukrainian officials say that four people were killed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=128.0s)]
*  Some of the targets in Ukraine included critical infrastructure and residential areas. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=136.0s)]
*  Congressional leaders and the White House have made a deal to fund the federal government. NPR's Mara Liason has more. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=141.0s)]
*  President Biden hailed the deal, saying it will help prevent a needless government shutdown. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=148.0s)]
*  The deal sticks to the overall funding levels agreed to by the president and former speaker Kevin McCarthy last year. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=153.0s)]
*  Far-right Republicans didn't like that deal at all and it cost McCarthy his job. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=160.0s)]
*  It's not clear whether the new speaker, Mike Johnson, will fare any better. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=165.0s)]
*  The Freedom Caucus calls the deal a total failure and is still demanding deeper spending cuts and new immigration restrictions in exchange for their support. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=169.0s)]
*  Mara Liason, NPR News. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=178.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD8FloNDcfs&t=180.0s)]
