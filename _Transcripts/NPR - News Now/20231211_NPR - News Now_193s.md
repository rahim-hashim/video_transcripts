# Recovery Underway After Tornadoes Kill 6, Injure Dozens In Tennessee | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM)
*  The WHO convened a special session over the weekend to discuss the crisis in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=0.0s)]
*  And a swarm of tornadoes plowed through middle Tennessee over the weekend, killing six people, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=4.88s)]
*  including a child. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  I'm Krova Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  The Israeli military says its troops are engaging in battles with Hamas militants in the two [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=15.8s)]
*  largest cities in Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Israeli officials say that 117 hostages taken by Hamas are still alive in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=22.76s)]
*  Another 20 have been declared dead. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=29.32s)]
*  Israel says it launched a rescue operation last Friday, but that it failed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  Two Israeli soldiers were severely wounded in the operation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=35.92s)]
*  Hamas says an Israeli hostage was killed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=39.64s)]
*  Israel confirms this, but did not disclose if the hostage died in the attempted rescue. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=42.68s)]
*  The World Health Organization has convened a special session this weekend to discuss [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=48.28s)]
*  the deepening crisis in Gaza. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=52.38s)]
*  The meeting came at the urgent request of 17 countries. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=54.46s)]
*  As NPR's Ari Daniel reports, a resolution to protect health care in the Palestinian [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=58.28s)]
*  enclave was adopted without objection. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=63.28s)]
*  The resolution called for the unfettered movement of humanitarian and medical aid and funding [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  to support the WHO's efforts in the Palestinian territories. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=71.58s)]
*  Director General Tedros Adunom Ghebreyusis praised the resolution, but highlighted the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=76.16s)]
*  challenge of enacting it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=80.62s)]
*  Without a ceasefire, sustained humanitarian assistance at the scale needed is simply not [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=82.32s)]
*  possible. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN questioned why today's special session was held, the first [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  to address the subject of a single conflict. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=94.55999999999999s)]
*  She said different rules apply to Israel, but ultimately didn't stand in the way of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=97.28s)]
*  the resolution's adoption. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  Many countries support a ceasefire, but not the US delegation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=103.24s)]
*  Ari Daniel, NPR News. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  In the US, federal prosecutors are urging a judge to keep the March trial date in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=108.76s)]
*  election interference case against former President Donald Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=113.5s)]
*  But NPR's Carrie Johnson reports Trump wants to pause that case while he appeals a key [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=117.48s)]
*  ruling. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=122.36s)]
*  Trump's lawyers are asking an appeals court to find he's immune from prosecution on conspiracy [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=123.36s)]
*  charges because he was president during most of the alleged election interference. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=128.0s)]
*  They want to delay the D.C. trial until after the 2024 election. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=133.06s)]
*  But special counsel prosecutors say there's no need to pause the rest of the pretrial [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=137.48s)]
*  action while the appeal proceeds. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Prosecutors say there's a significant public interest in the trial and they'll commit to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=145.28s)]
*  following their own deadlines even if Trump tries to delay. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=149.44s)]
*  Carrie Johnson, NPR News. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=154.12s)]
*  Some people in Middle Tennessee are still in shelters following this weekend's swarm [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=156.33999999999997s)]
*  of tornadoes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  Several plowed through the state, killing six people, including a child. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  One of the strongest tornadoes passed through Clarksville, northwest of Nashville. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=166.32s)]
*  That is where Luke Dill lives. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  I look up in the sky and the entire sky across the street is just spinning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  And I'm looking at it and the wind is picking up. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  I can see the debris starting to fly and it just started coming down. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=179.2s)]
*  Several Tennessee schools are closed today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3is9pknGDjM&t=182.84s)]
