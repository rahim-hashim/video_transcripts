# Judge Rules College Protest Leader Can't Be Deported | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0)
*  The Canadian province of Ontario is putting 25 percent tariffs on its energy exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=0.0s)]
*  And a federal judge has ruled that a college protest leader arrested by ICE agents over the weekend cannot be deported. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=7.76s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=14.56s)]
*  It'll be a nail-biter in the House today. Republicans are putting up their government spending plan for a vote. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=19.52s)]
*  The GOP majority is so tight, they can likely only afford to lose one vote. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=25.12s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson is confident the bill will pass. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=29.92s)]
*  I believe that the policies that we're putting forth are going to improve the economy and bring down costs for people. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=32.72s)]
*  It takes a little while. We're in a transition period. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  But he won't have help from Democrats, says House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=40.32s)]
*  It is not something we could ever support. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=44.96s)]
*  House Democrats will not be complicit in the Republican effort to hurt the American people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=50.24s)]
*  If the spending bill passes, it goes to the Senate, where it may face more difficulties. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=59.52s)]
*  Congress only has until Friday to pass spending legislation, or the federal government will partially shut down. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=64.56s)]
*  Stocks on Wall Street took a huge plunge yesterday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 4 percent. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=71.12s)]
*  NPR's Maria Aspin says investors are bewildered by President Trump's erratic use of tariffs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=80.48s)]
*  President Trump has done and said a lot of different things about tariffs in the past week, and investors have been feeling the whiplash. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Trump's new 25 percent taxes on imports from Canada and Mexico went into effect last week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=94.16s)]
*  Then he started giving out reprieves, first to automakers, then to Mexico, then to Canada. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=99.6s)]
*  But the fact that Trump actually let the tariffs go into effect was a big deal and showed they might be more than just a negotiating tactic. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  NPR's Maria Aspin reporting. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Canadian province of Ontario isn't waiting for President Trump to make up his mind. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=114.48s)]
*  The province is slapping its own 25 percent tariff on provincial energy exports to New York, Minnesota and Michigan. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=119.76s)]
*  For Member Station WSKG, Rebecca Rettelmeyer reports some local officials are demanding an end to the escalating trade war. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=128.24s)]
*  Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he is retaliating against President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on some Canadian exports. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=136.24s)]
*  Until these tariffs are off the table, until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario will not relent. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=144.24s)]
*  Ford said the energy surcharge will add an average of $70 per month to the energy bills of 1.5 million American homes and businesses. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  In response, New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer released a statement urging Trump to immediately rescind his tariff threats. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=161.52s)]
*  Both Democrats voice concern the tariffs will drive up Americans utility bills. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=170.8s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Rebecca Rettelmeyer in Ithaca, New York. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=175.68s)]
*  NASA has laid off its chief scientist. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=179.52s)]
*  As NPR's Jeff Brumfield reports, her position was deemed redundant as part of larger staffing cuts at the space agency. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=182.24s)]
*  Dr. Kate Calvin had served as NASA's chief scientist since 2022. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Her job was to advise senior leadership on the space agency's many scientific missions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=194.64s)]
*  She also served as the agency's senior advisor on climate change and was a leading government climate scientist. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  Calvin was one of 23 employees at NASA who lost their jobs, according to a statement from the agency. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=205.76000000000002s)]

*  The space agency says it plans more layoffs in the near future to comply with an executive order from President Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=215.36s)]

*  They're discussing ways to end the war with Russia. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=230.16s)]
*  This comes after a tense on-camera meeting between President Trump and Ukraine's president more than a week ago in the Oval Office. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=232.88s)]

*  the most important thing is to leave with a strong sense Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=245.6s)]
*  like he says the Russians will have to do in order to end the war. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlF1X4FKxh0&t=250.96s)]
