# Millions Without Power As Milton Pulls Away From Florida | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE)
*  Hurricane Milton has left more than a quarter of Florida's electric customers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=0.0s)]
*  without power this morning, and Oklahoma will no longer require Bibles in its [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  public schools to also include copies of the U.S. Constitution. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=8.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=12.44s)]
*  And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=14.88s)]
*  Hurricane Milton is pulling away from Florida's East Coast, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=16.72s)]
*  dragging heavy rain with it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=19.6s)]
*  At first light, there are reports of catastrophic damage [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=21.6s)]
*  from the state's Gulf Coast to the Atlantic Ocean. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=24.76s)]
*  Milton made landfall last night, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=27.52s)]
*  south of Tampa, with top sustained winds of 125 miles per hour, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=29.08s)]
*  triggering feet of storm surge and flash flooding. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=33.32s)]
*  About a quarter of all customers in Florida are out of power. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=36.4s)]
*  Tampa Mayor Jane Castor says although the hurricane has passed, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=40.08s)]
*  the danger is not yet over. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=43.16s)]
*  Please don't go outside. Definitely don't drive around. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Don't go through standing water and make sure if you see any trees or wires [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=49.16s)]
*  down, call and report those and we will get them fixed as quickly [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=54.16s)]
*  as we can. Just to the west of Tampa, the sheriff of Pinellas County says [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=58.8s)]
*  all access points to that county are closed, effective immediately. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=63.4s)]
*  The county is home to the city of St. Petersburg. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=67.96s)]
*  The Pinellas County Sheriff is citing hazardous storm conditions. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  City officials say the hurricane also heavily damaged the roof of the stadium [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=74.92s)]
*  used by a major league baseball team. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=78.96s)]
*  From member station WUSF, Kathy Carter reports the stadium was being used [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=81.64s)]
*  as a staging area for thousands of first responders and utility workers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=86.72s)]
*  Home of the Tampa Bay Rays, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=91.16s)]
*  Tropicana Field's iconic dome was designed to withstand 115 mile an hour winds, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=92.64s)]
*  but it could not withstand Milton's constant high winds. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=98.96s)]
*  Since the race season is over, it will have no immediate impact on baseball. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  The storm also brought down a massive construction crane, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=107.56s)]
*  which collapsed into the city's newest downtown high rise. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  No injuries have been reported in either incident. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=114.36s)]
*  City officials are urging the public to stay sheltered in place [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=117.52s)]
*  and avoid both areas until announced otherwise. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=121.4s)]
*  Overnight, St. Petersburg officials cut off the city's potable drinking water [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=125.0s)]
*  source because of a major water main break. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=129.28s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Kathy Carter. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=132.32s)]
*  The state of Oklahoma has altered its requirements for the fifty five [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=135.16s)]
*  thousand Bibles it's purchasing for public school classrooms. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=139.52s)]
*  The change follows criticism of a version of the Bible [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  endorsed by former President Donald Trump. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  NPR's Jason Rhodes has more. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=149.84s)]
*  The initial requirements included not only the King James version of the Bible, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=152.4s)]
*  but also the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=156.24s)]
*  among other founding documents from US history. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  Also, the volume had to be bound in leather or leather like material. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=163.28000000000003s)]
*  Critics pointed out that one of the few Bibles that met those requirements [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=167.12s)]
*  was the God Bless the USA Bible endorsed by Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=170.72s)]
*  Financial disclosure documents show Trump received three hundred [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  thousand dollars to promote that Bible. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=177.8s)]
*  Now, the amended purchase forms from Oklahoma no longer require [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=180.36s)]
*  the historical American documents be included with the Bible itself. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=184.24s)]
*  Jason DeRose, NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOJbWnEVKE&t=188.72s)]
