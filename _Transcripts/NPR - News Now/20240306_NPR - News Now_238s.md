# Haley Suspends Her Campaign For The White House | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM)
*  Good morning. It's Wednesday, March 6th. I'm Korova Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley will suspend her campaign for the White House today, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=6.2s)]
*  according to sources familiar with the matter. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=11.1s)]
*  Her campaign says she will give remarks later this morning in Charleston, South Carolina, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=13.4s)]
*  where she's expected to withdraw. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Haley won only one state in yesterday's Super Tuesday Contests, and that was Vermont. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=19.8s)]
*  NPR's Sarah McCammon has this look at Haley's campaign. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=25.2s)]
*  Nikki Haley hung on through multiple losses to Donald Trump, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=28.6s)]
*  arguing most voters did not want a rematch between Trump or President Biden in November. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=32.0s)]
*  She touted her experience as a former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=37.6s)]
*  and highlighted her relative youth, calling for mental competency tests for politicians over 75. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=42.6s)]
*  Heading into her home state's primary in late February, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=49.0s)]
*  Haley pledged to continue fighting until the last person votes, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=52.2s)]
*  but later said she meant until every South Carolinian had cast a ballot. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=56.1s)]
*  Haley won a historic victory on March 3rd, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=60.6s)]
*  becoming the first woman to win a Republican primary when she defeated Trump in the District of Columbia. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=63.3s)]
*  But she ultimately failed to gain enough support to take on Trump nationwide. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=69.5s)]
*  Sarah McCammon, NPR News. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=74.0s)]
*  President Biden and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump dominated Super Tuesday voting, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=75.7s)]
*  but NPR's Giles Snyder reports that presidential contests were just the main event. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=80.5s)]
*  Joe Biden and Donald Trump were the focus of Super Tuesday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=85.5s)]
*  Biden dominated the Democratic primaries. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=88.9s)]
*  Trump easily won most of his, but he failed to achieve a clean sweep. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=91.8s)]
*  Republican challenger Nikki Haley pulled out a win in Vermont. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=95.7s)]
*  The party presidential contests weren't the only races voters decided. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=99.0s)]
*  In California, Congressman Adam Schiff will face off against Republican Steve Garvey [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=102.9s)]
*  for the late Dianne Feinstein Senate seat. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=108.0s)]
*  And primaries for all 52 of California's U.S. House seats were decided, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=110.8s)]
*  with the resulting matchups in November helping to determine control of Congress. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=115.5s)]
*  In fact, there were primaries around the country for 115 of the House's 438 seats. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=119.7s)]
*  Giles Snyder, NPR News. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=126.5s)]
*  Another key congressional race is in Alabama's newly redrawn Second District. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=128.1s)]
*  There will be runoff races between two Democrats and two Republicans [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=132.9s)]
*  to determine which candidates will meet in November's general election. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  NPR's Stephen Fowler says that outcome could help determine [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  which party controls the House of Representatives next year. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=144.5s)]
*  At the national level, this is a district that is likely to go for a Democrat in November. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  It's held by a Republican now, and so with a razor-thin U.S. House margin, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=153.2s)]
*  every seat counts for determining who gets the majority. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=158.6s)]
*  In Alabama, though, it's important because this district was created under a court order [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=161.9s)]
*  to be a second majority black or near majority black district. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=167.9s)]
*  So Alabama voters in South Alabama, Black Alabama voters, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  now have the opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=175.8s)]
*  NPR's Stephen Fowler, a Brazilian scientist turned singer-songwriter, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=179.3s)]
*  has won this year's Dance Your PhD contest. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=184.0s)]
*  It's a competition where researchers are asked to explain their work through dance. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=188.0s)]
*  Ari Daniel has more. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=192.4s)]
*  Welaton Minario Costa says his first-place finish, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  earned from his entry about kangaroo personalities, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  was like winning the Eurovision Song Contest. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=201.0s)]
*  Costa's entry, from his PhD at Australian National University, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  opens with all kinds of dancers rocking out on an open landscape [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=214.9s)]
*  to illustrate that kangaroos have different personalities. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=219.3s)]
*  Costa says the dance doubles as a celebration of his own identity [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=222.9s)]
*  as a queer immigrant and artist, one he's come to embrace during his time living abroad. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=226.9s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Ari Daniel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=232.3s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman, NPR News. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Crl7t68UM&t=234.9s)]
