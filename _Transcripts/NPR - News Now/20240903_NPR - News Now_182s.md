# Amid Protests, Netanyahu Holds Firm On Cease-Fire Deal | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A)
*  Live from NPR News on Korva Coleman, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will not give way to pressure to reach a ceasefire deal with Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=0.0s)]
*  There were huge protests and a labor strike yesterday in Israel. Protesters want Netanyahu to quit and sign a deal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=9.0s)]
*  The Israeli military has retrieved the bodies of six hostages abducted and killed by Hamas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=15.0s)]
*  President Biden said yesterday Netanyahu isn't doing enough to free the hostages. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=21.0s)]
*  Netanyahu says the pressure should be on Hamas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=25.0s)]
*  I don't believe that either President Biden or anyone serious about achieving peace and achieving the release would seriously ask Israel, Israel to make these concessions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=31.0s)]
*  Hamas still holds 101 hostages in Gaza. 30 of them are believed to be dead. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=43.0s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry says Israeli strikes since the war started have killed well over 40,000 Palestinians. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=49.0s)]
*  More than 94,000 Palestinians have been injured. Many of them are women and children. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=56.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Britain's chief rabbi has criticized his government's decision to suspend some arms exports to Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=61.0s)]
*  The British foreign secretary announced the suspension last night. NPR's Lauren Freyer reports from London. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=68.0s)]
*  Britain's chief rabbi Efra Mervis said on social media that, quote, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=73.0s)]
*  it beggars belief that Israel's ally Britain is suspending some arms exports and doing it at a time when funerals are ongoing for Israeli hostages killed in Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=78.0s)]
*  UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told Parliament he had no choice after a legal review showed British-made weapons could be used by Israel in a way that violates international law. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=87.0s)]
*  Israel denies its war in Gaza violates any law. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=98.0s)]
*  UK Defense Minister John Healey says it won't have much material effect anyway. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=101.0s)]
*  The UK exports only a small number of weapons to Israel. It's suspending less than 10 percent of export licenses. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=106.0s)]
*  Lauren Freyer, NPR News, London. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=113.0s)]
*  In the US, the high cost of housing is a key issue for many voters this election season. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=115.0s)]
*  NPR's Jennifer Ludden has more on what former President Donald Trump says he'd do about it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=121.0s)]
*  Trump says deporting immigrants would free up housing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=126.0s)]
*  But housing experts warn that could hurt badly needed new construction, which relies on immigrant labor. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=129.0s)]
*  As for affordable housing, while in office, Trump opposed building more and even funding what exists. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=135.0s)]
*  Seamus Roller heads the National Housing Law Project. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=141.0s)]
*  There were significant cuts to the federal housing programs proposed under Trump, and I would expect to see similar cuts proposed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=144.0s)]
*  It really depends on what Congress looks like as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=152.0s)]
*  Trump says he'd make it cheaper to buy a house because he'd bring down interest rates. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=155.0s)]
*  But that power lies with the Federal Reserve, not the president. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=159.0s)]
*  Jennifer Ludden, NPR News, Washington. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=163.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris is promising to offer incentives to build three million new homes over four years. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=165.0s)]
*  But critics warn Congress must fund that proposal and states and local governments control zoning. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=171.0s)]
*  This is NPR. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bN4OT-H-8A&t=177.0s)]
