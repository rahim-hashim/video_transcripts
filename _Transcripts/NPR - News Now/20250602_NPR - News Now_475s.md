# 8 People Set On Fire In Attack In Boulder, Colo. | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys)
*  Eight people were set on fire at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=0.0s)]
*  And Ukraine struck Russian military air bases this weekend with a shocking barrage of drones [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  ahead of today's brief peace talks in Turkey. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=10.84s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=14.08s)]
*  I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=15.08s)]
*  The FBI is investigating an attack in Boulder, Colorado as terrorism. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=18.3s)]
*  Authorities say eight people were set on fire at an outdoor mall yesterday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=22.72s)]
*  From member station KUNC, Emma Vanden Heinty reports a suspect has been arrested. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=26.84s)]
*  Local FBI officials identified the male suspect as 45-year-old Mohammed Sabri Salomon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=31.96s)]
*  He used a makeshift flamethrower and threw it at a crowd. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=37.72s)]
*  Boulder County District Attorney Michael Doherty says the list of mass attacks in Colorado [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=41.04s)]
*  is too long. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=45.68s)]
*  But from those experiences, we have forged really strong working relationships and ensuring [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=46.68s)]
*  that we do everything possible, everything we can do and need to do, to secure justice [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=50.36s)]
*  for the victims, their family members and the Boulder community. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=54.6s)]
*  Officials say the suspect yelled, Free Palestine, during a march in support of releasing Israeli [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=59.18s)]
*  hostages held by Hamas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  They believe he acted alone. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=66.08s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Emma Vanden Heinty in Denver. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=67.88s)]
*  Representatives from Ukraine and Russia are meeting for direct peace talks in Istanbul, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=71.36s)]
*  Turkey. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=75.28s)]
*  This is their second set of direct talks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=76.28s)]
*  The first set ended inconclusively. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=78.32s)]
*  This time, both sides are set to exchange written proposals for peace. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=80.74s)]
*  NPR's Charles Mains reports this comes as Ukraine says it successfully struck Russian [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=84.58s)]
*  military air bases yesterday. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=89.58s)]
*  Ukraine smuggled remotely operated drones laden with explosives deep into Russia. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=92.5s)]
*  And by deep, I mean deep. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=97.1s)]
*  Up into the Arctic, also into Siberia, some 2,700 miles away. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=98.66s)]
*  Now, they did this by hiding the drones in the tops of flatbed trucks, which then parked [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=102.58s)]
*  near military bases before lifting off to attack planes on the runway. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=107.46s)]
*  NPR's Charles Mains reporting Ukraine claims it destroyed more than 40 Russian planes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=111.38s)]
*  Russia downplayed the impact, saying only several planes caught fire. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=116.82s)]
*  Russia has also fired nearly 500 drones into Ukraine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=121.02s)]
*  China and the U.S. are accusing each other of violating the trade agreement the two countries [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=124.82s)]
*  reached just last month in Geneva. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=128.78s)]
*  Cherise Pham reports from Hong Kong the clash is threatening to again upend trade relations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=131.78s)]
*  Beijing accused the U.S. of breaching deal terms, signaling that talks between the world's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=137.9s)]
*  top two economies have taken a turn for the worse. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=142.34s)]
*  The trade war between China and the U.S. had been on a hiatus following a trade agreement [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=145.62s)]
*  forged in Geneva that led to a suspension of most tariffs for 90 days. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=150.22s)]
*  But tensions have been rising. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=155.1s)]
*  Last week, the U.S. restricted the sale of semiconductor software to China and said it [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=157.1s)]
*  planned to revoke visas for Chinese students. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=161.6s)]
*  China's Ministry of Commerce said those moves violate the trade agreement. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=165.0s)]
*  The spokesperson added that if the U.S. continues to damage China's interests, China will take [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=168.88s)]
*  forceful measures to safeguard its rights and interests. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=174.16s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Cherise Pham in Hong Kong. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=177.42s)]
*  Traders on Wall Street are watching the renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=180.2s)]
*  President Trump said last Friday he will double U.S. tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=185.22s)]
*  to 50 percent. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=190.44s)]
*  These new 50 percent tariffs are supposed to start on Wednesday. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=192.12s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attended an annual defense forum over the weekend in Singapore. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=196.2s)]
*  In his speech, he warned China that there would be disastrous consequences if it rather [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=201.32s)]
*  invades the democratic island of Taiwan. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=206.16s)]
*  And B.R.'s Emily Feng reports. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=209.36s)]
*  Hegseth issued this warning about potential Chinese military actions around Taiwan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=211.48s)]
*  The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=216.18s)]
*  Hegseth's warning that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could be imminent is one of several [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=220.0s)]
*  often conflicting predictions made by senior American defense officials. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=224.24s)]
*  Admiral Philip Davidson told Congress in 2021 before he retired as head of the Indo-Pacific [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=228.72s)]
*  Command that China might manifest its threats towards Taiwan by 2027, a window his successor, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=233.22s)]
*  Admiral Samuel Papparo and other intelligence agencies have dismissed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  And President Trump said last year while campaigning that he does not think China's Xi Jinping [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=244.58s)]
*  will provoke him over Taiwan because the Chinese leader, quote, knows I am crazy using [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=249.2s)]
*  an expletive. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=254.64s)]
*  Emily Feng, NPR News. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=256.14s)]

*  Cunningham and European Parliament member Rima Hassan. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=278.84s)]
*  In May, another ship launched by the same group was struck and damaged by drones. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=283.4s)]
*  No one claimed responsibility. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=288.44s)]
*  The group accused Israel of the attack. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel blocked food and medicine from reaching Gaza for more than two months. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  Last week, Israel began its more limited aid effort to distribute food under armed guard. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=297.15999999999997s)]

*  food parcels on Sunday. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=306.44s)]
*  Israeli forces fired on them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=309.04s)]
*  Israel says it fired warning shots. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=311.96s)]
*  Jana Raff, NPR News, Amman. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=314.24s)]
*  Heavy wildfires in central and western Canada have forced more than 25,000 people to flee [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=316.88s)]
*  across three provinces. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=322.88s)]
*  Most of the evacuations are in Manitoba. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  That province lies to the north of Minnesota and North Dakota. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=327.76s)]
*  The smoke from the Canadian wildfires is seeping south. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=331.48s)]
*  Most of Minnesota is under an air quality alert today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=335.76000000000005s)]
*  Weather forecasters say this is a long duration event and that there will be multiple rounds [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=339.12s)]
*  of smoke that descend to the south. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=344.36s)]
*  Facebook and Instagram owner Metta is planning to automate efforts to review its products [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=346.88s)]
*  for risks, including to the privacy of users. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  As NPR's Shannon Bond reports, Metta is moving some work toward artificial intelligence rather [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=354.56s)]
*  than relying on humans. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=359.88s)]
*  For years when Metta launched new features and products, human reviewers evaluated possible [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=361.76s)]
*  risks to privacy, to teen users, to the prevalence of toxic content. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=366.24s)]
*  Now the company aims to automate up to 90% of risk assessments using a system powered [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=371.2s)]
*  by artificial intelligence, according to internal documents obtained by NPR. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=376.0s)]
*  The change will allow product developers to release app updates and features more quickly. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=380.68s)]
*  Metta says only quote, low risk decisions are being automated. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=385.2s)]
*  The internal documents reviewed by NPR show that Metta is considering automating reviews [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=389.02s)]
*  for sensitive areas, including AI safety and youth risk. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=393.38s)]

*  trust to address harms from the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  That's when mobs of white people attacked and killed as many as 300 black members of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=412.41999999999996s)]
*  the prosperous neighborhood of Greenwood. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=416.98s)]
*  Tulsa mayor Monroe Nichols says the trust will invest in affordable housing, scholarships [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=419.26s)]
*  and land acquisition. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=424.3s)]
*  This is not the age old battle of black versus white or the more contemporary battle of blue [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=426.54s)]
*  versus red. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=431.82s)]
*  This is about putting those petty divisions and outdated thinking behind us as we press [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=434.32s)]
*  on together. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=439.86s)]
*  The Tulsa mayor also declared yesterday as race massacre observance day. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=441.04s)]

*  The Oklahoma City Thunder will host the Indiana Pacers. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=449.7s)]
*  The Pacers defeated the New York Knicks Saturday to take the Eastern Conference Championship. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=452.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, pro hockey's final opens Wednesday night. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  It's a rematch. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=460.68s)]
*  The Edmonton Oilers will host the Florida Panthers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK9OWnei1ys&t=461.71999999999997s)]
