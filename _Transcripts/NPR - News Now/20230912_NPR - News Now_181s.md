*  Live from NPR News, I'm Giles Snyder. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House is upping the pressure on Congress to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=3.4s)]
*  NPR's Franco Ordonia reports that officials are making a state-by-state case on how they [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=7.84s)]
*  say House Republicans are harming American families. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  House members return this week from their summer recess, and they already face a looming [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=17.36s)]
*  deadline to fund the government by the end of the month, or risk a federal shutdown. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=21.68s)]
*  In a memo released this morning, the White House's Office of Management and Budget Director [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=26.76s)]
*  Shalonda Young accused House Republicans of reneging on a bipartisan budget agreement. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=30.66s)]
*  White House officials say some GOP lawmakers are instead pushing partisan appropriation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=36.36s)]
*  bills. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  The administration is releasing fact sheets from all 50 states stating how it says House [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=42.24s)]
*  Republican plans will quote, gut key investments in the American people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=47.52s)]
*  House conservatives argue the cuts are necessary to address out-of-control spending. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=52.36s)]
*  Franco Ordoniaz, NPR News. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=57.12s)]
*  Moving to the talks between carmakers and the auto workers union. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=59.56s)]
*  If a deal is not struck by Thursday night, some 150,000 auto workers could be on strike [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=63.4s)]
*  come Friday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=69.24s)]
*  This is a fight over pay, benefits and the balance of power between workers and companies [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=70.52s)]
*  and looming over it all is the transition to electric vehicles, as NPR's Kamila Domenoski [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=74.94s)]
*  reports. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=79.92s)]
*  Carmakers and the auto workers agree that the industry is about to build a lot more [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=81.44s)]
*  electric vehicles. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=86.02s)]
*  But the union wants to make sure green jobs of the future are as high paying and secure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=87.72s)]
*  as auto jobs used to be. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=92.4s)]
*  Companies say they can't meet the union's demands in part because of the high cost of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=95.06s)]
*  the EV transition. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=99.68s)]
*  That's also the reason Stellantis gave for closing an assembly plant in Belvedere, Illinois. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=101.52s)]
*  But one former worker there, Patty Ellison, wasn't persuaded. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=106.8s)]
*  It sounds like an excuse to me. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=110.52s)]
*  If they're going to make electric vehicles, why can't we make them there in Belvedere? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFgg1VX-CaQ&t=113.92s)]
