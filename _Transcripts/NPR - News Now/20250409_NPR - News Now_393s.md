# Trade War Escalates As China Hikes Tariffs Another 50% | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM)
*  China has increased its retaliatory terrorists against the United States to 84% today and President Trump has signed executive orders designed to revitalize [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=0.0s)]
*  US coal production. Good morning. I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=9.58s)]
*  President Trump's new terrorists on dozens of countries took effect overnight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=16.12s)]
*  This is on top of the 10% terrorists he imposed on nearly all nations last weekend. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=19.26s)]
*  Trump's boosted his terrorists on China to more than 100%. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=24.32s)]
*  China has just announced that it is boosting its own retaliatory terrorists on the US. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=28.94s)]
*  The Chinese levies will go from about 34% to 84%. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  Trump has been firm on his tariff actions, but NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Levin says Trump's messaging has been mixed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=39.3s)]
*  There were several days there where you'd have one administration official saying these tariffs are not negotiable, that they're going to stick around a while. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=45.46s)]
*  And then you'd have another official saying Trump was open to negotiation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=52.42s)]
*  Yesterday, the White House seemed to have settled on the idea that yes, these tariffs are negotiable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=56.14s)]
*  They've said that about 70 countries have reached out for some sort of talks. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=60.86s)]
*  NPR's Danielle Kurtz-Levin reporting. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=65.06s)]
*  Separately, officials with the European Union are meeting to vote today on European terrorists against the US. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=67.54s)]
*  The first tranche could take effect next week. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=73.42s)]
*  Markets are falling. In pre-market trading, Dow futures are down nearly 700 points. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=76.5s)]
*  The president has signed executive orders designed to revitalize US coal production. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=82.22s)]
*  NPR's Mara Liason reports. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=86.62s)]
*  Standing in front of a group of coal miners wearing work uniforms and hard hats, President Trump signed orders that would remove regulations for new coal mines and expedite leases for coal mining on federal land. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=88.66s)]
*  He said the orders would crush Biden-era environmental restrictions. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=100.22s)]
*  For four long years, Joe Biden and congressional Democrats tried to abolish the American coal industry. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=104.58s)]
*  They did everything in their power. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=110.38000000000001s)]
*  Coal mining's decline began in the 1980s and more recently, it's lost ground to low-cost fracking. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=112.06s)]
*  That's on top of environmental regulation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  As for coal's contribution to climate change, Trump said sea level rise would create, quote, a little bit more waterfront property. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=120.42s)]
*  Mara Liason, NPR News. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=127.94s)]
*  Education Secretary Linda McMahon has made a rare appearance at a conference in San Diego. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  She was asked about changes to her agency. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=135.58s)]
*  That includes recently telling school leaders they have to get rid of DEI programs or risk losing funding for low-income students. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=138.7s)]
*  NPR's Janaki Mehta has more. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=146.86s)]
*  Asked about what exactly the administration meant by DEI programs, here's what Secretary McMahon said. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=149.1s)]
*  We need to continue to focus on where these funds need to be spent, but making sure that we are treating everyone equally. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=155.1s)]
*  We're not taking away the rights of anyone to serve the rights of another. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=163.34s)]
*  There's been confusion around how state and local leaders should respond to the latest threat to pull funding. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=167.38s)]
*  Many say they already follow civil rights laws, including New York and Minnesota's education departments, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=172.5s)]
*  which pushed back against the federal directive saying there is nothing illegal about diversity programs at schools. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=177.82s)]
*  The U.S. Department of Ed has not said how they will enforce the ban on DEI. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=184.18s)]
*  Janaki Mehta, NPR News. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=188.74s)]
*  A federal judge has ruled that the Trump White House must admit the Associated Press's journalists to news events. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=191.1s)]
*  The judge ruled the White House exclusion of the AP over what to call the Gulf of Mexico is unlawful. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=197.3s)]
*  But NPR's David Falkenflick reports two AP journalists were still rejected from the White House pool to cover a Trump speech. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=203.26s)]
*  President Trump and other senior government officials had shut the Associated Press out of dozens of major events at the Oval Office and elsewhere [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=210.66s)]
*  because the news service refused to go along with Trump's decree that the Gulf of Mexico should henceforth be known as the Gulf of America. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=217.58s)]
*  The AP goes by the historic name for the body of water, but no, it's Trump's order. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  Judge Trevor McFadden had seemed skeptical of the AP's arguments last month. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=228.61999999999998s)]
*  In his order, however, he found that the White House actions had harmed the AP's ability to cover the news. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=232.42s)]
*  McFadden, a Trump appointee, wrote, quote, The AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=237.66s)]
*  No comment yet from the White House. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=243.45999999999998s)]

*  Now he's demanding answers from Israel. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=312.22s)]
*  He's 14 years old. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP5TwFbMEOM&t=314.46s)]
