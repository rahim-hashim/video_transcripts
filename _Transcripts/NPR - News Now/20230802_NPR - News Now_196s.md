*  This indictment is the third criminal case against Donald Trump, and may be one of the most serious against the former president. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNy2WdR4SGM&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  This case involves at least six co-conspirators and involves allegations Trump and his allies interfered in a US election in an attempt to cling to power. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNy2WdR4SGM&t=34.64s)]

*  One instruction tells Florida middle school students that some enslaved black people gained skills that could sometimes be used for their personal benefit. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNy2WdR4SGM&t=76.68s)]

*  There is no roundtable, no lecture, no invitation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNy2WdR4SGM&t=90.80000000000001s)]

*  A hotter atmosphere can hold more moisture, so rainstorms can be more intense. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNy2WdR4SGM&t=158.0s)]
*  Global warming primarily comes from humans burning fossil fuels. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNy2WdR4SGM&t=163.8s)]
*  If humans seriously reduce the use of fossil fuels, scientists say the world can avoid more devastating scenarios. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNy2WdR4SGM&t=168.0s)]
