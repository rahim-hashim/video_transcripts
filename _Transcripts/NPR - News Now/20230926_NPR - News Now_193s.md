# Biden To Walk UAW Picket Line In Michigan Today | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRlfHKmfqvE)
*  President Biden will walk a picket line with members of the United Auto Workers today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRlfHKmfqvE&t=0.0s)]

*  Auto Workers helped save the automobile industry when it was crashing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRlfHKmfqvE&t=34.76s)]
*  And I think that now that the industry is roaring back, they should participate in the benefit of that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRlfHKmfqvE&t=38.32s)]
*  Biden's visit comes the day before former President Donald Trump comes to visit Detroit as well. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRlfHKmfqvE&t=47.32s)]

*  Lahaina, it looks like a war zone. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRlfHKmfqvE&t=106.68s)]
*  And we are grieving and there are triggers everywhere and we're not ready for that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRlfHKmfqvE&t=109.96000000000001s)]
