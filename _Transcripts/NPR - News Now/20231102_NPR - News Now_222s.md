# Israeli Attacks On Hamas' Tunnels Put Civilians At Risk | NPR News Now
**NPR - News Now:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8)
*  President Biden is calling for a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=0.0s)]
*  And Colorado Congressman Ken Buck has announced he won't run for re-election next year. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=6.2s)]
*  Good morning. I'm Windsor Johnston with NPR News. And here are today's top stories. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=12.5s)]
*  The Israeli military continues to attack tunnels used by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=18.2s)]
*  NPR's Jackie Northam reports Israel's effort to destroy the underground network is putting civilians at risk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=24.5s)]
*  The Hamas tunnels run for hundreds of miles underneath Gaza and are used by the militants for everything from storing weapons to launching rocket attacks and planning military operations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=32.5s)]
*  Israel is pounding Gaza with airstrikes to eliminate the tunnels, but it's civilians who often pay the price. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=43.0s)]
*  An elite Israeli team has been trained for tunnel combat. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=50.5s)]
*  Daphna Rishaman Barak, an underground warfare expert, says they will have limited communications underground and face booby traps. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=53.5s)]
*  So we're looking at one-on-one combat, which is very different than what modern warfare really is about. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=61.5s)]
*  This is a return to medieval ways of fighting. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=68.5s)]
*  What could further complicate Israel's targeting the tunnels are the nearly 240 hostages being held by a Hamas likely in the tunnels. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=72.0s)]
*  Jackie Northam, NPR News. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=80.0s)]
*  President Biden is once again calling for a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=83.0s)]
*  As Matt Sepick of Minnesota Public Radio reports, the president made the remarks in response to an activist who interrupted him during an event in Minneapolis on Wednesday. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=89.0s)]
*  Biden was speaking to around 200 people at a private fundraiser when Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg got up from her seat and demanded that he pressure Israel to stop its siege of Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=100.0s)]
*  Rosenberg's group, Jewish Voice for Peace, posted video online. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=110.0s)]
*  Mr. President, if you care about Jewish people as a rabbi, I need you to call for a ceasefire right now. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=114.0s)]
*  Get out! [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=121.0s)]
*  The clip did not include Biden's response, but a pool reporter traveling with the president noted that Biden said, quote, I think we need a pause. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=125.0s)]
*  A pause means give time to get the prisoners out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=133.0s)]
*  The president's comments coincided with a large demonstration in support of Palestinian rights about a mile from the event. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=136.0s)]
*  For NPR News, I'm Matt Sepick in Minneapolis. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=142.0s)]
*  Congressman Ken Buck has announced that he will not seek reelection next year. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=145.0s)]
*  Speaking to CNN, the Colorado Republican criticized his colleagues who still refuse to condemn the January 6 insurrection. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=150.0s)]
*  Buck also predicted that his party will look different once the current election cycle is over. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=159.0s)]
*  I don't think Donald Trump will be our next president, and I don't think that the Republicans in the House will be bound to his ideology and to his priorities. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=165.0s)]
*  And I think that will free up a lot of people. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=176.0s)]
*  Buck's announcement came just hours after another veteran House Republican, Kay Granger, confirmed that she also would not seek reelection next year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=179.0s)]
*  The Texas Rangers have won the World Series, beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-0 in Game 5 last night. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=189.0s)]
*  Rangers fan Jonathan Lamar came from Denver to cheer the team on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=197.0s)]
*  A world of emotions. I honestly don't live in Phoenix. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=201.0s)]
*  I live in Denver, flew out here on a whim this morning, knowing this was going to happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=205.0s)]
*  Could not ask for a better ending. Completely ecstatic. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=211.0s)]
*  This is the first World Series title for the Rangers. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=214.0s)]
*  This is NPR News in Washington. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBeWhBdTBf8&t=217.0s)]
