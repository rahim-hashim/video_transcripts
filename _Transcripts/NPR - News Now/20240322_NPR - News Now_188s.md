**NPR - News Now:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0)
*  The House is set to vote today on a trillion-dollar spending package, and a federal appeals court [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=0.0s)]
*  has ordered an investigation into possible bias among the jurors who decided the death [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=5.04s)]
*  penalty case against the Boston Marathon bomber. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=9.68s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=12.32s)]
*  I'm Corva Coleman from NPR News, and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=13.32s)]
*  The House of Representatives is slated to vote today on a $1.2 trillion spending package. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=16.88s)]
*  As NPR's Barbara Sprunch reports, the bills would fund the federal government through [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=22.46s)]
*  the end of this fiscal year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=26.12s)]
*  The package represents the second and final set of bipartisan spending bills for the year. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=28.08s)]
*  It includes defense, homeland security, labor, and state foreign operations. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=33.379999999999995s)]
*  Both Democrats and Republicans have claimed victories in the compromise legislation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=38.599999999999994s)]
*  Republicans point to increased funding for strengthening the southern border, including [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  an increase in the number of agents and ICE detention beds. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=47.5s)]
*  Democrats are touting a $1 billion increase for child care and early learning programs. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=51.36s)]
*  The deadline for Congress to pass the bills is Friday at midnight. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=57.04s)]
*  Once it passes the House, the Senate will take it up, possibly over the weekend. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=61.2s)]
*  Barbara Sprunch, NPR News, The Capitol. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=65.4s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken has returned to Israel for meetings with Israeli leaders. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=68.24s)]
*  He's working on a potential ceasefire in Gaza and trying to secure the release of hostages [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=73.16s)]
*  held by Hamas. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=78.2s)]
*  Blinken is reiterating U.S. opposition to an Israeli plan to stage a major military [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  push into the southern Gaza city of Ra'afe to attack Hamas fighters. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=85.36s)]
*  Hamas can be effectively dealt with without a major ground operation in Ra'afe. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  One of the reasons that we have counterparts from the Israeli government coming to Washington [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  next week is precisely to focus on that, to share with them our views on what alternative [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  actions could be. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=110.04s)]
*  Blinken's trip comes as health authorities in Gaza plead for more aid. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=111.2s)]
*  They warn Palestinian children there have already starved to death. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=115.68s)]
*  A federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to investigate possible bias among the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  jurors deciding the case of the Boston Marathon bomber. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=125.36s)]
*  The attack in 2013 left three people dead. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=129.08s)]
*  As NPR's Tovia Smith reports, lawyers for Jokar Tsarnaev say he should get a new trial [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=132.2s)]
*  to decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  Defense attorneys have been calling into question two jurors since Tsarnaev's 2015 trial when [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=142.16s)]
*  they discovered social media activity suggesting a bias. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=147.52s)]
*  One juror retweeted a message calling Tsarnaev a piece of garbage. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=151.44s)]
*  The appeals court overturned Tsarnaev's death penalty, saying he didn't get a fair trial, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=155.68s)]
*  but the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=160.0s)]
*  Now the trial court itself must investigate further. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=162.68s)]
*  Former federal judge Nancy Gertner says there's a good chance Tsarnaev will get a new trial [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=166.24s)]
*  to determine his sentence. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  This was at least arguably a misrepresentation about their opinions about Jokar Tsarnaev. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=172.12s)]
*  Tsarnaev is currently on death row in a federal supermax prison. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXSq8yyzej0&t=178.8s)]
