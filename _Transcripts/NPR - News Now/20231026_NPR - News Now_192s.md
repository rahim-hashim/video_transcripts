*  Good morning. I'm Korva Coleman from NPR News and here are today's top stories. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=10.48s)]
*  Multiple people are feared killed and injured in Maine after mass shootings last night. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=14.72s)]
*  Police are still hunting for a suspect named Robert Card. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=19.12s)]
*  NPR's Martin Costey reports there was a shooting rampage through the town of Lewiston last night. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  The first report of an active shooter came from a bowling alley called Spare Time Recreation. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  And Dispatch Radio quickly reported the shooter's description as recorded here by Broadcastify.com. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  It's going to be a male black hair with a hoodie, looks like a rifle. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=38.44s)]
*  But even as police units were still headed there, calls started coming in from a restaurant on the other side of town. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=41.64s)]
*  So we're going to bring our units to Schmengy, Schmengy's right now, another active shooter there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=47.64s)]

*  And soon Dispatch Radio had reports of another possible target, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=56.12s)]
*  something they said they'd learned from a family member of the potential suspect. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=60.04s)]
*  Apparently the family member was told by him that that's where he was going next, his mixer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  But that bar, Mixers, wasn't open last night. Martin Costey, NPR News. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=68.84s)]

*  A competing measure offered by Russia didn't pass either. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  Linda Fasulo reports the UN General Assembly could vote as soon as today on a non-binding resolution. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=90.12s)]
*  The U.S. draft Security Council resolution did not call for a ceasefire, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=96.12s)]
*  but rather for humanitarian pauses to permit access to aid in Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=100.12s)]
*  It also demanded the release of all hostages held by Hamas, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=104.36000000000001s)]

*  Russia's proposed measure, which called for humanitarian ceasefire, received four votes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=125.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, the General Assembly is likely to vote on a draft resolution proposed by Jordan [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=131.0s)]
*  that calls for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=135.88000000000002s)]

*  when General Motors and Chrysler both went through bankruptcy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=174.92s)]
*  All three companies were in trouble and the UAW gave up big concessions to help them survive. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENjhn4joTIc&t=178.83999999999997s)]
