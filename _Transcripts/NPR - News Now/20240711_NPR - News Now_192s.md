*  attempt. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1zLzT1vTQk&t=173.26000000000002s)]
*  The amendment would have legalized abortion up to 18 weeks of pregnancy and made exceptions [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1zLzT1vTQk&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  in the case of rape and incest and the risk of life to the mother. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1zLzT1vTQk&t=178.28s)]
