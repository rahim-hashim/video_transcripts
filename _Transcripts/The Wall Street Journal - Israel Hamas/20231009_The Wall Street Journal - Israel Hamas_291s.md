*  weekend. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=24.52s)]

*  of Hamas and Hezbollah said. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=53.56s)]
*  The green light for the attack, which included air, land and sea incursions, was given at [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=56.32s)]
*  a meeting in Beirut last week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=60.92s)]
*  A spokesman for Iran's mission to the UN said Iran stood in support of Gaza's actions, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  but didn't direct them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=68.4s)]
*  Hamas is considered a proxy group of Iran. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=69.88s)]
*  The exact nature of how much Hamas is being led by Iran has always been unclear. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  But of course, they receive a lot of their funding from Iran, a lot of their training [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  from Iran, and a lot of their weapons from Iran. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=82.84s)]
*  That is according to Israeli officials here in Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=85.72s)]
*  The planning for the operation began in August, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=90.08s)]
*  The direct Iranian involvement could raise the risk of a broader conflict in the Middle [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=95.28s)]
*  East. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=99.44s)]
*  U.S. officials say they haven't seen evidence of Tehran's involvement. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=100.44s)]
*  There's a long relationship between Iran and Hamas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=106.16s)]
*  In fact, Hamas wouldn't be around in the way that it is without the support that it's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=108.6s)]
*  received from Iran over the years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  In this specific instance, we have not yet seen evidence that Iran directed or was behind [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  this particular attack, but there's certainly a long relationship. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=120.66s)]
*  On Sunday, more than 250 people were found dead at a music festival in Israel, according [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=124.84s)]
*  to Israeli state broadcaster, Khan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=129.92s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a general to coordinate search efforts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=133.24s)]
*  for captured and missing Israelis. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=137.66s)]
*  The mother of a missing woman described a phone call from her daughter during the attack. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  At 10 o'clock, she called us and said, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=145.06s)]

*  Everybody here is hurt. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=152.46s)]
*  There were four kids in the middle of the kids. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=154.46s)]
*  There were 23, 25, 30. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  Everybody was shot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=160.38s)]
*  They were bleeding. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=161.66s)]
*  Since the conflict began, world leaders have been speaking out, largely condemning the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=163.86s)]
*  attacks on Israel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=167.82000000000002s)]
*  The United States said it would send additional military assistance to Israel, including equipment [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=169.74s)]
*  and weaponry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=174.38000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. also plans to move a carrier strike group closer to Israel's shores and Air Force [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=175.86s)]
*  jet fighter squadrons towards its skies, a move that signals its support and aims to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=180.62s)]
*  deter Iran from taking advantage of the uncertainty in the region. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=187.34s)]
*  A Hamas spokesperson said the decision to deploy an aircraft carrier near Israel by [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  the U.S. is participation in the aggression against our people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=196.54s)]
*  The U.S. is sending one of its largest aircraft carriers to the region, and it's very clear [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  who that's a message to. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=205.26s)]
*  It's not a message to Hamas. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=206.5s)]
*  It's not a message to Gaza. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  That's very clear. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=210.26s)]
*  It's most likely, of course, they do not say this publicly, this is a message to Hezbollah [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=211.5s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=216.42s)]
*  The biggest fear in Israel really is that Hezbollah, which is a militant group far stronger [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=217.42s)]
*  than Hamas, has the means to really wreak havoc in Israel, that they could enter this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=223.26s)]
*  war any day. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=228.33999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah is trying to deter Israel from invading Gaza, from creating a ground invasion into [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=230.33999999999997s)]
*  Gaza, and on the other hand Israel and now the United States are trying to deter Hezbollah [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  from joining this war. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=241.61999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli military said that as many as 1,000 Hamas militants entered Israel from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=243.14s)]
*  Gaza over the weekend, many of whom were armed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli military is preparing the ground in Gaza for an invasion, for a ground invasion. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=251.14s)]
*  They've cleared the communities around the Gaza border, not only because it's not safe [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=256.26s)]
*  for them there, but in order to have freedom of operational movement in that area. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=260.38s)]
*  They have not declared that they will do it, but they are making very clear preparations [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  that they will do it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=268.58s)]
*  If you listen here to the politicians here in Israel, many of them are talking about [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=270.02s)]
*  removing Hamas entirely from the equation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=273.86s)]
*  There's only one way to do that, and that's a ground assault. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=277.14s)]
*  That will take a very long time to do. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=279.86s)]
*  It will be a very difficult and bloody battle. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_e1ytlC5Vo&t=281.78s)]
