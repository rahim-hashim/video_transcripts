# This Boston Real-Estate Lawyer Helped Dozens Evacuate Gaza | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac)
*  It's become more urgent to help people given that the fighting now is in the South. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=0.0s)]
*  Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7th, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=6.0s)]
*  Sammy Nobulsi says he has helped dozens of American citizens and their family members evacuate Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=10.4s)]
*  It's an unlikely role for the 34-year-old Boston real estate lawyer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=17.0s)]
*  I never expected myself to be doing this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=22.0s)]
*  Long days, very long nights, little sleep. There isn't an alternative. These people need help. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=26.5s)]
*  Amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Nobulsi spoke with The Wall Street Journal about his approach for helping evacuate Americans from danger. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=34.0s)]
*  I see a path here to convince them to put the mom and dad on the list. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=45.5s)]
*  I don't know about the brothers and sisters in their family. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=50.0s)]
*  All day long, Nobulsi fields call after call from Americans desperate to get their family members out of Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=53.3s)]
*  When I'm contacted, the person on the phone is frantic. It's not, hey, I've got relatives, I'm trying to get them out. No, it's an emergency situation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=60.3s)]
*  Hamas militants stormed southern Israel on October 7th, carrying out terrorist attacks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=69.3s)]
*  More than 1,200 people were killed, including over 300 soldiers, according to Israeli authorities. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=74.8s)]
*  Israel responded with a campaign of airstrikes followed by a ground invasion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=81.3s)]
*  The fighting has flattened neighborhoods and displaced more than a million Gazans from their homes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=85.8s)]
*  More than 17,000 people have been killed in Gaza during the war, most of them women and children, according to authorities in the Palestinian enclave. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=91.8s)]
*  The figures don't distinguish between militants and civilians. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=100.8s)]
*  My approach for getting families out, frankly, and it shouldn't have to be this way, but it is, it's case by case. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=104.8s)]
*  The end goal is to get them a coveted spot on the U.S. State Department evacuee list to determine who can cross the Rafah border out of Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=111.8s)]
*  Some people just don't even know how to get on the list. Sometimes it's a matter of advocacy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=121.3s)]
*  It's a sibling who the State Department is not willing to help. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=128.8s)]
*  And so now it's, well, we need to try to get a senator involved. We need to get a representative involved. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=133.8s)]
*  Sometimes it's just trying to get information abroad. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=138.8s)]
*  Before the war broke out, Nibulsi had little experience in immigration law, let alone evacuation strategies. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=142.8s)]
*  But on October 11th, he received a frantic phone call from his wife telling him their family friends were trapped in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=150.3s)]
*  Abud Ukao, his wife, and their one-year-old son, all Americans, were visiting family in the northern part of the enclave when the war began. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=158.3s)]
*  It was immediately on October 7th that we realized we needed to get out of there as soon as possible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=167.3s)]
*  This is the actual main gate, and this is where the people, travelers wishing to travel have to be processed through so you can see the people waiting there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=172.3s)]
*  The Ukao family reached out to nearby embassies and the State Department. But no one could give them any information. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=183.8s)]
*  That's when Nibulsi got involved. He called elected officials, members of the State Department, and even people outside of the U.S. in Lebanon and Egypt. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=189.8s)]
*  Every single day I was in touch with elected officials, started certainly with Massachusetts, but by the end of it, it was countrywide. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=198.8s)]
*  Every day I was giving interviews to newspapers, local and national TV channels, really anybody who would listen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=207.3s)]
*  But what do you understand to be the problem about getting Americans out? What's holding this up? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=216.3s)]
*  The problem is the United States government, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, they're not focusing on this issue at all. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=223.3s)]
*  A spokesperson for the State Department said the first month of the crisis was a complex security environment that required intensive negotiations and coordination. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=229.8s)]
*  On November 1st, Nibulsi finally had good news to share. He messaged the Ukaos that they were on the list. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=238.8s)]
*  Thanks in part to his efforts and connections, they crossed the Rafah border into Egypt on November 2nd, then made it home safely to Massachusetts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=245.8s)]
*  And what over time I learned was the plight of hundreds of other U.S. citizens, both there and here, trying to get family members out of Gaza. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=255.3s)]
*  The State Department says it's in touch with about 300 U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, and their immediate family members who are still trapped in Gaza. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=265.3s)]
*  Of those 300, about 50 are U.S. citizens. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=273.3s)]
*  After that success, Nibulsi was flooded with calls, emails, and messages from other Americans trying to get their loved ones out of Gaza. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=277.8s)]
*  From the, yeah, the Rafah crossing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=285.8s)]
*  People also began reaching out to him for another reason, to help. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=288.8s)]
*  I didn't have these contacts, whether it was in the media, elected officials, a Lebanese general, and others who were trying to help. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=293.8s)]
*  It was just people, people who heard the story of fellow American citizens who were trapped in Gaza, who just wanted to offer any assistance that they could. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=303.3s)]
*  And that's how we just through snowball, a snowballing effort, got in touch with all kinds of people. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=311.3s)]
*  And as the situation in Gaza rapidly changes, it's created more challenges for getting people out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=318.3s)]
*  I think the biggest challenge is that there is no place safe. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=324.3s)]
*  Even when you head south, where we were staying in Rafah, we've had several airstrikes that hit a few hundred feet away from the house that we were staying in. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=328.8s)]
*  We've had the walls literally crack, and that's how intense the bombardments were. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=335.8s)]
*  And that was supposed to be a safe zone. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=341.8s)]
*  On December 3, Israel began sharply expanding its evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip, as it launched a ground invasion in the south. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=343.8s)]
*  My fear now is, we can do all the advocacy we want here in the United States. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=351.8s)]
*  But I don't know that they have a forum over there to then advocate. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=358.3s)]
*  And that's going to make it very difficult to get Americans out, to get their relatives out. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=362.3s)]
*  This, combined with dwindling food, water, and fuel resources, has complicated Nablusi's efforts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=368.3s)]
*  Transportation has been a major issue. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=375.3s)]
*  Trying to coordinate and arrange for alternative travel to the Rafah border crossing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=377.3s)]
*  So now every next day is not promised for the people we're helping. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=383.3s)]
*  This makes every case immediate and urgent. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=387.8s)]
*  Some Americans in Gaza are reluctant to leave other family members behind, like Ukal's family. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=389.8s)]
*  The current situation is that my parents are on the list. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=395.8s)]
*  They are American citizens. They can't leave Gaza. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=398.8s)]
*  My mom says there's no way that she could stomach leaving two sons, two daughters, several grandchildren behind in Gaza. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=401.8s)]
*  None of Ukal's siblings in Gaza are American citizens, except for his youngest brother. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=410.8s)]
*  This severely limits their evacuation eligibility. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=416.3s)]
*  Right now it's parents, children, and unmarried siblings under the age of 21. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=419.3s)]
*  I've been trying to advocate to expand that eligibility to include all siblings. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=425.3s)]
*  There are other issues at the border too. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=430.3s)]
*  There's been several incidents where parents who are American would be on the list, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=432.3s)]
*  and their young child who's also American would not be on the list or the other way around. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=437.3s)]
*  And you'd see people crying at the crossing, pleading, saying, you know, how can I leave my three-year-old son behind? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=441.8s)]
*  While Nablusi is still deeply involved with evacuating citizens out of Gaza, his efforts have also shifted into the realm of policy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=450.8s)]
*  I spent the last couple days down in D.C. trying to get senators and representatives to advocate to the State Department [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=458.8s)]
*  to expand the list of people that they're willing to help get out of Gaza into Egypt. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=466.3s)]
*  The second piece I've been doing is just trying to advocate for some more streamlined immigration or visa type program. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=472.3s)]
*  In the meantime, Nablusi continues to juggle his day job amid the growing demands of his evacuation and advocacy work. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=481.3s)]
*  I'm very fortunate and lucky here to have a supportive office. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=488.3s)]
*  If we don't do something to help these people, they're going to die, frankly, from either starvation, dehydration, or an airstrike, whichever gets them first. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilMSveQeaac&t=493.3s)]
