# WSJ Correspondent Sees Panic on Israel-Lebanon Border During Drone False Alarm | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4)
*  The northern border with Lebanon has been active and quite hot since Saturday when Hamas militants carried out the terrorist attack in southern Israel that killed more than 1200 Israelis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=0.0s)]
*  There's been skirmishes between Hezbollah fighters and the Israeli military every day. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=13.0s)]
*  It's sort of been anti-tank fire and small missiles going back and forth. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=18.0s)]
*  The hope certainly in Israel is that Hezbollah will not launch a major attack. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=23.0s)]
*  Hezbollah has many more missiles than Hamas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=27.0s)]
*  Its missiles are more deadly, more potent, more accurate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=32.0s)]
*  It would put incredible strains on Israel's military, on its air defenses if Hezbollah were to join the fight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=37.0s)]
*  There are Israeli forces spread out all across the border with Lebanon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=44.0s)]
*  There's thousands of soldiers, tanks, artillery positions. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=49.0s)]
*  It was more tense than I expected it to be. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=53.0s)]
*  We got to the Israeli border and there were air raid sirens that started going off, indicating that there was potentially incoming missiles or drones or maybe even ground forces, Hezbollah forces coming in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=58.0s)]
*  We got to a spot where there was an Israeli military patrol and they waved us into a bomb shelter in the middle of the forest essentially. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=72.0s)]
*  And said, you got to get out of your car now, you got to come into the shelter now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=80.0s)]
*  And so we ran into the shelter. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=83.0s)]
*  Hey guys. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=85.0s)]
*  There was about a half dozen Israeli soldiers in there and a handful of Israeli civilians. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=88.0s)]
*  They were incredibly tense and anxious and they were getting reports over the radio. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=93.0s)]
*  All indications are there are Hezbollah drones in the sky. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=107.0s)]
*  It was very, very tense. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=111.0s)]
*  We were fortunate that the reports of this major attack turned out to be false, but it just sort of for us captured the sense of tension and anxiety. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=113.0s)]
*  These forces were hearing and being told that the second front had opened. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=122.0s)]
*  The soldiers here say they are ready. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=126.0s)]
*  They're ready if that happens. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=129.0s)]
*  One of the soldiers told us that if Hezbollah joins the fight, they will do to Hezbollah what they're doing right now to Hamas in Gaza. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=131.0s)]
*  Hezbollah is a much more fearsome military organization than Hamas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=142.0s)]
*  They have hundreds of precision guided missiles that can effectively target Tel Aviv. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=147.0s)]
*  And so it's going to be a much harder fight for Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=152.0s)]
*  So it would be a real strain for the military. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KuKfsUqmk4&t=156.0s)]
