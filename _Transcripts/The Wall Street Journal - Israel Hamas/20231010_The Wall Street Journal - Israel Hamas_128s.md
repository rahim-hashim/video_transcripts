# WSJ Correspondent Shelters From Rocket Attack in Southern Israel | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI)
*  We went into one of the towns on the border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's about a half mile from the Gaza Strip border called Sderot. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  We went into the town and the Israeli military told us that everything was fine. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=9.0s)]
*  And about 10 minutes later, Hamas rocket attack slams into the city. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=14.8s)]
*  We ran for cover. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  You're so close to the Gaza border there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=23.4s)]
*  You really only have a few seconds before the rockets hit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  Israel's famed Iron Dome defense system did not work to hit all the rockets. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=32.6s)]
*  And so we had a rocket hit. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  I've destroyed a car a few blocks away. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  Pretty jarring experience. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=48.2s)]
*  Fortunately, nobody was injured. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  We got a chance to look around the town. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=52.8s)]
*  It was the aftermath was remarkable. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=54.4s)]
*  The Israeli military had an operation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=57.1s)]
*  They'd actually had to destroy the city's police station with a bulldozer to get out Hamas militants from there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=59.5s)]
*  We saw one of the ATVs that one of the Hamas militants had used for the attack. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=65.7s)]
*  It's covered in blood, coated in blood with flies on it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=70.9s)]
*  We saw the destroyed cars. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=76.4s)]
*  Cars that had been a set ablaze with people inside of it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=79.1s)]
*  You could see the remnants of people inside. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=81.7s)]
*  It's quite intense down here, to be honest. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=85.7s)]
*  It's a full on war zone. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=87.5s)]
*  We also talked to soldiers that are on the border here preparing for a potential offensive in Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=89.7s)]
*  There are dozens and dozens of tanks digging in for the fight. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=95.8s)]
*  We talked to soldiers that are ready to go in as soon as they get the order. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  This will probably be the largest ground offensive that they've launched there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  And they have called up tens of thousands of reservists. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=109.1s)]
*  You're starting to see them converging on there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=111.8s)]
*  I think they still need time to prepare the forces and get people in place. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glBu2An_UoI&t=114.1s)]
