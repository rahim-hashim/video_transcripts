Video Description: Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defense system is designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and mortars. It’s blocked thousands of missiles since 2011, including those launched by Hamas during this past weekend’s attack. The Palestinian militant group launched an estimated 3,500 rockets from Gaza.

WSJ explains how Israel’s Iron Dome works and has a 90% success rate.

**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I)
*  Beginning on Saturday, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an estimated 3,500 rockets [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=0.0s)]
*  from Gaza into Israel, according to the Israeli military. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  As Israelis sought shelter, they had an added layer of protection. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=13.9s)]
*  Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, a land-based system that intercepts and destroys [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=19.76s)]
*  short-range rockets and mortars. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=24.94s)]
*  It has become a bedrock of the country's defense since its introduction in 2011. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=28.9s)]
*  Israeli military said the Iron Dome is currently operating at the same capacity as previous [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=33.98s)]
*  rounds, with a 90 percent success rate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=38.82s)]
*  Here's how the complex detection and interception system works. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  The system is powered by missile defense batteries, each consisting of three main components. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=46.42s)]
*  These batteries can defend against short-range rocket and mortar attacks within almost 45 [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=51.56s)]
*  miles of the battery. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=56.22s)]
*  They're also mobile, so they can be moved to where they are needed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=57.620000000000005s)]
*  First, a radar unit detects an incoming rocket and relays information about its speed and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  trajectory to the battery's control center. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=65.5s)]
*  The control center's computers calculate if the rocket is going to hit populated areas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=67.86s)]
*  If it is, a missile is fired from the launcher. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=72.84s)]
*  Each launcher contains 20 interceptor missiles. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=76.0s)]
*  Each receives constant guidance updates from the control center and its internal radar. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=78.9s)]
*  The missile destroys the incoming rocket by exploding near it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=83.18s)]
*  The goal is to do this far away from populated areas, minimizing damage on the ground. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=86.34s)]
*  As of 2021, the defense system had intercepted over 2,400 rockets bound for civilian areas [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=91.9s)]
*  since its launch in 2011, according to an Israeli military spokesperson. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=98.62s)]
*  During a conflict in 2012, the Iron Dome knocked down 421 rockets launched from Gaza and bound [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=103.34s)]
*  for Israeli cities before a November ceasefire. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  And during the 2014 war in Gaza, it intercepted 700 rockets fired by Hamas, effectively blunting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=113.66s)]
*  the group's aerial effect. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=120.58s)]
*  The United States has provided over a billion dollars in funding for the system and has [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=122.3s)]
*  also bought and is testing two Iron Dome batteries of its own. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=126.96s)]
*  In 2021, concerned about the possibility of attacks from China, U.S. forces began testing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=131.18s)]
*  a version of the Dome in Guam. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=136.66s)]
*  Israel has expanded the defense system by installing missile batteries on ships. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=138.62s)]
*  Earlier this year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told The Wall Street Journal that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  he wouldn't support sending the system to Ukraine to defend against Russian attacks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=147.66s)]
*  We're concerned also with the possibility that systems that we would give to Ukraine [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  would fall into Iranian hands and could be reversed engineered. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=159.42s)]
*  And we would find ourselves facing Israeli systems used against Israel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTKb7Ffcv2I&t=167.26s)]
