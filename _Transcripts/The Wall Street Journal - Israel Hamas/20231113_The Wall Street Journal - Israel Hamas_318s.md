**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg)
*  This cycle of death, of blood, of revenge is going on for over a century. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=0.0s)]
*  We are acting the same way and expecting different results. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=7.92s)]
*  It's horrible to see when there are people getting killed, especially innocent people [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=11.58s)]
*  getting killed. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=17.8s)]
*  I think there is in both of the sides majority that want to live in peace. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=18.8s)]
*  We can't destroy Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=24.36s)]
*  We can't. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=26.52s)]
*  Saturday morning I woke up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=27.52s)]
*  730 checking my WhatsApp that there are sirens and alarm. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=40.04s)]
*  The bomb sirens started to go off in Jerusalem. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=44.96s)]
*  I understand what is going on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=48.08s)]
*  I call my mom, mom are you okay? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=50.08s)]
*  My dad told me yes there are many shooting and missile landing around but we are okay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=54.24s)]
*  We are in the safe room. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=60.08s)]
*  And when I turned on my phone around 820, two text messages popped up immediately. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=61.6s)]
*  The first said I love you and immediately the next one said I'm sorry. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=68.2s)]
*  We were at the music festival when the massacre started to take place. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=83.56s)]
*  All the young people tried to take cover in these roadside bomb shelters. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  It came under heavy attack with hand grenades thrown in and an RPG was shot into it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  The eyewitnesses told us that his left arm around the elbow down had been blown off and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=105.88s)]
*  he walked out of the bomb shelter and was loaded on a Hamas pickup truck. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=114.6s)]
*  His last phone cell signal was found inside of Gaza at 1025 in the morning and that's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=122.16s)]
*  all we knew. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=128.4s)]
*  In 10am we lost contact with her. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=135.64s)]
*  My sister called me. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=145.16s)]
*  She tried to call mom again and the Hamas answered her phone. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  A few days after we saw in the Hamas Facebook page that they took her into a car. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=151.88s)]
*  And that's all we know until today. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=160.92s)]
*  I watched the news and I saw Toyota trucks in the road. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=165.64s)]
*  I saw the wall falling apart. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=181.6s)]
*  We tried to call again and again and there was no answer. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=186.11999999999998s)]
*  Around 5pm the security guy of the community called my brother-in-law and he told him that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=191.32s)]
*  my parents house is burned to ashes with two bodies inside. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm drowning in this ocean of sorrow and pain and agony but my mind is very clear. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=207.24s)]
*  My goal number one is to bring all those I kidnapped and being held hostage back home. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=226.68s)]
*  And it must be through a diplomatic agreement. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=231.96s)]
*  Goal number two is to stop the war and immediately cease fire. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=236.24s)]
*  We have these constant cycles of extreme violence and it seems that it's really not working. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=242.68s)]
*  I don't know that it's ever worked anywhere. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=251.88s)]
*  I have a lot of anger on the Hamas people, our government, but I don't think to escalate [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=255.0s)]
*  the war will help us not to bring them back and not to give them a peaceful life after. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=261.64s)]
*  Innocent civilians in Gaza are being killed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Their deaths won't bring my parents back. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=274.68s)]
*  Their deaths won't bring those that are kidnapped back to their families. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=278.52s)]
*  For some people a natural response to trauma is to feel hatred. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=284.68s)]
*  This pain that we are feeling is so unique and indescribable but I really would never wish it on anyone. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=291.52s)]
*  Not anyone. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=300.52s)]
*  Not even the people who are doing it to me. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=302.52s)]
*  That's how bad the pain is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoOOT4Vwimg&t=305.52s)]
