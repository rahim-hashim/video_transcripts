# Videos Show Hamas Trained for Oct. 7 Attack in Plain Sight for Years | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4)
*  The Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th seemed to come out of nowhere. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=0.0s)]
*  But in reality, Palestinian militants can be seen preparing for it in plain sight in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=9.76s)]
*  training videos like these for years. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  These videos, which were widely posted to social media, look nearly identical to the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=18.0s)]
*  attacks on the 7th that killed more than 1,200 Israelis. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=22.88s)]
*  Last December of 2020, a loose coalition of Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=28.92s)]
*  called the Joint Room, posted videos to Telegram of their annual training exercises. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=34.24s)]
*  The journal reviewed hundreds of posts and had military experts analyze them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=40.6s)]
*  They show participants blowing up border fences, raiding military bases, taking hostages, and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  traveling in convoys of white pickup trucks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=52.2s)]
*  These annual training sessions took place every December at outdoor locations throughout [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=56.42s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=61.02s)]
*  One location is less than two miles away from the era's border crossing, one of the Israeli [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  bases militants attacked on October 7th. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=67.02s)]
*  Arab, Israeli, and Western media even covered the training events. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=70.62s)]
*  By 2023, Joint Room militants appear to be more sophisticated in their tactics, and their [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=77.3s)]
*  annual event was moved up to mid-September, a change from previous years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=82.9s)]
*  Still, Israeli officials seem to have ignored or missed these warnings that mirror the tactics [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=87.98s)]
*  Hamas would use just a few weeks later. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=93.26s)]
*  Perhaps the most sophisticated aspect of the October 7th attacks was Hamas' ability to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  breach the Israeli border fence. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=110.78s)]
*  It's a tactic they had been honing for years and flaunting on social media. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=116.26s)]
*  In 2020 training footage posted to Telegram, we see members of the Joint Room coalition [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=120.94s)]
*  using remote devices to blow up buildings. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  In the following years, they practiced this same skill, now with gates and concrete barriers [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=130.14s)]
*  like those seen on October 7th. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=135.42s)]
*  Once militants broke through the border on October 7th, they invaded a number of bases [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=146.54s)]
*  belonging to Israeli Defense Forces, or the IDF. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=151.1s)]
*  Joint Room training footage shows Hamas and other Palestinian militants went to great [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=155.61999999999998s)]
*  lengths to perfect this tactic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=159.94s)]
*  They created mock IDF bases that featured watchtowers, domes, and gates, exactly like [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=163.14s)]
*  those seen in the structures militants attacked in early October. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=173.54s)]
*  In footage from the 7th, we can see a militant throw an explosive into an IDF base along [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=178.38s)]
*  the border. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=183.06s)]
*  We see them practice a similar maneuver in dozens of training videos since 2020. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=190.98s)]
*  On October 7th, militants divided into teams, taking cover like this as they seized bases. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=204.2s)]
*  It's another tactic they drilled over several years. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=210.62s)]
*  Members who watch this footage say that from 2020 to 2023, training participants gradually [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=216.62s)]
*  look more coordinated, evolving into SWAT-like teams that move and shoot like military infantry, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=222.02s)]
*  much like we saw on October 7th. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=230.3s)]
*  As the attack unfolded on the 7th, militants took more than 200 Israeli civilians and IDF [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=245.82s)]
*  soldiers hostage. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=251.78s)]
*  Here, at the 2020 Joint Room event, participants simulate seizing an Israeli soldier from a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  tank. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=261.86s)]
*  The same tactic is repeated in 2021 exercises. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=263.34s)]
*  And by 2022, it evolves into a group hostage-taking scenario. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=267.94s)]
*  A recurring image through the events of October 7th is the highly organized convoys of white [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=282.9s)]
*  pickup trucks that Hamas and other militants used to carry out the attacks. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=287.7s)]
*  In a training video shared on Telegram in September 2023, just weeks before the attack, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=293.16s)]
*  the same white pickup trucks full of Hamas militants can be seen pulling into the 2023 [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  training site. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=304.0s)]
*  And this September 10th Telegram post describes Joint Room leadership touring observation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=305.14000000000004s)]
*  points along the border wall. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=309.62s)]
*  The same pickup trucks are seen shuttling the entourage in photos of the inspection. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=312.12s)]
*  One asked whether Israel took any measures to guard against the tactics seen in these [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=318.44000000000005s)]
*  videos and posts. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=322.24s)]
*  The IDF said it is focused on eliminating the threat from Hamas and will look into such [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=324.1s)]
*  questions at a later stage. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=328.52s)]
*  Despite these examples and the warnings they may have offered, Israeli officials failed [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  to ward off what led to the deadliest attacks in the country's history. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=337.16s)]
*  . [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZYaOFfTqM4&t=352.24s)]
