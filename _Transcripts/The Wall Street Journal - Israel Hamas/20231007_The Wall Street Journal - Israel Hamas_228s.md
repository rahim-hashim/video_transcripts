# Israel Declares War On Hamas Following Unprecedented Wide-Scale Attack | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [October 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared war on Hamas after the Gaza-based [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=0.0s)]
*  militant group launched an unprecedented surprise attack on Saturday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=9.52s)]
*  In what was the biggest attack on Israel in years, the Palestinian militants launched [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=13.84s)]
*  a barrage of more than 5,000 rockets in a coordinated attack by land, sea and air. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=34.28s)]
*  The Hamas military commander called the assault Operation Al-Aqsa flood and urged Palestinians [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=41.8s)]
*  everywhere to fight against Israeli occupation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=47.64s)]
*  Rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip as far north as Tel Aviv. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=52.0s)]
*  Gunmen also entered the country from the south and a stunning infiltration of Israel's defences. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=58.0s)]
*  Hamas said it had taken over several Israeli villages in the country's south. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=64.12s)]
*  Gunfire could be heard echoing across the town of Sderot, which lies less than a mile [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=71.0s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=75.96s)]
*  Residents have been warned to stay inside while emergency responders activated amidst [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=78.52s)]
*  the fighting. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Palestinian families across Gaza have begun fleeing their homes in fear of Israeli retaliation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=83.96s)]
*  Israel's defence force is the Middle East's most formidable. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=113.88s)]
*  Made up of 169,000 active duty troops and 465,000 reservists, it is supplied with some [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  of the world's most advanced drones and weaponry. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  The US provides Israel with $3.8 billion in annual military assistance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  Saturday's attack holds deep significance for Israel as the country has just marked 50 [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=137.12s)]
*  years after the Yom Kippur War. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=142.48s)]
*  In that conflict in 1973, Egypt, Syria and other Arab countries launched a war on Israel [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=144.04s)]
*  on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=151.24s)]
*  I think right now Israelis are in a severe state of shock. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=153.84s)]
*  They almost don't have words because they're just so surprised by this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=157.8s)]
*  And I think that right now people are being called up to reserves all across the country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=161.72s)]
*  Obviously, there's been a lot of political turmoil in Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=166.56s)]
*  There have been a number of military reservists who said that they would refuse to report [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=170.88s)]
*  for duty because of this battle over the judiciary in Israel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=175.12s)]
*  Everybody's put that aside now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=180.36s)]
*  There's a mass protest movement that has called off all the protests and all the reservists [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=182.2s)]
*  who originally had said that they wanted people to refuse to report for duty are now urging [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  everybody to report for duty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=192.52s)]
*  So I think the country right now is just going into fight mode, survival mode, like real [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=194.28s)]
*  survival mode. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=198.56s)]
*  I think that people probably don't want to start pointing fingers, but very quickly that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=200.32s)]
*  will start happening. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=205.76s)]
*  And obviously the first finger will be pointed at the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=207.4s)]
*  and we'll see where he goes from here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=213.68s)]
*  In response, Israel's military launched airstrikes on what is said were Hamas targets in Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRLSKbVfHMw&t=217.24s)]
