# Hamas Attack: Hundreds Killed and Israeli Hostages Taken Into Gaza | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU)
*  Explosions rumbled through the night after Israel declared war on Hamas on Saturday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas, a militant group from Gaza, coordinated an unprecedented attack early Saturday on Israel [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=9.6s)]
*  by land, air and sea, shocking the country and the world. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And a senior official in Hamas said Saturday's attacks are only the beginning of the conflict. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=30.0s)]
*  The country right now is just going into fight mode, survival mode. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Though Israel and Hamas have been entangled in a decades-long conflict in Gaza, here's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=52.24s)]
*  why this attack is different and what it could mean for Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=58.12s)]
*  This has never happened. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=68.0s)]
*  Israel has fought many wars against its Arab neighbors, but it has never experienced anything [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  like this where Palestinians have actually come into Israel proper and committed such [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=74.12s)]
*  widespread attacks. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=79.66s)]
*  Hamas says it is dedicated to building an independent Palestinian state. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  The group controls the Gaza Strip, a densely populated Palestinian enclave that, for years, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=86.84s)]
*  has been under Israeli blockade. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  The last major conflict between Hamas and Israel was in 2021, in which more than 250 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=95.92s)]
*  people in Gaza and 14 in Israel were killed. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=102.76s)]
*  The attacks only stopped after 11 days, when Egypt brokered a ceasefire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=106.4s)]
*  What is most interesting is that in recent months, I would say that Israel has actually [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=112.0s)]
*  described Hamas as being somewhat more reasonable and more of a partner than some other elements [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=116.4s)]
*  within Palestinian society. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=122.56s)]
*  And so it seems that whatever Hamas was, whatever message they were sending to the Israelis, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=124.52s)]
*  it was very clearly deception. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=130.0s)]
*  Saturday's attack holds deep significance for Israel, as the country has just marked [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=133.2s)]
*  50 years after the Yom Kippur War. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=137.8s)]
*  It was October 6, which is an attack that was launched against Israel by Syria, Egypt [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=141.16s)]
*  and several other Arab countries, and in which Israel was completely unprepared, had a very [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=146.68s)]
*  similar experience. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=151.48s)]
*  They were caught off guard. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=153.0s)]
*  Though caught by surprise, Israeli soldiers fought Saturday evening to regain control [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=155.2s)]
*  and expel militants from local towns and villages. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=160.24s)]
*  Hamas has started a resurgent and dangerous war. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=163.8s)]
*  We will win this war, but the price is heavier than its price. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=168.8s)]
*  Rockets fired from Gaza lit up the sky Saturday night. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=174.68s)]
*  Israeli forces used their Iron Dome air defense to intercept and destroy the rockets. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=178.56s)]
*  The death toll from the initial attack remains unclear, as Israel scrambles to assess the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=184.4s)]
*  situation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=189.44s)]
*  The UN said at least 20,000 people in Gaza have been displaced from their homes as of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=195.88000000000002s)]
*  Considering the fact that something like this is completely unprecedented, I would expect [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=196.88s)]
*  them to use all their resources, ground, air, and it's going to be devastating for the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=200.72s)]
*  people of Gaza. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=207.24s)]
*  I don't see any other way that this could possibly go. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=208.24s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of lost lives all across the board. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8704W8oUU&t=212.16s)]
