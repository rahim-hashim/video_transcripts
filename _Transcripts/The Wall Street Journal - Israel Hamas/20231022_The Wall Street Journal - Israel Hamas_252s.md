# Video Analysis Shows Gaza Hospital Hit By Rocket Meant for Israel | WSJ
**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8)
*  On October 17th, an explosion occurred in the courtyard of Al-Akhli Arab Hospital in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza City, killing civilians. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=10.0s)]
*  Palestinian officials blamed Israel, but a visual analysis by the Wall Street Journal [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=13.6s)]
*  shows that the explosion was caused by a failed rocket launch from inside Gaza, where Hamas [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have been shooting rockets into Israel since the war began two [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=28.08s)]
*  At around 6.59pm local time, four cameras captured the moments before and after the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=29.08s)]
*  incident. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=35.28s)]
*  The journal geolocated and verified the timing of the footage, and mapped each camera's vantage [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=36.82s)]
*  point. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=41.68s)]
*  Camera 1, a live feed webcam located just south of Tel Aviv, looks south at Gaza. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=43.76s)]
*  Camera 2, a surveillance camera in Israel near the northern border of Gaza, also facing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=50.0s)]
*  south. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Camera 3, a live streamed Al Jazeera news broadcast in western Gaza faces east. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=57.44s)]
*  And camera 4, a bystander cell phone video just southeast of the hospital, where the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=63.72s)]
*  explosion occurred. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=68.32s)]
*  With this combined view, we can see the failed rocket launch and resulting explosion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=70.48s)]
*  At about 6.59pm, camera 2 near the Gaza border shows what rocket experts say is a barrage [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  of short-range rockets, likely capable of traveling between 12 and 25 miles, being launched [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=83.0s)]
*  from western Gaza northeast toward Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=89.48s)]
*  Then, about 20 seconds later, we see what experts say is a long-range rocket launched [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=92.76s)]
*  from Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=98.28s)]
*  The rocket was launched in a northeastern trajectory toward Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=99.8s)]
*  Ten seconds after launch, a tiny flash of light is seen, and the rocket starts to veer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=104.48s)]
*  back west. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  The flash and change in trajectory are consistent with a failed rocket, not with Israel's iron [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=110.86s)]
*  dome defense system shooting it down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=116.16s)]
*  Weapons experts the journal spoke to say this change in trajectory is caused by the explosion [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=119.7s)]
*  of the rocket motor. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=124.2s)]
*  In camera 3, the Al Jazeera footage, facing east, we can see this minor explosion. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=126.88s)]
*  Then, a trail of fire spreads as the motor blast ruptures the rocket casing and ignites [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=132.42s)]
*  the fuel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=138.02s)]
*  The rocket heads west, in the direction of camera 3, with the hospital in its path. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=140.64s)]
*  Fifteen seconds after launch, the rocket fails completely and breaks apart. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  There's a small explosion on the ground, then a second, larger explosion at the site of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  the hospital. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=156.55999999999997s)]
*  A nearby resident captures the moment of impact facing northwest toward the hospital. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Fire engulfs the courtyard and burns for an extended period. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=169.12s)]
*  Experts say the large fire is likely due to the amount of fuel still in the rocket just [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  after launch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  Explosives experts, who reviewed the blast footage and photos of the aftermath, see further [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  evidence that the failed rocket was the cause of the explosion on the ground. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=189.4s)]
*  This crater shows an impact pattern coming from the east, in line with the rocket's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=195.54s)]
*  path. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=200.62s)]
*  The shallowness of the crater is also consistent with impact from a failed rocket. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=201.62s)]
*  Experts say the cars closest to the impact crater were likely hit with fragments from [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  the rocket, causing one to explode and burning several others. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  These marks next to the crater and damage to the buildings show that the fragments from [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=216.72s)]
*  the impact flew across the grassy areas where civilians were sheltering. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=220.98s)]
*  Failed rockets are not uncommon in the long-standing conflict between Hamas and Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=226.54s)]
*  The United Nations determined that in the 2022 flare-up between the two sides, 20% of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  rockets fired from Gaza failed and in three cases likely resulted in large numbers of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  civilian casualties. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8&t=242.38s)]
