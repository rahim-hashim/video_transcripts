**The Wall Street Journal - Israel Hamas:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s)
*  I was born and raised in Kfar Aza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful place. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=12.64s)]
*  There's grass, it's open, and good people. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=13.64s)]
*  Uri and I got married in 2007. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=18.72s)]
*  We have three daughters, Maya, Alona, and Liela, 13, 11, and 9. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=23.48s)]
*  Uri is a mechanical engineer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=29.44s)]
*  We're good people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=33.0s)]
*  We wanted peace. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=34.0s)]
*  We did everything for that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=35.0s)]
*  We were always waiting for something to happen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=48.0s)]
*  It's like something you feel in the air. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  We had a routine already because we knew how to cope with this escalation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=53.2s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=57.44s)]
*  What we met on this terrible, horrific Saturday was a horror movie. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=58.44s)]
*  It was something new. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=66.56s)]
*  At around half past six in the morning, we started hearing shooting. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=68.96s)]
*  We say, okay, it's an escalation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=75.32s)]
*  Something's going on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=77.68s)]
*  Fine, we'll go to the fortified rooms. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=78.68s)]
*  And Uri and our dog would sit there for just, I don't know, maybe it was one second. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=81.32s)]
*  And I sit with the girls and, okay, we know what to do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=88.0s)]
*  We started hearing shooting. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=92.8s)]
*  We heard Arabic. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=95.68s)]
*  So I realized something different is happening. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=98.4s)]
*  And I know Uri realized the same. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=101.2s)]
*  He started getting messages saying, this is not a drill, it's real. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=104.28s)]
*  He went to our bedroom, changed his shirt, took his personal weapon and left. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=113.6s)]
*  I'm not sure he put any shoes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=118.0s)]
*  We hear the door close. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=122.16s)]
*  And the girls ask me, did dad go? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  And I say, no, dad's not going without saying goodbye. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=128.88s)]
*  And I write him a message straight away, why did you go without saying goodbye? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=132.32s)]
*  But he left. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=136.2s)]
*  He rode on his bike straight to the weaponry to take another weapon. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=138.12s)]
*  And I stayed with the girls, with the girls in the fortified room. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=144.28s)]
*  Till that point, I thought maybe the army was around me taking care of us, maybe, I [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=148.4s)]
*  don't know. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=154.4s)]
*  But I realized they weren't. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=155.4s)]
*  So I think I realized something was very wrong because it wasn't answering my messages at [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=157.8s)]
*  all. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  All we hear is shooting, red code alerts, bombs going off. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=166.2s)]
*  Like this is the soundtrack when we're in this room. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=171.95999999999998s)]
*  I didn't realize, I still didn't understand that they were killing all of us. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=176.44s)]
*  Everybody, they were contacting me to tell me what's going on, where is Uri, what do [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=189.16s)]
*  you need? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=195.0s)]
*  And the only thing I need is to find Uri, please find Uri. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=196.0s)]
*  I think around midnight, the army came. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=211.84s)]
*  They evacuated us, we walked, ran, walked with the army. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=215.44s)]
*  It was night, so I can't say I saw a lot of bodies, but I saw some on the way to the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  gas stations and I made sure the girls don't look. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  I think a part of me knew. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  I realized. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  I realized he would call me, he would contact me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=241.76s)]
*  We buried him next to where his parents live. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=252.48s)]
*  For me, I know Uri was a hero because I know I married a hero. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=283.48s)]
*  What we had on this Saturday is unacceptable. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=292.48s)]
*  Too many people died waiting to be rescued. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=306.48s)]
*  We're all going to have to live with that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIReYFMUs1s&t=310.48s)]
