# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Mark Dubowitz (Jun. 20)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM)
*  Good morning. It's Friday, June 20th. The multi front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=0.0s)]
*  623 days old. I'm your host, Jonathan Schanzer. Welcome back to the FTD Morning Brief. And [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  man, is it good to be back if I don't say so myself. I was leading an FTD delegation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=29.68s)]
*  of journalists in Israel when the war broke out. We were pinned down in our Jerusalem [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=35.36s)]
*  hotel as Iranian ballistic missiles rained down on Israel. Sleep was elusive. As were [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  options for flight out of the country, that airspace is still shut. So after a few days, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=45.8s)]
*  I made the decision to take the group over land to Jordan. From there, we made our way [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=51.68s)]
*  and by Wednesday evening, everyone in our group was home. More on that harrowing trip [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=56.76s)]
*  over the coming days, but suffice it to say, my thoughts remain with friends and colleagues [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=61.92s)]
*  in Israel who have no intention of leaving and who are toughing it out with the fiercest [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=67.0s)]
*  battle that this country has endured in decades. Today's guest is Mark Dubowitz, FTD CEO and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=71.94s)]
*  host of the Iran Breakdown. Mark has been Iran obsessed for years and this is the moment [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=78.6s)]
*  that he knew was coming. He'll be joining us in a few minutes to help us unpack the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=83.2s)]
*  history we're watching unfold in real time. We'll hear how he's thinking about the war, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  what it might portend for the future of Iran and for the region. We'll get him in about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  as much time as it took me to get from the seventh floor of my hotel to the bomb shelter. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=96.62s)]
*  Will he or won't he? That's the question everyone is asking right now. Donald Trump has some [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=102.48s)]
*  serious decisions to make about America's possible entry into Israel's war against the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=107.0s)]
*  Islamic Republic of Iran. Here's the good news. Israel has done all of the heavy lifting [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=112.28s)]
*  until now. There are no Iranian air defenses. A big chunk of the nuclear program is gone. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=117.4s)]
*  Top regime officials have been liquidated. Other major assets of the regime have been [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=123.2s)]
*  steadily picked apart by Israeli warplanes that have absolute air superiority in the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=127.16s)]
*  skies over Iran. So what's the problem? Simple. It's the isolationist wing of the MAGA movement. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=133.04s)]
*  They warn that the Middle East is quicksand. They want to keep our powder dry for China. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  And they warn that once America enters the Middle East, we are destined to become mired [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=143.92s)]
*  in the dysfunction of this troubled region. If you ask me, these people have over-learned [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  the lessons of our botched nation-building experiments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nobody [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  is asking America to nation-build. Nobody is asking America to put boots on the ground [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=158.56s)]
*  either. I'm not telling you there's going to be zero risk if Trump were to commit to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=163.6s)]
*  taking out the Fordo nuclear facility or the bunker where Ali Khamenei is hiding. But [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=167.6s)]
*  Iran is not Iraq. Iran is not Afghanistan. Iran is, well, Iran. If we don't enter the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  fray, that's fine. American interests don't always align with Israeli interests. But in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  this case, they do. So we should at least thank the Israelis because they've already [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=183.44s)]
*  made the world a safer place. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=188.0s)]
*  Now for your headlines. Headline one, hackers stole approximately $90 million from Iran's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  largest cryptocurrency exchange. The hackers call themselves Predatory Sparrow. They may [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=197.36s)]
*  be linked to Israel. The group drained $90 million worth of crypto from Nobitex, which [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  is Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange. Predatory Sparrow said that Tehran uses Nobitex [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  to evade Western sanctions. And they seem to be onto something. A blockchain analytics [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  firm called Elliptic said that members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  have used Nobitex and that there's evidence of funds flowing from the exchange to Hamas [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=223.72s)]
*  and the Houthis, two Iranian proxies. Here's the crazy thing. The hackers reportedly transferred [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=228.28s)]
*  the stolen crypto into digital wallets that they don't control. Imagine stealing $90 million [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  and then promptly lighting it on fire. Hey, Predatory Sparrow, maybe next time transfer [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=241.0s)]
*  a little to a think tank that I know in Washington. We promise to give you a letter acknowledging [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=246.0s)]
*  your white hat tax exemption. Headline two, Iran and Israel are slugging it out like two [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=250.92s)]
*  boxers in the 10th round of a heavyweight bout. Early Wednesday or yesterday morning, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=256.52s)]
*  Thursday morning, the Israeli Air Force struck Iran's Arak heavy water reactor. Arak was [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=261.68s)]
*  hit during a wave of overnight strikes that saw some 40 Israeli fighter jets drop more [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=266.28s)]
*  than 100 munitions on dozens of targets. The Arak reactor wasn't operational, at least [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=271.3s)]
*  not yet. Under the terms of the 2015 deeply flawed Iran nuclear deal, Iran had agreed [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=276.72s)]
*  to redesign the facility to be less proliferation prone. And in case you're wondering, heavy [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=282.20000000000005s)]
*  water reactors produce plutonium, which can be used to make nukes. But the Islamic Republic [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  wasn't only on defense. The regime launched a ballistic missile straight at Soroka Medical [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=293.44000000000005s)]
*  Center, which is the main hospital in southern Israel. Tehran claimed it was aiming for a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=298.6s)]
*  military and intelligence headquarters nearby. There were dozens of injuries at the hospital, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=303.54s)]
*  but all things considered, the attack could have been much more deadly. The missile hit [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=308.3s)]
*  the old surgical ward at Soroka, which was evacuated the previous day. Headline three, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=312.66s)]
*  as Trump considers what to do next, polls are shedding light about what Americans think [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=319.78000000000003s)]
*  about Iran. Let's break it down. On Wednesday, Fox News released survey data indicating that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=324.14000000000004s)]
*  73% of registered voters think Iran poses a real national security threat to the United [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=330.34s)]
*  States. That's 69% of Democrats, 82% of Republicans, 62% of independents. This makes sense considering [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=336.78s)]
*  that the regime was behind deaths of hundreds of American service members in Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=344.7s)]
*  and it has hits out rather on several current and former US officials. But wait, there's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  more. By CNN's count, 83% of Republicans and 79% of Democrats oppose Iran getting nuclear [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=358.08s)]
*  weapons. That tracks with the whole Iran is a national security threat thing. But wow, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=365.2s)]
*  a majority of folks on both sides of the aisle actually agree on something. You got to hand [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  it to the Islamic Republic for giving Iran or giving Americans rather something to unite [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=375.44s)]
*  around in today's hyper partisan political climate. Democrats and Republicans cannot [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=380.74s)]
*  agree on the color of humus these days, but they can agree on the fact that the regime [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=386.16s)]
*  is toxic. I hope you're paying attention, Mr. President. Bipartisanship is a good thing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=391.16s)]
*  All right. It is time to talk to FTD's Mark Dubowitz. Without further ado, let's bring [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=398.4s)]
*  them on. Welcome to the program, Mark Dubowitz. John Schanzer, good to have you back in Washington, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=403.76s)]
*  Good to be here. All right. Let's start with a war update. The Israeli assault on the Islamic [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  Republic is now more than a week old. Israeli planes are in the air over Iran, striking [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  strategic targets day and night. It is complete and total dominance, air superiority. What [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  have they hit and what is still left to destroy? Strategically, what is going on? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, the most important thing is, again, the nuclear weapons program. They've [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=437.12s)]
*  destroyed a tons one enrichment facility. They've taken out two very important facilities [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=441.24s)]
*  in Isfahan, a conversion facility that takes yellow cake into uranium hexafluoride to produce [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  enriched uranium and centrifuges. But the more important one, John, which has gotten [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=451.22s)]
*  very little attention, which is they took out a conversion facility that takes the 90% [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=454.76000000000005s)]
*  enriched uranium, converts it into uranium metal. John, uranium metal, you need that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  for a nuclear warhead or even a crude nuclear device. That facility is gone. They've taken [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  out 14 out of 15 nuclear weapons scientists that were on Mossad's original target list. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=469.6s)]
*  This is kind of Robin Oppenheimer and his band of nuclear weapons scientists gone in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=475.04s)]
*  January 1945 at Los Alamos, maybe four months before the Trinity nuclear weapons test. That's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=480.56s)]
*  a big blow to the regime. They've taken out many other elements. But John, what's remaining [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=487.38s)]
*  is the Fordow enrichment facility buried underground under a mountain with centrifuges. They've [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=492.56s)]
*  got enriched uranium 60% worth about 17 bombs worth. That is still to be taken out. And [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=498.12s)]
*  that is the element that the United States needs to help. Yeah, that is the big one, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=503.96s)]
*  right? That's the thing that all eyes are on Fordow and maybe that bunker where the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=509.56s)]
*  supreme leader is hiding. And that's the other question, I guess, is whether the Israelis [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=513.72s)]
*  take that fateful decision to remove Ali Khamenei. As we're speaking right now, I've got the [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=517.84s)]
*  TV on right over my screen. Israelis are being told to get ready to go into bomb shelter. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=524.02s)]
*  A rare kind of mid afternoon attack apparently about to take place. The Iranians are about [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=529.9s)]
*  to hit the Israelis. There's also looks like dozens of rockets and missiles sites that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=536.26s)]
*  they're noting right now on the screen that are about to be targeted. So the Iranian regime [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  is still firing at Israel, right? And so while I think we understand the Israeli strategy, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=549.56s)]
*  which is to defang that nuclear program and to pick apart the key assets of the Islamic [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=555.56s)]
*  Republic, to pick apart the regime, more or less to weaken it steadily. I think that we [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=561.3599999999999s)]
*  understand that from the Israeli side. But here's my question. What is Iran's strategy [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=568.3599999999999s)]
*  right now? They're firing ballistic missiles at Israel every night. And that's pretty much [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  all they have right now. Maybe those proxies could activate again that so-called ring of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=578.0600000000001s)]
*  fire. But what do we think the regime is trying to achieve right now as it launches these, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=582.5400000000001s)]
*  you know, every couple of hours, it's more assaults on Israel? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=590.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's trying to make sure that it has more missiles and enough missile launchers [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=593.62s)]
*  to grind down the Israelis in a war of attrition. So the Israelis are running out of arrow interceptors, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=599.38s)]
*  unable to take down those missiles. Those missiles continue to land, hit civilian sites, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=605.38s)]
*  hospitals, schools, neighborhoods, and they have two pound or two ton warheads that can [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=610.58s)]
*  still do devastating damage that they haven't yet used. So the Israeli Air Force is hunting [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=615.82s)]
*  missile launchers. They've gotten about 40% of them. Taking out the inventory, we think [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=619.82s)]
*  about 50% of them. So it's grind down Israel. The other play for the Iranians is in Oman, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=625.2s)]
*  right? It's the diplomatic play. It's to trap the Trump administration in endless negotiations [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=630.62s)]
*  and see if they can actually emerge with their nuclear program at Fordow still intact, extract [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=635.86s)]
*  billions of dollars in sanctions relief, and prevent the Israeli Air Force and Mossad from [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=641.98s)]
*  continuing to operate. So there's a diplomatic play in Oman. There's a grinding play with [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=646.9s)]
*  that war of attrition. By the way, they have other assets, sleeper cells in Europe and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=651.86s)]
*  the United States to go after Jewish targets, Israeli targets. They could go after U.S. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=655.62s)]
*  military bases. I think that'd be suicidal. They could close the Strait of Hormuz, equally [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=660.3s)]
*  suicidal, but they have still multiple plays. It's a wounded animal. There's nothing more [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=663.86s)]
*  dangerous than a wounded animal. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=668.06s)]
*  Yeah. And I've got to note that some of these new weapons, there's reports of cluster munitions [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=669.5s)]
*  now being fired by the regime, obviously deadly. And actually one of our viewers was actually [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=676.9s)]
*  asking this question. I see the question pop up here on my screen. That is something that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=683.66s)]
*  we're watching every time new munitions are introduced to this theater. It's an escalation [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=688.14s)]
*  and the Israelis are going to have to think about how they're going to respond in kind. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=693.6999999999999s)]
*  But I do think that we're watching two different timelines. The Iranians trying to grind down [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=697.54s)]
*  Israeli air defenses while the Israelis are trying to grind down those ballistic missiles [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=702.22s)]
*  and other weapons and those launchers, which are important, even if they have a thousand [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=706.78s)]
*  ballistic missiles, five thousand ballistic missiles, whatever the number is, if they [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=711.1s)]
*  can't get them off. So Israel is doing its work from the skies. The Iranians are trying to [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=715.54s)]
*  push back. And this is a battle of wills, really. I mean, war is the imposition of wills. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=721.26s)]
*  And we're going to see who comes out on top between this battle of wills. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=726.62s)]
*  But let me just say this. And I'm genuinely I just I don't I need guidance here. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=731.14s)]
*  Some people say that the regime should surrender. And I think we're hearing that from the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=737.0600000000001s)]
*  president of the United States, the Europeans. I actually just saw a headline from [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=740.7s)]
*  Macron in France, who's basically saying that Iran needs to end its nuclear program, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=745.46s)]
*  end its proxies, end its ballistic missiles. That's full surrender here. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  So let me ask you point blank. Can the Islamic Republic of Iran still be the Islamic [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=755.5400000000001s)]
*  Republic if it surrenders to Israel and America? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=760.86s)]
*  Their rejection of America and Israel are core pillars of this regime. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=764.4200000000001s)]
*  So can they even survive if they surrender? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=769.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, ask and answer it right. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=773.26s)]
*  It's effectively the Islamic Republic of Iran will not be the Islamic Republic of Iran [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=774.86s)]
*  if it it meets President Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=778.98s)]
*  It will not be in the shape and form that it is now. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=782.82s)]
*  Does that mean it's going to go down? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=786.9s)]
*  We can talk about that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=788.26s)]
*  I mean, it's severely weakened. Key nodes have been of oppression have been actually [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=789.34s)]
*  targeted by Israel. It's really important that the Minister of Defense of Israel, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=795.38s)]
*  Minister Katz, actually made very clear just recently that they're going after the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=800.1s)]
*  internal repression apparatus, which is what the regime uses when Iranians take to the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=804.62s)]
*  streets to beat them up, murder them, torture them and and really crack these these [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=809.9s)]
*  protests that we've seen since 2009. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=817.5s)]
*  Without that, Iranians can come to the streets and take back their country. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=819.98s)]
*  As long as that remains, the regime, it's wounded. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=823.94s)]
*  It's going to actually be even more brutal and more repressive against Iranians. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=826.5s)]
*  It's one of the reasons Iranians are not on the streets right now. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=829.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's day seven or eight bombs are still dropping, but they're just looking to [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=832.4200000000001s)]
*  see are there is that apparatus still going to be intact? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=835.82s)]
*  And if they take to the streets, are they going to be even more brutally repressed than [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=840.02s)]
*  they've been in the past? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=844.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so let's talk about this. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=845.58s)]
*  People of Iran are crucial to bringing down the regime. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=847.26s)]
*  They've been pretty quiet so far. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=850.26s)]
*  I mean, this really is the dog that hasn't barked. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=851.66s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=854.14s)]
*  What should we do? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=855.66s)]
*  Should we do anything right now to try to get them out into the streets? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=856.8199999999999s)]
*  This would if I'm looking at this right while the regime is reeling and they are reeling [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=859.8199999999999s)]
*  right now, they don't control their own airspace. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=864.5s)]
*  They've had multiple key nodes of the regime destroyed. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=867.1s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis are picking it apart. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=870.78s)]
*  If there was ever a moment for the people to come out, it's probably now. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=872.8199999999999s)]
*  So this is the dog that didn't bark. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=877.14s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=879.02s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, I think the United States needs to focus like a laser on the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=879.9s)]
*  nuclear weapons program. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=883.74s)]
*  That is the most important thing. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  President Trump's got a decision to make. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=886.06s)]
*  Does he go to Amman or does he go to Fordow? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=887.6999999999999s)]
*  And I think the important decision is really what is a U.S. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=890.26s)]
*  priority. Get rid of the nuclear weapons. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=893.9s)]
*  The last thing we want is the Islamic Republic emerging from this with the ability to use [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=895.62s)]
*  Fordow to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=899.66s)]
*  What should the Israelis be doing? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=901.42s)]
*  The Israelis should be doing exactly what they're doing, going after this apparatus of [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=902.54s)]
*  repression. But the Israelis have also been working on plans to provide support to the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=905.78s)]
*  Iranian people. We can get into the details if you're interested. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=910.78s)]
*  But there are plans and operations that are underway to help our Iranians, not literally, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=913.54s)]
*  but figuratively, with the kinds of things that they need in order to stand up against [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=918.94s)]
*  this brutal repression apparatus and also to target the support base of the regime, the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=923.46s)]
*  20 percent and the one percent elite that support this regime. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=927.58s)]
*  There are existing fractures and fissures that preexist of this war. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=931.26s)]
*  Those are only going to intensify as a result of the beating that the Islamic Republic has [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=934.7s)]
*  taken. There should be efforts underway to widen those fractures and fissures and try [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=938.7s)]
*  to flip members of the regime's security apparatus against the regime. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=943.38s)]
*  It may not become opposition figures, but if they stay off the streets, if the police and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=948.14s)]
*  members of the Revolutionary Guards and others decide, you know what, we're not going to [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=953.18s)]
*  the streets to beat up our fellow Iranians, you can start to wear away at that important [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=956.54s)]
*  foundational base of support of the regime. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=961.34s)]
*  Now you're starting to see a much weakened regime. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=963.78s)]
*  This is the way to undermine this regime. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=966.42s)]
*  And maybe if history smiles on us, there will be a significant leadership transition. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=968.3s)]
*  Well, let's hope for that. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=974.06s)]
*  And I think that is what we're still all hoping for and watching for. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=975.3s)]
*  That would actually take care of a lot of the concerns that we're hearing from the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=979.26s)]
*  administration, I think, as they're trying to figure out if they attack, whether there [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=983.74s)]
*  are, you know, sleeper cells or other concerns that they're going to need to contend [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=987.54s)]
*  with. Meantime, as as we speak here, I see that the regime in Iran has launched another [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=992.98s)]
*  round of missiles at Israel. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=999.78s)]
*  Northern Israel is under attack right now and southern. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1002.4200000000001s)]
*  Interestingly, the center of the country seems to be, I don't want to say safe, but [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1006.14s)]
*  it's been spared on this particular round. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1010.86s)]
*  Unclear what the regime is targeting, but obviously lots of military assets and civilians [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1013.46s)]
*  in both northern Israel and southern Israel. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1018.82s)]
*  I got a question that came in here about Hezbollah. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1022.4200000000001s)]
*  And I didn't I didn't plan to ask you this, but I do think that maybe it's worth part of [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1028.5s)]
*  our discussion here. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1033.3s)]
*  How concerned should we be? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1035.66s)]
*  Do you think about the reactivation of the ring of fire? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1037.7s)]
*  In other words, Israel has for now, it seems to have deterred. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1042.26s)]
*  I mean, the Houthis have been quiet, relatively speaking, only a handful of missiles have [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1046.1000000000001s)]
*  come out since this war began. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1051.26s)]
*  Absolute quiet in Lebanon. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1053.06s)]
*  You know, Hamas doesn't seem to be able to squeeze off missiles throughout this crisis [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1056.1s)]
*  for like a week. I think we've only seen one or two. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1060.02s)]
*  You know, Iraq has just been crickets, which I mean, they've got massive assets over [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1063.3s)]
*  there. So this is another dog that has in part you. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1068.26s)]
*  You and I have been talking about this ring of fire for quite some time. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1071.5s)]
*  What do you think's going on here? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1074.66s)]
*  I'll give you my take, but I'm curious of yours. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1075.9s)]
*  Now, listen, I'm very concerned. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1078.8200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think, as I said, Hamenei is a wounded animal. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1080.3400000000001s)]
*  He's saving these capabilities in reserve. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1083.0600000000002s)]
*  I think he's saving some of these capabilities if the United States intervenes. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1085.5s)]
*  And there, as you know, John, I mean, his boss look at thousands of fighters. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1089.42s)]
*  It's still got somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 60 percent of its rockets and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1092.74s)]
*  missiles, depending on what we're talking about and ranges. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1097.38s)]
*  It's been quiet, but Hamenei has saved them in reserve as of the Houthis and the Iraqi [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1101.0200000000002s)]
*  Shiite militias and all of this ring of fire that you've talked about. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1106.14s)]
*  The capabilities have been degraded. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1109.3400000000001s)]
*  They have not been destroyed. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1111.0600000000002s)]
*  And the big question for all these proxies is, are we going to finally listen to [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1112.5800000000002s)]
*  Hamenei at the moment where the Islamic Republic is taking this beating? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1117.7800000000002s)]
*  And are we going to be activated and are we going to listen and fire on the Israelis? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1121.8200000000002s)]
*  This is what Hamenei built them to do. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1126.66s)]
*  This is what they are ideologically committed to do. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1128.6200000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, if they see a losing Islamic Republic and they know that the United [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1131.0600000000002s)]
*  States and Israel will respond and respond in ways that could take from degradation [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1135.22s)]
*  to elimination, that may actually give them cause. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1140.02s)]
*  But we should absolutely be concerned. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1142.74s)]
*  We should deterred. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1144.58s)]
*  And the Israelis have been rushing forces to the north and making sure that they are [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1145.66s)]
*  prepared for any kind of response. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1149.3s)]
*  John, I'll just finish with this compared to what the Israelis had anticipated. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1150.9s)]
*  They had anticipated as a result of this operation, not dozens of deaths, but many [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1155.02s)]
*  hundreds of deaths without his ballot with his ball there. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1160.3s)]
*  They would have expected maybe thousands of deaths. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1163.6599999999999s)]
*  So compared to what the Israelis have been planning against so far, thank God, the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1166.3s)]
*  casualty numbers have been much lower. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1170.9399999999998s)]
*  And the response of Hamenei's proxies has been significantly mitigated. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1173.02s)]
*  But again, one must always assume the worst case and figure out ways to mitigate against [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1178.4599999999998s)]
*  it, not to get too optimistic and Pollyanna about Israeli successes as as incredible as [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1182.3799999999999s)]
*  they've been. Yeah, my sense, Mark, is that I think they're keeping their powder dry [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1187.7399999999998s)]
*  to see whether Israel's air defenses become crippled and that if in fact they see an [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1193.06s)]
*  opportunity, then maybe they try to take it. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1199.74s)]
*  But until now, they know that they can't. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1201.8999999999999s)]
*  But it's also interesting because even if Israel starts to run out of arrows and that's [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1205.02s)]
*  obviously one of the most closely guarded secrets in the Middle East, how many arrows [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1208.7s)]
*  Israel has, there's also don't forget that that is also defending against the ballistic [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1212.18s)]
*  missiles. But the Israelis have a lot more in the in the in the way of the short range [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1216.66s)]
*  defense. Right. That's Iron Dome. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1221.82s)]
*  They've got a lot more as far as David Sling is concerned, that mid that mid level air [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1223.74s)]
*  defense. So those are the systems that would take out attacks from the ring of fire. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1228.06s)]
*  And so I think I think the Israelis look like they're in pretty good shape. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1233.98s)]
*  I'm right now I'm more concerned about the ballistic missiles because we just don't know [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1238.62s)]
*  how many more of these that Israel can sustain. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1243.58s)]
*  It's a lot. We're actually just seeing right now that there are a couple of areas across [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1245.74s)]
*  Israel where rockets have been missiles have in fact made impact. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1250.9s)]
*  That's happening right now as I'm watching Channel 12 in Israel, one in the Tel Aviv [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1255.18s)]
*  region, as they call it, Gushdan, the center of Israel, but others as well. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1260.02s)]
*  All right. Last question for you. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1265.66s)]
*  I know we're running a little late here, folks, but I think it's a good conversation and [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1267.7800000000002s)]
*  we're getting in some good questions from from our audience. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1271.14s)]
*  And we're obviously giving you some updates from the ground in Israel. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1274.94s)]
*  But my last question, Mark, is and this is when you knew I was going to ask, what are [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1278.66s)]
*  Donald Trump's options as he weighs a strike on Iran? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1282.46s)]
*  I mean, what is he thinking about in your view? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1285.86s)]
*  I know he's thinking about what the damage might be to the United States if we get in. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1288.46s)]
*  He's trying to handle the MAGA right wing sort of isolationist as opposed to the left [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1292.7s)]
*  wing isolationist. And they seem to be working in concert. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1298.06s)]
*  But what is what's going on here in terms of the deliberations at 1600 Pennsylvania? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1301.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't want to make too much of the isolationist influence. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1307.66s)]
*  I think Donald Trump at this point is not listening to those voices. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1310.3s)]
*  I think he's sitting down with Mike Corrillas, an comm commander, John Ratcliffe, the CIA [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1313.58s)]
*  director, his key military advisors, security advisors. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1318.02s)]
*  And he's saying to them, all right, at what point have we had the Israelis minimize the [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1321.42s)]
*  risk to U.S. forces and to our pilots? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1326.3s)]
*  And when these narrowed that risk delta, that's a moment where he says, OK, I have [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1330.06s)]
*  this opportunity now to go to Fordow. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1336.86s)]
*  The other hand, he's talking to Steve Witkoff and his diplomats and he's saying, all [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1339.1s)]
*  right, what are the Europeans saying and what are the Iranians saying? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1342.86s)]
*  Are they actually prepared to come back to Oman and negotiate their nuclear surrender? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1345.9399999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of Libya disarmament where we all go in and we take out their [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1351.6599999999999s)]
*  nuclear infrastructure. As President Trump has said, John, worth remembering two months [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1356.2199999999998s)]
*  ago, Iranians can either blow up their own facilities under U.S. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1359.74s)]
*  supervision or someone's going to blow it up for them. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1363.3799999999999s)]
*  I think President Trump is still there and he's still deciding between that. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1365.74s)]
*  I want to say one other thing. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1369.54s)]
*  One doesn't want to overstate that. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1370.98s)]
*  I do think the president was part of one of the greatest deception operations probably [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1372.46s)]
*  since Operation Overlord when we fooled the Nazis into thinking we're going to Calais [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1376.38s)]
*  instead of going to Normandy. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1380.34s)]
*  I think the operation last week, that deception operation, which I think was long in the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1381.86s)]
*  planning, it caught the IRGC and the security establishment figuratively, but actually [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1386.14s)]
*  literally in their beds on Thursday night when Israeli planes struck them precisely in [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1391.22s)]
*  their apartments in the right bedroom, on the right side of the bedroom and took out [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1396.22s)]
*  nuclear weapons scientists and senior commanders. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1400.26s)]
*  So I think the deception operation is still at play and Trump may be deceiving everybody [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1403.26s)]
*  again that this is not two weeks of negotiations, but the bombs could start dropping on [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1408.46s)]
*  Sunday. Again, don't want to predict, don't want to make too much of that. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1412.8600000000001s)]
*  But if you look at last week and the preceding couple of weeks, that was exactly what [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1417.18s)]
*  happened. The Iranians thought they were going to show up on Sunday for another great [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1421.7s)]
*  offer from the Americans. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1425.58s)]
*  And they thought the Israelis were not going to bomb at all because Trump had issued a [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1427.06s)]
*  red light. And instead, three days before the negotiations were to return, Trump had [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1431.78s)]
*  given a green light and the Israelis struck. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1437.46s)]
*  On day 61, the first day after that 60 day deadline that the president had given the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1440.42s)]
*  Iranians. So I agree that deception was incredible. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1446.58s)]
*  I think it will go down in history as one of the most remarkable moments in the Middle [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1451.1799999999998s)]
*  East and in terms of that strong special relationship that exists between the United [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1456.4199999999998s)]
*  States and Israel. We're going to keep watching here. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1462.22s)]
*  I want to thank you, Mark, for joining us today on the FTD Morning Brief. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1465.06s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for having me, John. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1468.9399999999998s)]
*  All right, folks, I'm still watching the news here. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1470.42s)]
*  You've got right now, Israel's version of the Red Cross has taken a sweep of the [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1473.3000000000002s)]
*  country after we've had a couple of direct hits reported from that latest round of [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1478.1000000000001s)]
*  Iranian missiles. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1483.54s)]
*  In the meantime, here's what FTD has on tap for you today. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1485.0600000000002s)]
*  My colleague Hussein Abdel Hussein published a piece in the Algeminer about the Gulf [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1488.0600000000002s)]
*  Cooperation Council's response to Israel's operations in Iran. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1492.18s)]
*  Turns out all six GCC countries denounced Israel and kicked into de-escalation mode. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1496.42s)]
*  Qatar and Oman might hold hands with the Islamic Republic under the table, but [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1502.66s)]
*  regional giants like Saudi Arabia and UAE see the regime as a threat. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1506.66s)]
*  Profiles encourage these countries are not. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1511.66s)]
*  Hussein explains that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are taking a wait and see approach because [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1514.34s)]
*  they don't want to risk backlash from Tehran and they can be sure, or they want to be [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1518.5s)]
*  sure rather, that America will have their backs. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1522.62s)]
*  FTD's Tzvi Khan is out with a new insight on our website that runs through a list of [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1525.62s)]
*  Iranian and Iran-backed attacks on Americans since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1529.8999999999999s)]
*  It's quite a rebuke of the isolationists who claim that America has no interest in [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1534.8999999999999s)]
*  the fate of the Islamic Republic. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1539.5s)]
*  Finally, if you want a break from all the Iran stuff, check out the policy brief that [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1541.5s)]
*  FTD's new analyst Angela Howard penned about the latest round of failures in Iran. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1545.94s)]
*  And about the latest round of failed Russia-Ukraine peace talks, the European Union [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1550.94s)]
*  proposed yet another bunch of sanctions to prod Moscow back to the negotiation table, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1555.54s)]
*  but Angela cautions that nothing's likely to change without American skin in the game. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1561.54s)]
*  Washington should roll out new legislation that expands existing sanctions and targets [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1566.54s)]
*  third-party enablers of Russia's war machine. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1571.54s)]
*  Watching right now on the news, I can see at least one site where there is a fire that [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1574.54s)]
*  the Israelis are looking to put out. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1580.54s)]
*  So far, nothing else beyond that popping up on my screen. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHV-eDX93HM&t=1582.54s)]
