# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Roi Kais (Jul. 9)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M)
*  Good morning. It's Wednesday, July 9th. The multi front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm your host, Jonathan Schanzer. Welcome back yet again to the FTD Morning Brief. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=24.4s)]
*  Well, it's all smiles at the White House. Between Bibi and Trump, the duo are looking to transform the Middle East now that the Iranian regime is hobbled, but there's one fly in the ointment right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=31.4s)]
*  I'm talking about Gaza. A Qatari negotiating team met with Donald Trump's chief Middle East envoy, Stephen Witkoff, yesterday for three hours at the White House. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=42.4s)]
*  One of the top state sponsors of Hamas, a government that gave Hamas $30 million a month leading up to the 10-7 attacks, met with a senior U.S. official in the White House, no less, to discuss the terms of a possible ceasefire. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=52.4s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. Qatar keeps trying to breathe life back into their terrorist client using their influence with Witkoff and others in Washington. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=67.4s)]
*  How much longer are we going to let this farce play out? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=77.4s)]
*  Today's guest is Roey Case, the Arab affairs correspondent for Israel's Channel 11, or as it's known in Hebrew, Kana HaTisrei. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=82.4s)]
*  He has the inside scoop on dynamics within the Arab world, including the potential for Israel-Syria normalization, the current state of affairs with Hezbollah, the situation in Gaza, and much more. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=89.4s)]
*  Stay tuned for that conversation, which is going to come your way in just a few minutes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=101.4s)]
*  Naim Qasem, the new Secretary General of Hezbollah, assumed his job last year by a process of elimination. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=106.4s)]
*  Literally, the original head of the Lebanese terrorist group was killed by Israel, as was his successor. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=113.4s)]
*  As was his successor's successor. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=120.4s)]
*  Well, yesterday, Qasem took to the airwaves to try and buck up whoever is still left among the Hezbollah faithful. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=122.4s)]
*  His speech fell flat, if you ask me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=128.4s)]
*  First, Qasem acknowledged that his terrorist group had been compromised by Israeli intelligence. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=131.4s)]
*  Really? As they say in Arabic, duh habibi. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=136.4s)]
*  Hezbollah's penetration by Israeli intelligence was made abundantly clear by the exploding pagers and walkie talkies that killed dozens and wounded hundreds of Hezbollah commanders in September of last year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=139.4s)]
*  My favorite part of the speech, though, was when Qasem insisted that none of his organization's loyal leadership was flipped by Israeli intelligence. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=152.4s)]
*  As if there were more than a handful of Hezbollah's pre-10-7 leaders left living. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=161.4s)]
*  None of his bull fertilizer should come as a big surprise coming from Naim Qasem. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=166.4s)]
*  He was literally Hezbollah's chief propagandist before his three predecessors met their 72 virgins. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=170.4s)]
*  That's 216 virgins in total for those counting at home. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=176.4s)]
*  So what's next for Naim Qasem? That all depends. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=180.4s)]
*  Tom Barrack, the new administration ambassador to Syria, seemed to indicate the other day that there was a place for Hezbollah in Lebanon as long as the group disarms. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=183.4s)]
*  Me? I say the entire operation needs to go because any remaining shred of the Iran Bactera group could allow for a comeback in Lebanon. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=193.4s)]
*  Now for your headlines. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=202.4s)]
*  Headline one, the Houthis have resumed attacking ships in the Red Sea. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=204.4s)]
*  Yesterday, Iran Bactera out of Yemen attacked a Greek-owned Liberian flagged cargo ship called the Eternity Sea. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=209.4s)]
*  That's C as in Charlie. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=217.4s)]
*  The Houthis targeted the ship with bomb-laden drones as it was traveling toward the Suez Canal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=219.4s)]
*  Men in small boats also approached the Eternity Sea and opened fire. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=224.4s)]
*  Three sailors died and two were wounded. One lost his leg. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=228.4s)]
*  The ship apparently sank last night. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=232.4s)]
*  The Eternity Sea was the second ship attacked this week. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=234.4s)]
*  On Sunday, the Houthis attacked a different Greek-owned Liberian flagged ship called the Magic Seas. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=237.4s)]
*  That's C as in Red Sea. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=242.4s)]
*  The attack involved drones, missiles, and rocket-propelled grenades. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=245.4s)]
*  Oh, and some small arms fire too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=248.4s)]
*  The 22 crew members abandoned the Magic Seas and the Houthis, ever boastful, said they sunk it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=251.4s)]
*  These are the first Houthi attacks on commercial ships since November. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=256.4s)]
*  And in case it's not clear to all, these attacks violate the ceasefire that the Houthis agreed to with Donald Trump back in May. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=261.4s)]
*  If you ask me, the Iranian regime needs to be held accountable for all of this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=268.4s)]
*  They are the patrons. The Houthis are just the clients. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=273.4s)]
*  Headline two, the Trump administration revoked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's designation as a foreign terrorist organization, as an FTO. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=277.4s)]
*  You know them as HTS. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=286.4s)]
*  They're the Sunni jihadist group that ousted the Bashar al-Assad regime back in December. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=288.4s)]
*  Its members now rule Syria. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=292.4s)]
*  HTS spun out of the Nusra Front, which spun out of al-Qaeda. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=294.4s)]
*  So no, the HTS designation was not a case of wrongful conviction. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=298.4s)]
*  But the Trump administration believes that the new Syrian government, led by Ahmed al-Sharah, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=302.4s)]
*  has sufficiently proven that HTS has shed its jihadi stripes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=310.4s)]
*  That's a little dicey. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=315.4s)]
*  President Trump met with al-Sharah in May. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=317.4s)]
*  Apparently he was quite impressed with the ex-al-Qaeda leader. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=320.4s)]
*  Yesterday Trump told reporters that al-Sharah comes from a quote, very tough background, end quote. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=323.4s)]
*  So he knows al-Sharah's history. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=328.4s)]
*  But things are moving in the right direction, apparently, as it relates to Syrian normalization with Israel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=330.4s)]
*  In fact, Syrian, or rather Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even backed the Trump administration's move [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=336.4s)]
*  to lift the sanctions on HTS in pursuit of a normalization agreement. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=342.4s)]
*  And Netanyahu sent his national security adviser, Tzachi el-Negbi, to meet with al-Jolani in UAE. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=347.4s)]
*  Here's hoping that both Bibi and Trump know what they're doing here. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=354.4s)]
*  This is a high wire act. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=358.4s)]
*  I'm curious to see how it all ends up. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=360.4s)]
*  Headline three, a tragedy in Gaza on Monday evening. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=362.4s)]
*  Five Israeli soldiers were killed and 14 more were wounded. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=366.4s)]
*  Two of the wounded soldiers are in serious condition. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=369.4s)]
*  According to an IDF probe, Hamas operatives remotely detonated three roadside bombs in succession. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=375.4s)]
*  The first explosion caused multiple casualties. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=381.4s)]
*  The second bomb hit the troops who rushed to their aid. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=384.4s)]
*  Hamas terrorists then opened fire as the third explosion rang out. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=387.4s)]
*  So no, Hamas is not defeated. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=390.4s)]
*  But this incident doesn't mean that the group is ascendant either. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=393.4s)]
*  If you ask me, the group's recent successes are signs of its desperation. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=396.4s)]
*  By the way, four of the soldiers who were killed serve in the Netanyahu Battalion, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=400.4s)]
*  which is the battalion of ultra-orthodox soldiers of the Biden administration, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=405.4s)]
*  considered sanctioning for alleged human rights abuses in the West Bank. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=409.4s)]
*  And bonus headline four, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=413.4s)]
*  for two senior Taliban officials. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=418.4s)]
*  The warrants are against the Taliban's emir as well as the group's chief justice. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=420.4s)]
*  The ICC said the pair are, quote, criminally responsible, end quote, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=425.4s)]
*  for the persecution of girls and women in Afghanistan since August 15th, 2021. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=429.4s)]
*  Yes, that's the date of the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=435.4s)]
*  It's all terrible stuff. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=440.4s)]
*  The Taliban specifically targets women and girls, depriving them of education, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=441.4s)]
*  privacy, and the freedom of movement, expression, and thought. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=446.4s)]
*  Don't forget, this is the same Taliban that Team Biden called partners [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=449.4s)]
*  before we bounced out of there nearly four years ago. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=454.4s)]
*  All right, it's time to dive into that conversation with Roy Case of Israel's Channel 11. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=458.4s)]
*  Let's welcome him onto the show. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=464.4s)]
*  Welcome to the program, Roy Case. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=469.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, Jonathan. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=471.4s)]
*  Thank you for hosting me. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=473.4s)]
*  Oh, my pleasure. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=475.4s)]
*  If you can, let's turn off those blinkers just so we can hear you better. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=476.4s)]
*  But let me ask you... [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=479.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=480.4s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about Bibi's White House meetings with Donald Trump. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=481.4s)]
*  What are these two up to in the region? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=486.4s)]
*  It looks like they're trying for nothing short of total transformation of the Middle East. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=488.4s)]
*  Is that how you see it as well? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=493.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's another important visit that, in one hand, they're trying to reach to agreement in Gaza, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=495.4s)]
*  that this is the main issue, and we see that the ongoing talks in Doha. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=505.4s)]
*  But I think that if we open the larger picture, we will see that both of the leaders trying to reach a great and very high-scale agreement. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=512.4s)]
*  I mean, agreement for all the region. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=528.4s)]
*  And I think they're trying to see how to do it. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=532.4s)]
*  I think that to everyone is clear, and especially for the Trump administration, that the end of the war in Gaza and agreement in Gaza is the key for another agreement, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=536.4s)]
*  peace agreement, and if you want, another country that will join to the Ibrahim Accords. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=550.4s)]
*  And I think that that's why the administration now is concentrating on reaching to agreement. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=557.4s)]
*  It's not a coincidence that the White House, the man of Trump, Steve Whitcoff, is now wanting to go to Doha to push the two sides, Israel and Hamas, to reach an agreement. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=564.4s)]
*  I think that to everyone is clear that to reach something bigger, we have to reach to agreement in Gaza. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=582.4s)]
*  And I think that this is both issues, and also, also, Jonathan, we have to remember the Iranian issue. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=591.4s)]
*  I think that even if they know the one confrontation ends between Israel and Iran, it's not the end of the day. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=600.4s)]
*  In one end, America trying to reach another agreement with the Iranians. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=609.4s)]
*  We saw yesterday a very unusual meeting in Jeddah between the Quran prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Salman, and the foreign minister of Iran, Arakchi. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=615.4s)]
*  I think that many actors in the region trying to push to agreement between US and Iran, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=628.4s)]
*  but we can rule out that we will see another confrontation between Israel and Iran, and also maybe US, because there is ceasefire, but there is no agreements or nothing. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=635.4s)]
*  And if Iran will try to rebuild its nuclear abilities and military abilities, maybe we will see another operation of Israel. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=648.4s)]
*  I don't think it's maybe the one round, but it's not the last round. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=659.4s)]
*  I agree. I absolutely agree. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=667.4s)]
*  And by the way, that conversation between the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the foreign minister of Iran, that was fascinating to me, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=669.4s)]
*  because it certainly looks like right now the Saudis are maybe trying to talk Iran into capitulating to the United States. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=677.4s)]
*  That's not, of course, where the regime wants to go, and that's going to be very, very interesting. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=683.4s)]
*  But I think just the fact that they met was fascinating in and of itself. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=688.4s)]
*  But I want to ask you, if you can, to talk to us about the state of Hamas. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=692.4s)]
*  I mean, the way I look at it is this organization is pretty beat up by the Israelis right now. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=696.4s)]
*  They're fighting back fiercely, and we've seen some of the successes that they've had against Israel. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=701.4s)]
*  And some are saying that this is Israel's Vietnam, that Israel is getting drawn into the sands or the mud of Gaza. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=707.4s)]
*  But I see it a little differently. I think the organization is really on its last legs. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=713.4s)]
*  It's fighting hard, but it is not the same terrorist group that we saw on October 7th. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=719.4s)]
*  So my question to you, and I know you do a lot of tracking of Hamas. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=725.4s)]
*  My big question is, can Hamas survive in the Gaza Strip if Israel keeps going? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=729.4s)]
*  I think Hamas will survive in a way or another, but I agree with you that it's not Hamas of 7th October. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=738.4s)]
*  It's Hamas more weaker, without its main leaders. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=747.4s)]
*  And I think that Hamas today is trying to survive, survive in the day after the death of Hamas. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=754.4s)]
*  It's not coincidence that John Lennon asked, you know, very worried. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=764.4s)]
*  We see that when Israel took it, took it, the humanitarian aid from the regular mechanism, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=769.4s)]
*  and now there is another foundation, American foundation that's doing this. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=784.4s)]
*  So it's hard. It's raining in Gaza. It's controlling Gaza. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=790.4s)]
*  I think that Hamas, what he is trying to do now is trying to see how he will be surviving Gaza in the day after. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=799.4s)]
*  This is the main mission of Hamas. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=809.4s)]
*  He knows that it can be part of the administration in the day after. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=812.4s)]
*  But, and this is a big but, he's still trying to remain in Gaza with his weapon, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=820.4s)]
*  even if he will not be part of the civil administration. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=827.4s)]
*  So I think that now Hamas is in a bad situation. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=832.4s)]
*  And we see also the groups of Abu Shabaab and another group that are trying to, you know, to try to revoke. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=837.4s)]
*  I don't think it's enough. Hamas, we have to understand its ideology, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=846.4s)]
*  or the, you know, the Mukawamah, the resistance ideology. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=852.4s)]
*  But I think that it is more weaker. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=857.4s)]
*  And I think what he's trying to do is to see how he's part of the picture, even weaker. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=860.4s)]
*  And he hopes that maybe, you know, in the far future... [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=870.4s)]
*  But that's, I think... [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=879.4s)]
*  And also, Jonathan, if we look at the conditions of Hamas in the negotiations. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=882.4s)]
*  So I mentioned the humanitarian aid, but also the issue of the, you know, the place of the forces, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=888.4s)]
*  of the, you know, how, to which point the IDF will retreat in Gaza. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=897.4s)]
*  He is very worried about, for example, the issue of the Mora Corridor, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=904.4s)]
*  Mora Corridor that, you know, separated between Hanunis and Rafah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=911.4s)]
*  And also the remaining forces in Philadelphia. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=916.4s)]
*  So he's trying to see how, you know, to improve its position. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=919.4s)]
*  But, you know, I think, you know, if you are, you know, leader in Hamas today, Jonathan, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=925.4s)]
*  I think you understand very good that the situation is not good. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=931.4s)]
*  And you have to, as I said, to cut the losses in this period of time. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=936.4s)]
*  Absolutely. And I will say that, yes, the ideology of Hamas continues to live. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=943.4s)]
*  But I do think that at the end of the day, the organization continues to live primarily [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=949.4s)]
*  because the Qataris are the ones that are advocating for Hamas. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=954.4s)]
*  They're working right now with the administration to try to improve Hamas's position. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=958.4s)]
*  For some reason, the Trump administration keeps listening to the Qataris. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=963.4s)]
*  I find it very frustrating. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=967.4s)]
*  I think it's the only reason why the Hamas still has even a foothold politically in this conversation. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=969.4s)]
*  But I guess we'll wait and see what happens between Bibi and Trump and Witkoff and the whole crew. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=976.4s)]
*  I want to ask you next about Hisbullah. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=982.4s)]
*  I mean, I saw a speech from Naim Qasem the other day. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=985.4s)]
*  Do you think that this is an organization that's going to transform into a political party, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=989.4s)]
*  as Ambassador Tom Barrack suggests? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=994.4s)]
*  Or do you think that it's going to still hold on to its weapons in the same way that I think you're talking about right now with Hamas? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=996.4s)]
*  They want to hold on to their weapons. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1002.4s)]
*  They're trying, right? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1004.4s)]
*  Both organizations have been beaten by the Israelis, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1006.4s)]
*  and yet they're still trying to just hold on to whatever weapons they can to possibly be able to regroup at a later date. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1009.4s)]
*  So I think it's related to the previous sentence because, as you said, Hisbullah's weapon, Jonathan, is not really Hisbullah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1018.4s)]
*  This is the issue. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1032.4s)]
*  And I think that we can talk about that Hisbullah is a political party, okay, but we have to be realistic. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1034.4s)]
*  I don't think you can disarm Hisbullah fully, okay? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1044.4s)]
*  It won't be, as I said, completely. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1049.4s)]
*  You can't... [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1054.4s)]
*  Hisbullah, by the way, as we talk about Hamas, Hisbullah today is a weaker organization. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1056.4s)]
*  If we come to that previously, before the 7th of October, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1064.4s)]
*  I think, you know, without Nasrallah, after the Israeli maneuver in south Lebanon, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1070.4s)]
*  it's weaker, but it's still there. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1080.4s)]
*  Because why is it still there? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1084.4s)]
*  Because the Lebanese country, Jonathan, is still weaker. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1086.4s)]
*  The Lebanese army is still weaker. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1092.4s)]
*  So the question is, and I think this is the main challenge of Israel, US, and the Gulf countries, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1096.4s)]
*  how you strange the Lebanese country and continue to cause Hisbullah to be weaker. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1105.4s)]
*  I think that that's what Israel is trying to do in the recent months. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1115.4s)]
*  But for your question, I think that Hisbullah is still there. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1120.4s)]
*  Even, you know, we are laughing and Naim Qassem, and, you know, is very, how I said, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1124.4s)]
*  is not the right man, the right place for Hisbullah, okay? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1132.4s)]
*  But eventually Hisbullah is still there, and I think that it will maneuver many, many times [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1137.4s)]
*  until we see Hisbullah only as a political party. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1145.4s)]
*  I can see that there are important changes in Lebanon, in the dynamic, in the rhetoric of the government, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1150.4s)]
*  of the president, also in Lebanon itself, you know, that people don't want it, don't want any wars again. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1160.4s)]
*  And I think, Jonathan, by the way, the fact that Hisbullah only watched when Israel attacked the nuclear sites of Iran, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1168.4s)]
*  I think this is, you know, we can't imagine this thing before 7th October, I think. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1181.4s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely get the sense that Hisbullah understands that the region is shifting. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1188.4s)]
*  The Lebanese government understands it as well. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1193.4s)]
*  But where we go from here is going to be really interesting. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1196.4s)]
*  I saw Israel has been attacking, actually, IDF operating inside Lebanon. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1199.4s)]
*  They took out Hamas operatives in Lebanon. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1203.4s)]
*  There's still a lot of activity there. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1206.4s)]
*  And, well, I guess we'll wait and see how that all shakes out. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1209.4s)]
*  I want to ask you about Syria. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1212.4s)]
*  It looks like normalization is coming soon. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1214.4s)]
*  Amid Sakhia Nadenbi just met with Ahmed Al-Shara in the UAE. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1216.4s)]
*  That I could not have ever imagined before October 7th. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1220.4s)]
*  So is the transformation of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, do you think it's real? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1224.4s)]
*  Do you think that this organization, once Al-Qaeda, is now truly about moderation? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1229.4s)]
*  Is it truly about normalization? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1236.4s)]
*  Or are they doing this just to survive? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1238.4s)]
*  First of all, they're doing this to survive because, you know, all the issues in the region are common. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1243.4s)]
*  I mean, all the issues are related. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1252.4s)]
*  And I think that trying to control, to see how we control the country, try to get legitimacy outside and inside. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1255.4s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1267.4s)]
*  It's not easy because we see that there are people inside Syria that, you know, they have doubts. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1268.4s)]
*  They have doubts. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1276.4s)]
*  And also here in Israel. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1277.4s)]
*  So, by the way, as I know, the reports about the meeting between Sakhia Nadenbi and Al-Shara in UAE are not true. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1278.4s)]
*  But there is dialogue. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1288.4s)]
*  There is dialogue between the two countries via a lot of media. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1290.4s)]
*  And in the first phase, it will be a security package. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1303.4s)]
*  Because what is important for the Syrian side is how I say that Israel will not be in South Syria. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1312.4s)]
*  All the positions that Israel found there after the fall of Assad regime. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1323.4s)]
*  But I think that in the second phase, yeah, it can be, it can cause to normalization lately. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1329.4s)]
*  But I don't think it's right now, Jonathan. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1337.4s)]
*  We have to be, I think, very, as I see it, it's very positive, but it will take time. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1340.4s)]
*  And again, we have to understand that, OK, even if Ahmad al-Shara wants it, OK, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1350.4s)]
*  the circle of Ahmad al-Shara is not less important. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1357.4s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is that the problem in Syria today that even if Ahmad al-Shara wants something, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1362.4s)]
*  is counterparts. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1371.4s)]
*  And even now, the HTA is not a terror organization. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1374.4s)]
*  Maybe we'll take the conservative side. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1382.4s)]
*  And what I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of components to Ahmad al-Shara in Syria. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1390.4s)]
*  A lot of people that trying to weight him to the most, to the most, the Iranians, Hezbollah, ISIS. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1398.4s)]
*  And also, I think in his circle, there are people that say, wow, how you go to peace? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1408.4s)]
*  So maybe a reconciliation with Israel. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1416.4s)]
*  All right, it looks like we've got some technical problems. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmzpU10F4M&t=1421.4s)]
