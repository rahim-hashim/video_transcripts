# FDD Morning Brief  feat. Col. Richard Kemp (Jul. 7)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs)
*  Good morning. It's Monday, July 7th. The multi front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=0.0s)]
*  640 days old. I'm your host, Jonathan Schanzer. Hope you had a meaningful and enjoyable Independence [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=23.52s)]
*  Day weekend. Welcome back to the FTD Morning Brief. The Israelis carried out airstrikes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=29.8s)]
*  on a series of strategic Houthi targets yesterday. The Yemeni terror group seems to be the only [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=35.04s)]
*  Iranian proxy that is still capable of posing a strategic threat to Israel right now. That's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=40.24s)]
*  because the group has ballistic missile capabilities. Thankfully, Israel has destroyed much of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=45.6s)]
*  Iranian capability to produce those weapons. So over time, those Houthi attacks may slow, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=50.92s)]
*  Israel to find meaningful targets in Yemen with so many other active fronts closer to home. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=57.46s)]
*  But now that the fighting with Iran and its other proxies has slowed, Israel seems to have the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=62.38s)]
*  bandwidth to start hunting for top leaders. Here's looking at you, Abdul Malik al Houthi. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=67.86s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touched down earlier this morning at Andrews Air Force [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=73.18s)]
*  Base just outside of Washington, D.C. Some fascinating decisions for the Israeli leader [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=78.62s)]
*  as he faces calls to end the war in Gaza. I would love to be able to predict the future here, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=83.58s)]
*  folks, but let's be honest, I can barely predict the past. So we're going to be weighing in on [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=88.62s)]
*  that on Wednesday right here on the FTD Morning Brief. Today's guest is Colonel Richard Kamper, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=93.1s)]
*  a former British Army commander and terrorism expert who in the early 2000s headed the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  International Terrorism Team at the UK government's Joint Intelligence Committee. He's also recently [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=104.78s)]
*  been on the ground in Gaza with the 12-day war now in the rear view and global attention [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=110.3s)]
*  refocusing on Israel's fight against Hamas. He is the ideal guest to help us make sense of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=115.1s)]
*  Gaza aid distribution, talks of a possible ceasefire and much more. So stay tuned for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  that conversation in just a few minutes. Some fascinating news in the Palestinian arena this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=125.34s)]
*  weekend. Four sheikhs from the city of Hebron want to separate from the Palestinian Authority, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=131.74s)]
*  establish an independent emirate and make peace with Israel. This has been percolating for a while. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=136.86s)]
*  The idea is to establish multiple emirates across Palestinian population centers. Given how [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=142.46s)]
*  Palestinians identify primarily with local clans, families and tribes, this thing might just work. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  I first heard about this concept from Israeli academic Mordechai Kedar a decade ago. Then [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=153.58s)]
*  recently, Likud Knesset member and former Jerusalem mayor near Barakot embraced it. Barakot's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=158.94000000000003s)]
*  initiative has some economic perks too. Reportedly, his plan envisions Israel admitting 1,000 workers [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=165.1s)]
*  from Hebron for a trial period and then adding 5,000 more if everything works out. Eventually, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  up to 50,000 Palestinians from Hebron could work inside the state of Israel. It all sounds promising, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  but a few caveats. First, many Israelis will oppose Palestinian autonomy in Hebron. The city, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=183.34s)]
*  after all, holds major significance for Jews. Second, if the plan takes off, the emirates may [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=188.7s)]
*  ultimately want to join together in pursuit of statehood. In other words, this whole thing could [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=194.38s)]
*  take us back to the two-state paradigm, which most Israelis want to avoid like the bubonic plague. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=198.54s)]
*  Third, I'm still trying to figure out if these sheiks have any pull in Hebron. But for now, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=204.78s)]
*  this is good news. It's a rebuke of the corrupt Palestinian authority. It's a departure from the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=209.34s)]
*  tired two-state paradigm. And it's a sign that Israel's victories since October 7th are indeed [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=214.46s)]
*  resonating across the region. Now for your headlines. Headline one, Hamas targeted two [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=220.06s)]
*  Americans over the weekend. On Saturday, two American personnel working for the Gaza Humanitarian [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  Foundation were injured when Hamas terrorists hurled grenades at an aid distribution site [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=232.14000000000001s)]
*  near the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis. GHF posted a picture of fragments from one of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=237.34s)]
*  grenades, which were packed with ball bearings. If you're curious about what that looks like, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=242.54s)]
*  you can find the image on X pretty easily. Oh, and no shocker here. Those grenades were Iranian [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=247.5s)]
*  made. GHF says Hamas deliberately targeted the Americans and then courageously after lobbying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=253.02s)]
*  the grenade aid workers, the terrorists ran into a crowd of Palestinian civilians. Super courageous. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=258.86s)]
*  Thankfully, the IDF helped evacuate the Americans who are now in stable condition. A reminder here [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=264.7s)]
*  that GHF is sacrificing life and limb to feed Palestinians and to change the corrupt aid [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=269.66s)]
*  distribution paradigm in Gaza. The organization has dispirited 60 plus million meals since it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=275.34s)]
*  opened for business in May. Headline two, Turkish authorities arrested the mayors of three Turkish [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  cities. All three mayors belong to the Republican People's Party. CHP is Turkey's main opposition [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=287.34s)]
*  party. These arrests come four months after Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was thrown in jail [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=293.58s)]
*  on corruption charges. That arrest sent hundreds of thousands of Turks into the streets in protest. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  But the fear ultimately subsided. Sadly, Imamoglu remains in jail. A reminder here that Turkey is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=305.34s)]
*  anything but a democracy these days. Since July 1st, Turkish authorities have arrested more than [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=311.58s)]
*  100 officials, including current and former mayors. They're all facing corruption allegations, which [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=317.02s)]
*  is pretty rich. Given the corruption of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his family and his cronies, they have [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  built the system in Turkey for more than two decades and counting. Headline three, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=328.94s)]
*  yesterday the IDF in Shin Bet confirmed the elimination of a senior Hamas commander. I gotta [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=334.46s)]
*  be honest here. I didn't think there was a senior Hamas commander left, but apparently they found [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=339.1s)]
*  one. His name was Rami Ramzi Ramadan Abdali Saleh. He was the commander of Hamas's naval force in [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=344.62s)]
*  northern Gaza. According to the IDF, he was key to Hamas's maritime capabilities and he was actively [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=352.06s)]
*  planning attacks against Israeli troops. Saleh was meeting with other Hamas operatives, including [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=357.5s)]
*  the deputy head of Hamas's mortar unit. So that's two leaders that were killed in one stroke. The [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=362.14s)]
*  strike that took Saleh out was a joint operation. The Israeli Air Force, Navy, military intelligence, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=368.06s)]
*  and the Shin Bet all took part. That kind of teamwork was what made the IDF so lethal in Lebanon. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=373.74s)]
*  And don't forget Iran too. All right, it's time to dive into that conversation with Colonel [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=379.9s)]
*  Richard Kemp. Tune in for the military knowledge. Stay for the British accent. Let's get to it, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=385.42s)]
*  shall we? Welcome to the program, Richard Kemp. Thank you. It's really good to be with you, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=390.62s)]
*  Jonathan. And I always enjoy working alongside FDD and I draw a huge amount on the excellent [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=399.42s)]
*  work that you do. Ah, kind of you to say. We learn a lot from you as well and it's a pleasure to host [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=406.3s)]
*  you this morning. I want to start with how Israel is doing in Gaza. I know you were just there. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=411.26s)]
*  I know that there are women, but I know we've also reached a point of diminishing returns, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=417.42s)]
*  or at least that's what it seems. And it also seems that Benjamin Netanyahu is going to come [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=422.14s)]
*  under some pressure today from Donald Trump to end the war. Are we at that point of diminishing [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=426.53999999999996s)]
*  returns? I don't believe we are. I think the war has taken a hell of a long time, as we all know, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  only too well. But that's really down to three main reasons. I think the first one is the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=438.86s)]
*  presence of the hostages, which obviously has meant that the IDF has had to operate far more [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  cautiously than they otherwise would. And that's obviously important. Secondly, because of the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=449.74s)]
*  extent of restraint that was placed on the IDF and on Israel generally by the Biden [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=456.22s)]
*  administration, which slowed things down a lot inside Gaza. And thirdly, of course, because [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=463.42s)]
*  the IDF was having to focus a lot of its military efforts on Lebanon against Hezbollah. And now that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=468.62s)]
*  threat has not gone but is significantly diminished. I think the IDF is able to apply more power now [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=475.02000000000004s)]
*  into Gaza. And I think it's probably, people have said this before, but I think it's probably a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=481.82s)]
*  relatively short time before Hamas is taken out of the game. Not totally, of course, not going to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=488.14s)]
*  kill every terrorist, but certainly sufficient damage for them to no longer present a threat to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=494.86s)]
*  Israel. And I think it would be a bad thing if President Trump applied pressure on Prime [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=501.74s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu now to stop the war and effectively to seize defeat from the jaws of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=507.9s)]
*  victory. Yeah, I do think, though, that at least it looks to me like Bibi is ready to, I don't know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=514.78s)]
*  perhaps yield to Donald Trump. Of course, Donald Trump has helped him immensely in the Iran theater. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=522.38s)]
*  And we did see the Prime Minister go to the southern envelope for the first time since the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=528.78s)]
*  war erupted and meet with families. It did get a sense that he was giving a nod to the hostage [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=534.62s)]
*  families. But I guess we'll have to wait and see. The Prime Minister arrived at Blair House this [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=540.62s)]
*  morning across the street from the White House, and he'll be taking that meeting a little bit later [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=544.78s)]
*  today with the President. But for now, as we talk about Hamas' possible defeat, I am curious. Part of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  it really does have to do with the administrative control that Hamas has sustained in Gaza. So if [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  you would just talk to us a little bit about the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. How is the GHF doing, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=562.9399999999999s)]
*  and is it undermining Hamas' ability to administer the Gaza Strip as we've heard? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=568.22s)]
*  Yeah, I visited two of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid distribution sites inside Gaza [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=574.0600000000001s)]
*  in the last 10 days. And to me, this could be a turning point in the conflict, as you kind of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=581.58s)]
*  alluded to, depriving Hamas of the ability to control aid, which allows them, first of all, to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=588.86s)]
*  to gain funds for their terrorist operations. Secondly, to control the civilian population in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=595.9s)]
*  Gaza in a way they couldn't do if they don't control the aid. GHF, I was going to say FDD, but [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=605.5s)]
*  I'm sure... We're not on the ground there, not yet. Not yet. But GHF has been doing remarkable [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=612.94s)]
*  work, and it's been extremely well received by the civilian population in Gaza. I must have spoken [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  to at least 50 Gazan civilians collecting aid at each of the two distribution sites I've visited. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=624.78s)]
*  They were extremely grateful for what they're being given, and many of them said it's the first time [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=631.1s)]
*  they've received free aid since the war began. The rest of the time they've had to buy aid, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=635.9s)]
*  which has been seized by Hamas and sold in local marketplaces. So very grateful to the GHF, and [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=641.18s)]
*  very grateful to the United States. Of course, they identify the GHF directly with the United States, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=648.3s)]
*  and I heard chants like, I love America, I love Trump, and from a lot of people there. And also, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=654.3s)]
*  I hate Hamas, kill Hamas. There's clearly a very strong mood against Hamas among the ordinary [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=662.3s)]
*  people in Gaza. Now, that doesn't necessarily translate into a significant uprising against [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=668.54s)]
*  Hamas, but I think it does tell a story. And the third thing that I saw in the GHF sites was, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=673.5799999999999s)]
*  or heard about, was how most of the people told me they want to get out of Gaza. They see no [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=679.6600000000001s)]
*  future in Gaza. They want to leave. And one final point on it, I'm happy to take any other questions [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=684.94s)]
*  on the GHF, but one final point is we shouldn't forget that the two main opponents of the GHF are [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  one, Hamas, for obvious reasons, and two, the United Nations. Let that sink in. The enemies of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=699.6600000000001s)]
*  this new aid distribution system, which is appreciated by the Gazans, are Hamas and the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=707.26s)]
*  United Nations. Enemies both. I will say that the chants that you heard about, you know, we love [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=712.9399999999999s)]
*  America, we love Trump, we hate Hamas, if only I could hear those chants on American college [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=719.9s)]
*  campuses right now. I mean, really just remarkable to me that you're hearing that from the Gazans, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=725.8199999999999s)]
*  and that we hear this other garbage on American college campuses. But I think you're absolutely [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=731.58s)]
*  right about the importance of noting that it's really the corrupt NGOs that have benefited from [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=736.3s)]
*  the aid system for so long, and that have worked hand in glove with Hamas for so long, that they're [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=742.6999999999999s)]
*  the ones who've been sniping at GHF. They're the ones who've been taking the pot shots. And so [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=748.62s)]
*  I'm glad to hear that they're having some success. I wish them more success. I'm glad you had an [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=754.62s)]
*  opportunity to be able to go there, to witness it, and to be able to report back. I want to get back [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=758.78s)]
*  to this idea of a ceasefire, because, you know, we've heard that the United States is pushing [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=765.42s)]
*  Israel to either end the war permanently, or perhaps enter into a 60-day ceasefire with the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=768.9399999999999s)]
*  goal of eventually ending the war permanently in Gaza. I mean, let me ask you, if Hamas released [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=774.2199999999999s)]
*  the hostages, would that do it alone for you? Do you think that would be enough for Israel to say, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=780.3s)]
*  okay, look, they've been through this for a year and a half. They've been fighting. They're exhausted. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=785.9799999999999s)]
*  They were fighting on seven fronts. They just went through this harrowing experience with Iran [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=790.78s)]
*  launching 500 ballistic missiles and 1,000 drones into Israeli airspace. I mean, you do get a sense [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=795.9s)]
*  that the Israeli public is tired. You get a sense that they are ready for a rest. I mean, maybe play [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=802.62s)]
*  this out for us. Does a temporary ceasefire do anything for us? Does the return of hostages do [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=808.78s)]
*  anything for us? Or do you really think that you need about another month or three months of fighting [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=814.06s)]
*  to finally end this? I mean, what's the logic as you think through this? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=819.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm somewhat skeptical that Hamas is going to release all of the hostages. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=823.42s)]
*  They're their only cards they've really got to play. They may release some if there is a deal, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=830.22s)]
*  but they're not going to release all of them. I'd be very surprised if they do. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=834.7s)]
*  And I don't think if they, even if they did release all of the hostages, unlikely, I don't [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=839.26s)]
*  think that's the end of the story. I think Hamas still is not very powerful now. It's lacking in [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=844.62s)]
*  its main supporter, Iran, now. Iran is now, I think, not destroyed, but to a large extent on [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=851.18s)]
*  its knees after its total humiliation in the 12-day war. And it is not in a position really to do very [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=859.66s)]
*  much for Hamas now. So I think Hamas is in a bad way, but has to be, I believe, completely defeated [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=865.5s)]
*  during this war. And I don't think from my, I spent a lot of time in Israel in the last month [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=875.58s)]
*  and in the last, the whole time pretty much since the 7th of October. I don't sense that the Israelis [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=880.46s)]
*  are ready to end this fight. I know there's division in Israel over Gaza specifically. There [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=887.5s)]
*  was absolutely no division in Israel during the 12-day war. They wanted to see Iran smashed to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=893.1s)]
*  pieces and they did see that. There is some division, but the division mainly revolves around [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=899.98s)]
*  the hostages. I don't think it represents exhaustion. Of course all Israelis want the [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=905.1800000000001s)]
*  war to end as quickly as possible, but they also know how much of a threat Hamas presents to them. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=909.4200000000001s)]
*  And so I think I would guess certainly from the discussions I've had with Israelis from across [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=915.4200000000001s)]
*  the spectrum, they want to see this war ended with the defeat of Hamas, not just with the release [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=920.94s)]
*  of the hostages. All right. We're going to have to wait and see. I do know that that pressure is [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=926.7s)]
*  building on Bibi, but I also know that his coalition is not necessarily eager to end this war. And [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=931.34s)]
*  neither is the IDF. I think as you suggest, I do think they understand that they need to fully [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=938.22s)]
*  neutralize that threat before they go back to whatever normal once looked like in the Middle [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=943.98s)]
*  East. I'm having a hard time remembering that. Speaking of normal though, what does a good day [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=948.62s)]
*  after plan look like to you? We hear a lot about day after plans. We know the Israelis don't want [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=954.62s)]
*  Hamas. We know they don't want the Palestinian authority. We've heard about foreign actors like [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=959.9s)]
*  the UAE or Saudi Arabia. Now we're hearing about local players on the ground that can possibly do [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=964.94s)]
*  the job. In your view, and you've done this before, you're an expert in urban warfare and [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=969.9s)]
*  counterterrorism. What does this look like to you if it's going to be a success? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=974.46s)]
*  Well, I think in many ways it has to be a combination of all those things. And I know [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=979.6600000000001s)]
*  the Israelis have been working on, shall we say, the day after ever since this war began. People [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=983.82s)]
*  say there's no plan. There's no consideration. There is a lot of consideration, a lot of planning [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=989.1800000000001s)]
*  been going on. I don't say there's a firm plan yet, and it may not be possible to actually develop [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=993.58s)]
*  a firm plan until the day after begins. But I think the first thing I would say that has to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=999.26s)]
*  happen, in my opinion, is that Israel has to maintain overall security control inside Gaza. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1006.22s)]
*  It cannot allow, because even if Hamas is smashed up, something's going to replace it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1013.8199999999999s)]
*  There is going to be a successor to Hamas of some sort, and therefore the IDF cannot allow [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1021.02s)]
*  that to develop as it did before the 7th of October. So they have to maintain [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1027.18s)]
*  close security control of Gaza. I think the overall management of Gaza, the reconstruction, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1031.98s)]
*  if it's going to take place, the day-to-day running of the Strip, is something that neither [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1039.02s)]
*  the Israeli government nor the IDF actually want to take responsibility for, and I can understand [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1045.3400000000001s)]
*  absolutely why that is. And so I think probably the ideal would be some form of consortium of Arab [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1049.74s)]
*  States like the UAE, possibly Egypt, Saudi Arabia, other countries to help finance and [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1056.54s)]
*  oversee the running of the Gaza Strip. And then ideally, the day-to-day control and management [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1063.02s)]
*  in detail of the Strip would best be done by Gazans themselves, if sufficient Gazans with enough [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1070.62s)]
*  authority can be found to actually take on that responsibility who haven't been supporters of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1077.5s)]
*  Hamas. So it's not a great answer to your question, but I think that's probably the ideal [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1083.26s)]
*  combination of layers of control of Gaza for the future. Yeah, I mean, look, there is no great [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1088.06s)]
*  answer. I've heard some of the Israeli plans and I've heard some of the outside plans, and I haven't [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1094.06s)]
*  been really bowled over by any of them. I mean, I think what I would agree with what you said up [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1098.22s)]
*  front, which is that you can't really create a day-after scenario until the day after begins, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1104.62s)]
*  and you need to have that defeat of Hamas to be able to inspire confidence in those that might [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1110.7s)]
*  even take over the Gaza Strip. If they still believe that Hamas is there and that Hamas has [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1115.74s)]
*  a significant hold on power, then it's going to be very hard to convince any of these actors that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1119.98s)]
*  it's worth their while to put one foot on the ground, knowing that they could be killed, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1126.38s)]
*  knowing that they could be targeted by Hamas. So I think I generally align with where you are, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1131.02s)]
*  and I'm very curious to see where this thing all heads after the discussion between Bibi and Trump [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1136.8600000000001s)]
*  today. Last question before I let you go. You're a veteran of the British military. Perhaps you can [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1141.02s)]
*  tell us a little bit about how the British Navy has engaged the Houthis. I understand that they [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1146.54s)]
*  were actually exchanging fire with the Houthis yesterday. I know that they also have, the British [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1151.34s)]
*  Air Force has been scrambling out of Cyprus, at least last year, to down Iranian drones. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1159.98s)]
*  Haven't heard much about that lately. So how involved is the UK right now in this war in the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1165.26s)]
*  Middle East? We just don't hear about it very much on this program. Yeah, I was very encouraged last [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1171.34s)]
*  year to see the Royal Air Force taking a part in defending Israel against Iranian missiles and [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1176.94s)]
*  drones. That was encouraging indeed. But we haven't seen anything, to my knowledge, we haven't seen [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1183.26s)]
*  anything in the latest attack from Iran or against Iran and Iran's retaliation. We haven't seen [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1188.46s)]
*  anything to indicate that the British have been directly involved in supporting Israel, which is [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1194.46s)]
*  a disappointment. I know they deployed significant numbers of combat planes to Cyprus at the start of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1200.22s)]
*  the 12-day war, but I don't think they were used. And I suspect the British government will be [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1206.46s)]
*  reluctant to use them in support of Israel. Maybe they were there in order to protect the British [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1211.58s)]
*  sovereign bases in Cyprus and Cyprus itself if that came under attack from Iran. But [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1217.58s)]
*  Britain, since the new government, the Labour government took over last year, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1223.5s)]
*  Britain has taken a very different attitude towards Israel. And that includes [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1228.78s)]
*  imposing a partial arms embargo on Israel. It includes imposing sanctions on Israeli elected [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1235.3400000000001s)]
*  government ministers and too much sniping from the sidelines against Israel. So I think we've got a [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1242.3s)]
*  government now that doesn't pay much attention to what should properly be its foreign policy [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1249.26s)]
*  objectives. Its foreign policy and its policy towards Israel is dictated much more by the mobs [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1255.66s)]
*  on the streets of London, by the huge number of Labour supporters who are vehemently opposed to [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1261.74s)]
*  Israel. And those things are driving, you know, every week, sometimes every day on the streets [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1268.46s)]
*  of London on university campuses, we see a huge amount of anti-Israel hate and anti-Jew hate as [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1276.22s)]
*  well, by the way. And that's what's driving, I think, government policy. And it shouldn't be. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1281.98s)]
*  It should recognise the threat that we face from the same jihadist attacks as Israel faces. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1287.34s)]
*  And today actually is the 20th anniversary of the 7th of July bombings in London, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1294.54s)]
*  four suicide bombing attacks, in which, by the way, Israel was extremely helpful in assisting our [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1300.0600000000002s)]
*  follow-up to those attacks. I was involved myself directly in the intelligence world then, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1308.6200000000001s)]
*  and I know Israel was very, very useful to us. And we should take a leaf out of Israel's books [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1313.98s)]
*  and support Israel totally, strongly, and not do all this, as I mentioned, sniping from the sidelines [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1320.22s)]
*  when we're both facing the same threat. We should particularly, I think, be thankful to Israel [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1326.94s)]
*  for what it did to Iran. Now, the Iran problem is not over, we know that, but Iran, a nuclear-armed [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1332.14s)]
*  Iran, represented the same threat, or pretty much the same threat, to Europe in the longer term as [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1338.6200000000001s)]
*  it did to Israel and the Middle East in the shorter term. We should be very thankful to Israel for what [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1344.8600000000001s)]
*  it did. Fully agree. All right, we're going to leave it there. I want to thank you, Colonel Richard [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYIhncPq0cs&t=1349.5s)]
