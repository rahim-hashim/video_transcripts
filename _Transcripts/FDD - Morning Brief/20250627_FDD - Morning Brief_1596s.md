# FDD Morning Brief | feat. BG (Res.) Prof. Jacob Nagel (Jun. 27)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU)
*  Good morning. It's Friday, June 27th. The multi front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=0.0s)]
*  630 days old. I'm your host, Jonathan Schanzer. Welcome back yet again to the FDD Morning Brief. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=24.24s)]
*  The news is still coming at us fast and furious. It's still akin to drinking from a fire hose. So [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  we're going to keep with our sit rep format today with the expectation. We're going to revert back [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=36.72s)]
*  to that regular format next week. But as of this morning, let's review what's going on here. We've [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=42.0s)]
*  got the supreme leader of Iran defiantly tweeting at Israel in the United States, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=48.08s)]
*  insisting that he did not lose this war, insisting that the United States had to come in to save [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  Israel at the last minute. But that is not what we're hearing out of Israel right now as the news [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=60.4s)]
*  continues to trickle out about what exactly the Israelis were able to do from within Iranian [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  territory and from without. The reports from the Wall Street Journal, the videos coming out of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=72.48s)]
*  IDF show a remarkable, remarkable military operation carried out over the course of years [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=78.16s)]
*  and years of planning, flawless execution, and maybe a little bit of luck as well. But the end [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=85.84s)]
*  result being that more than 11 or at least 11 nuclear scientists killed, including one [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=92.64s)]
*  purportedly yesterday, they're gone. IRGC leaders, military leaders, military infrastructure, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=99.2s)]
*  ballistic missiles, ballistic missile production facilities, all of it gone. The Israelis, of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=107.12s)]
*  course, continue to leak out this information. It continues to undermine the regime in Iran, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=112.88s)]
*  casting doubt about its leadership, casting doubt about its ability to continue to maintain [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=119.68s)]
*  control of this territory as the people of Iran continue to weigh their options in terms of whether [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=125.52s)]
*  they want to rise up. We're going to continue to watch that. In the meantime, we've got Hezbollah [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=132.72s)]
*  taking its lumps yesterday as the Israelis attacked a specific target in what is known [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=138.88s)]
*  as Beaufort Ridge, as Hezbollah continues occasionally to try to build back what was [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=143.92s)]
*  destroyed over the course of the last year. But my eyes remain on Gaza. That's where the fighting [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=149.28s)]
*  is now resuming at a previous pitch. We're going to be watching that closely for signs of possible, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=155.28s)]
*  possible negotiations, possible diplomacy. But right now, a lot is still up in the air. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=162.08s)]
*  With that, what we're going to do is we are going to turn to a pre-recorded conversation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=169.44s)]
*  with Jacob Nagel. We're going to be playing that in just a moment. Jacob, you'll recall, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=174.32s)]
*  is a former national security advisor to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He was the head of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=178.56s)]
*  what was known as the Nagel Committee, the most recent Nagel Committee that assessed Israel's needs [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=184.8s)]
*  in terms of military buildup over the next several years with the expectation that there was going to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=190.24s)]
*  be a war with Iran. Well, that war has already transpired. I don't know what that means for the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=195.52s)]
*  military buildup, but I do know that Jacob was able to answer just about every question I threw [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=202.08s)]
*  at him yesterday. So we're going to tee up that interview now. I'm going to keep watching the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=208.08s)]
*  headlines as we play that interview. We'll return back to me and we'll close out the program. But [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=212.88s)]
*  for now, sit back, have a listen to my conversation with Jacob Nagel. Welcome to the program, Jacob [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=218.32s)]
*  Nagel. Thank you very much for having me on your program. Long time since I was here last time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=226.96s)]
*  Well, we'll make sure you come back again soon. I want to ask you to start with where we are with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  the so-called BDA. We saw Donald Trump come out and say that the program was obliterated. Then we [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=241.2s)]
*  saw comments from Pete Hegseth, our Secretary of Defense, saying that a lot of damage was done. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=248.0s)]
*  Then we saw the DIA say that maybe not a lot of damage was done. Then we saw the CIA say that a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=254.16s)]
*  lot of damage was done. Then we saw the Israelis come out and say it was a lot of damage. Trust us. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=259.68s)]
*  Is it a lot of damage? Are we still learning? What do we still need to learn? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=265.2s)]
*  First of all, it's good that there are many, many people that are talking about something that they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=268.96s)]
*  don't know what they're talking about. So I will just, you know, you know, there is some very serious [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=275.76s)]
*  people in Israel. For example, the Israeli atomic agency, Commissioner and the others, and they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=284.0s)]
*  went out with a very short message and read every word of this message. And it's really, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=293.36s)]
*  really professional. But what I'm saying is that a BDA is something that takes time. You know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=300.88s)]
*  sometimes you eat a truck. Then you see the truck is not there or the truck is there. But when you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=307.6s)]
*  eat three very, very, very, very widespread nuclear facilities like Natanz, Com and Isfan, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=314.0s)]
*  some of them are buried underground for, you know, underground. And the US is using for the first [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=324.72s)]
*  time the mop and other things. Believe me, there is a big, big, big damage to those facilities. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=333.6s)]
*  And of course, we know that there are all these other facilities that have been destroyed. If you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=342.88s)]
*  can't convert the enriched uranium metal, then, you know, what's the threat? But I do want to ask, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=346.4s)]
*  you know, I think we now see the logic of why people are saying that the nuclear program [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=353.44s)]
*  has been set back by years. I think I agree with that. It sounds like that's where Israel is. And [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=360.24s)]
*  I think it's where the majority of the US intelligence agencies are right now. And I think [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=365.84s)]
*  that's probably what's going to be in the final BDA, whether it's two years, five years, 10 years. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=370.32s)]
*  I don't know, but it's been set back significantly. Israel and the Middle East are safer. But the one [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=375.92s)]
*  thing that keeps coming up, and I do want to ask you about this, we heard about these trucks, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=381.2s)]
*  that they were possibly carrying the 60% enriched uranium. Now, I understand that you can't just [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  simply take 60% enriched uranium and make a bomb out of it. But is there a risk that there is loose [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=393.36s)]
*  uranium out there that the Iranians have? Is that a concern for you? Or do you think that it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=400.16s)]
*  doesn't matter? I'll never say it doesn't matter. But before I'm going answering your question, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  and I will answer the maximum that I can go into. But when some people are saying, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=413.36s)]
*  the program is being set 10 years, 20 years, everything above five, those people that are [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  saying those things, they don't know what they're talking about. Because if a country is going to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=428.24s)]
*  start to build a bomb from nothing, from zero, it will take them four or five years. So you cannot [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=433.44s)]
*  set back a country for more than five years. So everyone that is talking about 10 or 20 years, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  he doesn't know what he's talking about. Now about those 409 kilos of enriched uranium that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=445.92s)]
*  went from 280 from the last report showing us how fast the Iranians are approaching to the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=455.76s)]
*  really, really industrial size of enrichment. Now, this is an important part of the bomb. You need [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=465.2s)]
*  fissile material, you need the weaponization part, and you need the missile, the means of delivery. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  So 400 kilos of enriched uranium, yes, this is a problem. Now, the answer, where are they? Believe me, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=481.04s)]
*  don't believe everyone that is telling you. Because I think that not too many people know. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=490.88s)]
*  It was in the beginning in Isfahan. Probably it moved to Fordow. No one knows if all the 400 [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=496.16s)]
*  moved to Fordow or only part of it and part remained in Isfahan. And then it went out on [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  maybe those trucks, maybe not these trucks. No one knows because I'm not sure that those trucks took [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=509.6s)]
*  this enriched uranium or not. No one knows. So now we have those 400 kilos in one of three places. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=515.44s)]
*  In Isfahan, under the rebels, in Fordow under the rebels, or in trucks that went to some place. And [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=523.52s)]
*  believe me, if they went, someone like Israel will know where they went. Some people ask why, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=530.96s)]
*  if it is the enriched uranium, why someone didn't eat it? It's a long question, long answer. But no [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=538.0s)]
*  one knows exactly where. It's important, but people are making for it too much. Yeah, I tend to think [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=546.64s)]
*  so too, because I don't think it's possible right now for the regime to make a nuke with whatever [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=554.16s)]
*  enriched uranium may have finally gotten out. And I do think that they seem to be making a lot more [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=560.0s)]
*  of this for those that I think are trying to make the argument that the United States didn't finish [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=566.16s)]
*  the job that Israel started. The problem is that more you're talking about it and someone is showing [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=572.8s)]
*  the Iranians that maybe you are, you know, worried about it. The Iranians are already talking of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  making leverage out of it. Again, it's not a bargain chip. It's something that you'll have [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=585.68s)]
*  to give up, but it's not something that you have to pay for it too much. It's important. It was more [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=592.0s)]
*  important when they have, as you said, the facilities to make from this uranium, uranium [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=597.68s)]
*  metal and other things. Now they don't have it. It's important, but we will take care of it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=607.28s)]
*  Okay. All right. Now you mentioned negotiations. I need to ask you about this because, you know, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=613.84s)]
*  you and I have talked about this not on camera, but I want to ask you about it now. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=619.44s)]
*  This idea that we're going to start negotiating, that Stephen Witkoff is going to go back and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  start talking to the Iranians. I don't know if it's going to be in Doha or in Muscat or in some [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  other traitorous country that is working against American interests and absolutely working against [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=634.0s)]
*  Israeli interests. But let's say they have this sit down and let's say they talk. I mean, we're [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=639.44s)]
*  already seeing that the Supreme Leader is not going to surrender, right? And we've seen that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=644.0s)]
*  there is also, you know, there are talks about uprisings. The Crown Prince, the former Crown [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=649.68s)]
*  Prince of Iran is calling for the Iranian people to come out into the streets. There are people [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=655.68s)]
*  talking about possible internal revolution. Maybe the Revolutionary Guards or some angry clerics [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=661.04s)]
*  might try to go after Khamenei. I don't know where all this goes, but if it actually goes to [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=667.6s)]
*  negotiations, right? And you don't have the toppling of the regime and you don't have surrender. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=673.6s)]
*  What does that look like? I mean, what does Israel want to see coming? I know, I think I know what [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. wants, which is just an end to the nuclear program. But for Israel, you're talking about [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=684.56s)]
*  proxies. You're talking about ballistic missiles. There's a lot of things that the regime still has [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=690.48s)]
*  that I think Israel would probably like to negotiate to bring an end to it. Is that possible [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  right now in your view? Talking about negotiations in this stage, I'm not ruling it out, but I have [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=702.0s)]
*  some preemptive conditions for it. And if you remember when we talked before the first round [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=713.2s)]
*  of Witkoff and Araki, and if I demanded it, then for sure I can demand it now when the situation [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=721.52s)]
*  is much better. We talked about proxies. We talked about the ring of fire. All of those [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=731.12s)]
*  things that Iran has had as a leverage on U.S., Israel, or someone else, they don't have it anymore. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=740.24s)]
*  Iran is totally naked. Iran is open. The Israeli Air Force has total air superiority [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=748.24s)]
*  above Iran. So what they're talking about negotiating. Now you want to negotiate [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=757.28s)]
*  what I would put on the table. And again, I see some of the good things coming out of what U.S. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=762.88s)]
*  wants from Iran. But I'm putting for the negotiations, I'm putting before you start [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=769.52s)]
*  negotiating, you have to do actions. Now some of the actions that I asked before Iran cannot [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=777.76s)]
*  do anymore because they cannot give up some of their facilities because they don't have it anymore. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=785.36s)]
*  But Iran should declare, we are not going to enrich. We are not going to reproduce. We are [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=790.64s)]
*  not going to do all the things that are part of a military nuclear program. It's interesting to me [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=799.12s)]
*  that you didn't mention missiles. And look, I know... I'll come to it in a moment. Okay. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=808.0s)]
*  But let's put it out there, right? Israel just sustained something like 500 missiles from Iran, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=813.76s)]
*  ballistic missiles, serious heavy missiles that did a lot of damage. I know that the damage report [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=821.68s)]
*  that we saw that you've looked at is way better than what Israel expected at the beginning of this [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=828.0s)]
*  war, knowing that especially if Hezbollah was still capable of firing missiles and had Israel [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  not destroyed Iran's air defenses before going in, it could have been a lot worse. But it was [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=842.24s)]
*  still a significant threat to Israel and it did significant damage. How does Israel think about [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=847.6s)]
*  this right now? I mean, I know you said the skies are open, but if Israel goes back into Iran for [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=854.16s)]
*  any reason, it seems like probably a safe bet that more ballistic missiles fly at Israel. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=859.36s)]
*  Is that just going to be the cost of doing business from now on from your perspective, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=866.64s)]
*  or can this be negotiated too? I think it can be negotiated. Before we were talking always about [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=870.4s)]
*  the three parts of the nuclear program, Iran always claimed that they have their ballistic missiles [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=878.16s)]
*  for defending themselves. Yes, this is defending. We saw what is happening. And again, you're totally [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=886.56s)]
*  right, Jonathan. We expected mostly in the life cost that again, every life is very, very important, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=892.8s)]
*  but the numbers are much, much, much lower than the number of casualties that we anticipated before. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=901.04s)]
*  Yes, we also took into consideration the Hezbollah as part of the missile barrage coming on Israel. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=909.28s)]
*  Now, you just touched a very important thing. We left to put the missiles inside. Why? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=918.16s)]
*  Because of the changes that Iran did in the last year. Before it was a program, 2,000 missiles, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  you can end the note. Iran decided for the last year to go to 10,000 missiles. They decided to go [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=931.92s)]
*  to all of them or most of them accurate missiles. They sent many accurate missiles and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=940.64s)]
*  non-accurate missiles in the last war, 12 days war. But 10,000 ballistic missiles, a few hundred [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=947.2s)]
*  kilos of explosion or explosives on each one of them. 10,000 believe me, they can cause damage [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=956.88s)]
*  very, very similar to a small nuclear bomb if you are talking about thousands of missiles that are [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=967.12s)]
*  PGMs, precision guided munitions. So yes, it's have to be part. Now you hit on the right questions about [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=974.16s)]
*  how an agreement can look like. Now I would love to have an agreement with me or in the US, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=982.7199999999999s)]
*  an agreement with Iran, the same that is in the north of Israel now is the Hezbollah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=991.76s)]
*  It's not simple to say that we will have the same agreement that we have with Lebanon, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=998.24s)]
*  with Iran. It's not simple to attack them again and again. Yeah, and look, I know you can't, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1003.6s)]
*  but I think Israel can declare what its own red lines are and can vow to attack. And of course, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1010.08s)]
*  when Iran lacks air defenses and they lack an air force, thanks to the great work of Israel, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1015.36s)]
*  you know, I think they have to listen. Whether they will always want to listen is another story. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1022.48s)]
*  And I think we've got some. But the problem is they have the ballistic missiles. They can use them. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1027.6s)]
*  Yeah, and they can use it again. And this will be one of the reasons why Israel may be less [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1033.04s)]
*  bold from time to time about attacking something that they don't like inside Iran versus what they [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1042.48s)]
*  do in Lebanon. Right now, if they attack something that they don't like in Lebanon, there's no cost [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1048.72s)]
*  to Israel. But there are various costs by attacking something in Iran. You could see all of this start [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1052.8s)]
*  all over again, right? Yes, it could be a price for Lebanon. It could be. They still have [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  few 10,000 or 50,000 missiles. They are not using them because they understand what will happen to [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  them. In Iran, it's a little bit different. But the question is, I see now 40 trucks go to [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1072.8799999999999s)]
*  Fordow or to Natanz trying to reconstruct these buildings there. Yeah, you're going to have to [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1080.24s)]
*  bomb it. Of course you're going to bomb it. You know what I want? I want the US to attack. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1085.04s)]
*  I want Israel to attack and US to threaten Iran and tell them if you will attack, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1089.6s)]
*  we will attack you again. So there is something you have to be there. It's a different kind of [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1095.36s)]
*  an agreement that I'm not sure how to orchestrate. I'm not sure anyone knows how to do it yet. Yeah, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1101.6s)]
*  it's very, very complicated. And I'm not sure that the president of the United States wants to go [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  back. I'm not sure the Israeli public wants to go back. And so I guess we're going to have to [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1112.4s)]
*  watch this. It's going to be very, very interesting. But thank you for playing out that scenario. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1117.3600000000001s)]
*  I have one last question for you, Jacob. And this is, you and I talked about it when I was in Israel [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1121.76s)]
*  a few weeks ago, just before the war began. And I'm just going to remind viewers that you said that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1128.5600000000002s)]
*  it probably wasn't going to happen until after Bibi's son got married. So I'm always going to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1134.3200000000002s)]
*  remember that. But I won't hold it against you. No, no, I was about to put the deception. It's [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1139.68s)]
*  okay. Right. You add ice water in your veins. But I want to ask you this. We're looking at, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1146.64s)]
*  obviously, the last big front, now that the guns are silent in Iran. And let's hope that they stay [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1153.76s)]
*  silent. And let's hope that a new arrangement is made. Things are quiet in Lebanon. They're quiet [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1161.04s)]
*  in Syria. In fact, we're hearing about normalization with Lebanon and Syria. I don't [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1166.8s)]
*  know if that's real or imagined. But okay, we're seeing really positive things. Iraq is quiet. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1170.72s)]
*  Even the Houthis are pretty quiet. They fired a couple of drones at Israel, but nothing that [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1177.3600000000001s)]
*  Israel couldn't handle. So when I look right now, we're back to the beginning. We're back to where [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1181.84s)]
*  it all started in Gaza. And when we talked about this, when I saw you a few weeks ago, we talked [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  about the question of whether Israel can end the war without bringing back all the hostages, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1192.32s)]
*  but make demands and basically say to Steven Witkoff, Israel's not fighting anymore, but we're [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  not going to let any construction get through to the Gaza Strip. Food, water, fine. That can come [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1204.08s)]
*  through, but no construction of anything until the hostages are released. Can you imagine a scenario [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1209.9199999999998s)]
*  where diplomacy is allowed to play out? Or do you think from the Israeli perspective right now [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1217.28s)]
*  that this is a, we're going right back to full on war in the Gaza Strip and of course Israel will be [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1222.8s)]
*  criticized heavily by the international community and all of the things that we just watched, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1230.0s)]
*  the positives, the victories that Israel has just achieved. I mean, my fear is that they will be [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1234.56s)]
*  erased after Israel gets stuck in the sands of Gaza again. Is there a way to avoid that right now? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1240.48s)]
*  There's obviously, there was tragedy the other day in Gaza, seven Israeli soldiers killed in one [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1247.28s)]
*  attack. Is there a way out of this right now other than going right back in and fighting some more? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1252.48s)]
*  Again, what I'm saying is that we are in an absurd way, we are in a situation where [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1258.8s)]
*  the weakest front that we had, the weakest one became the one that, the toughest one. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1270.64s)]
*  Now why? Because there is one, there are two differences from Gaza to the other fronts. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1278.16s)]
*  One of them of course is the hostages, the 50 hostages that we have to bring home as fast as [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1285.1200000000001s)]
*  possible. And the second thing is that even Iran, but of course Lebanon and other, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1292.0s)]
*  you know, there are terrorists, there are the IRGC or the Hezbollah or the other, but the people [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1298.96s)]
*  around them are not all terrorists. In Gaza, most of the people were part of Hamas. Now I'm not [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1308.64s)]
*  saying that all two million people in Gaza are terrorists, but if you will do an election now [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1316.16s)]
*  in Gaza, even now I think that 80% will vote for Hamas even so they don't like it. Now this is one [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1322.56s)]
*  problem, but what we can do, I don't agree with one of the scenarios that you said, okay Israel [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1331.28s)]
*  will go out and everything will be okay. No, we cannot go out from Gaza, especially from the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1338.24s)]
*  perimeter, from the Philadelphia corridor, from the other two corridors that we have, Morag and [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1345.44s)]
*  Netzerim and others, without making sure that the Hamas is eliminated by the way that they cannot [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1351.2s)]
*  control. They cannot control Gaza again and the PA is the same, cannot go instead of them. So we [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1360.0s)]
*  don't see any, I don't see any easy solution to end this confrontation. If there was no hostages [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1368.64s)]
*  in Gaza, this war would have finished a year ago, two years ago. Look, they are the weakest ones. How [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1376.72s)]
*  come it took us so fast in Lebanon or even in Iran? But the problem is that we are humanitarian. We [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1383.84s)]
*  don't want to hurt our people. We don't want to hurt the people that are in Gaza, our boys and [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1392.4s)]
*  and soldiers that are there. So we have to find a way of doing it. Everyone in the world [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1399.68s)]
*  should push the Hamas, not Israel. They are the ones that are in control. Yeah, and I think, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1407.36s)]
*  yeah, I will say just, you know, to end it here, I think, you know, we really do need to see pressure [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1412.56s)]
*  on Iran. We need pressure on Qatar. We need pressure on Turkey. That's where the United States should [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1417.68s)]
*  be putting its pressure right now. That's where Witkoff should be really leaning on these guys, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1422.72s)]
*  because I do think that after this war has ended, instead of pressuring Israel, you have to pressure [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1427.2s)]
*  the Hamas. I agree. I agree. Because it's not, it should not be only on Israel. I fully agree. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1431.52s)]
*  Jacob Nagel, this has been fascinating. You have helped us unpack some very complicated things. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1437.3600000000001s)]
*  I want to thank you for coming back and joining us on today's episode of the FTD Morning Brief. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1443.1200000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. I enjoyed it as usual. Thank you. Bye. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1448.72s)]
*  All right. That was terrific. I think a really wide-ranging discussion there with Jacob Nagel, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1451.6s)]
*  who has terrific access across the Israeli system, continues to engage with decision makers, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1460.24s)]
*  military folks, intel folks. I think he's got a really good grasp of what's going on, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1466.9599999999998s)]
*  and I hope that was useful to all of you. We're still watching the headlines here at FTD. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1472.24s)]
*  It has been quiet, and I think that is a good thing. Israelis are getting ready [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1477.6s)]
*  to head into Shabbat here, into the Sabbath. I've been watching the screen here for the last 20 [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGsuJ0ee4CU&t=1482.24s)]
