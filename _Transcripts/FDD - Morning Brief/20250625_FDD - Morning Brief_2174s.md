# FDD Morning Brief | SITREP feat. Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Conricus and Bradley Bowman (Jun. 25)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU)
*  U.S. President Donald Trump says that the Iranian nuclear program is destroyed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=0.0s)]
*  The Iranian regime acknowledging that it has suffered significant damage. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=25.86s)]
*  However, we are seeing reports coming out of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the DIA, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=31.06s)]
*  here in the United States, leaks coming out that perhaps the nuclear program was not set [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=37.62s)]
*  back far enough. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=43.18s)]
*  Lots of discussion right now swirling around on both sides of the Atlantic. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  We're still trying to parse this out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=49.94s)]
*  We're still trying to figure out just what was accomplished in those strikes first carried [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=51.9s)]
*  out by Israel over the course of almost 11 days. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=57.1s)]
*  Then we have the capstone strikes from the United States knocking out three facilities. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=60.7s)]
*  But again, unclear whether everything was accomplished that Donald Trump and Benjamin [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=66.86s)]
*  Netanyahu set out to do when this war began. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=72.02s)]
*  Meantime, Israelis coming back to whatever normal looks like after a year and a half [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=76.38000000000001s)]
*  of war. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=82.66s)]
*  They spent 12 days in shelter. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=83.66s)]
*  This was a harrowing week and a half for Israelis, almost two weeks for Israelis. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=86.5s)]
*  They're getting back to normal today and starting to sift through the rubble. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  We have some tough news coming out of the Gaza Strip this morning and a little bit of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=96.2s)]
*  confusion as it relates to the Home Front Command. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  Lots to unpack here today. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  Welcome back to the FTD Morning Brief. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=106.14s)]
*  I'm Jonathan Schanzer, Executive Director here at FTD. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=108.46s)]
*  I've got with me today Jonathan Konrykis, Senior Fellow at FTD, former International [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=111.86s)]
*  Spokesperson for the IDF. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=117.06s)]
*  We've also got Brad Bowman, the Senior Director of our Center on Military and Political Power [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=119.5s)]
*  and a guy who knows a few things about the US military. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=126.38s)]
*  We've got a terrific lineup here for you this morning. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=129.94s)]
*  We're going to keep going with this sitrep format for the FTD Morning Brief through at [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=133.94s)]
*  least the end of the week because there is just too much for me to unpack on my own and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=139.3s)]
*  we just need more help so we've got the right people to help us this morning. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  Jonathan Konrykis, I want to turn to you first. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=149.3s)]
*  I want to ask you about exactly what you are seeing right now in Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=152.5s)]
*  This has been a tough week for you and a tough week for 10 million other Israelis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=158.58s)]
*  You've been in shelter, you've been waiting for the bombardments, these ballistic missiles [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=163.38s)]
*  to stop penetrating Israeli airspace. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=169.26s)]
*  Even though a lot of them were neutralized on their way in, a lot of them did get through. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=172.38s)]
*  There's damage that Israel is sifting through this morning. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=178.14s)]
*  There are deaths, there are injuries, there's PTSD. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=180.94s)]
*  What is happening right now? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=184.68s)]
*  What is your assessment of how Israel has come out of this on the other side? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=186.26s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=190.82s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=192.9s)]
*  A pleasure always. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=194.38s)]
*  Yeah, a challenging more than a week. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  The numbers that are the most important, I think, are actually the amount of Israelis [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=201.14s)]
*  that don't have a home, that have been forced out of their homes because their houses were [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=205.78s)]
*  hit directly by Iranian ballistic missiles. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about a good few thousand Israelis that are currently in temporary housing, hotels, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=214.62s)]
*  or living with family. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=220.46s)]
*  That I think is the bottom line. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=223.34s)]
*  There's lots of other numbers flying around. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=225.94000000000003s)]
*  The amount of drones that were fired at Israel and intercepted, 99% out of 1,100 incoming [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=228.3s)]
*  UAVs were successfully intercepted by Israel and its allies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  The success rate of the Arrow and all of the other components of the Israeli air defense [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=239.86s)]
*  is somewhere between 80% and 85%, which is very high. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=246.34s)]
*  But then each and every ballistic missile that got through created tremendous damage [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=256.86s)]
*  We have one national infrastructure facility that was severely damaged. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=258.32s)]
*  That is the oil refinery in Haifa. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=263.72s)]
*  Three Israelis were killed there and significant damage was done actually taking that facility [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=266.26s)]
*  out of production. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=271.74s)]
*  We now have a serious issue with oil refinery and everything that relates to the oil industry [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=273.06s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=279.62s)]
*  Not so much spoken about, but serious impact there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=280.8s)]
*  Bottom line in terms of Israelis, I was very fortunate. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=285.5s)]
*  The only thing that me and my family had to do was run up and down to shelter. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=288.46s)]
*  Something similar to what the Wall Street Journal's correspondent, Sheyna, in Israel [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=293.54s)]
*  reflected on YouTube. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=299.82s)]
*  But for me, it's been relatively easy for many Israelis. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  It's been a very, very difficult situation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=305.22s)]
*  I think moving forward, Israel relies on many layers of security and active protection and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=308.42s)]
*  passive protection. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=316.86s)]
*  Up until now, the saying was and the working assumption was that if you're in your shelter, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=318.54s)]
*  you're going to be safe from whatever is impacting around. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  Sadly, we have had five Israelis killed in two separate incidents. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=327.86s)]
*  They were in their shelters, closed doors, and they were supposed to not be significantly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=333.18s)]
*  damaged, but unfortunately, a direct impact of a ballistic missile carrying between 500 [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=338.82s)]
*  and 600 kilograms of explosives simply obliterated those safe rooms. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=345.54s)]
*  So there will be structural and other consequences for this war in terms of the Israeli homefront. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=350.1s)]
*  But if we step aside from that for a second, we're coming back to the reality of continuing [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  the fighting in Gaza with sad news about seven Israeli soldiers that were killed in one incident [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=363.98s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip in Hanyunas. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=370.38s)]
*  We're coming back to political realities and bickering and infighting in between the different [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=372.78s)]
*  parties and the different elected officials, getting back to the toxic debates, and of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=377.58s)]
*  course, getting back to the reality of having still, despite dealing the Iranian regime [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=383.58s)]
*  quite a significant blow, which I'm sure we will assess, still having lots of terrorists [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=389.54s)]
*  around us that we need to defend ourselves against. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=394.5s)]
*  So I would say, to summarize, it's been a very eventful 12 days. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=397.41999999999996s)]
*  Israelis I think are brushing themselves off under significant attack, but by and large [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=404.02s)]
*  Israeli society holding strong and capable of dealing with the pressure because we are [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  battle-hardened. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=415.62s)]
*  And now looking forward and seeing, okay, where does this take us in terms of Gaza, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=417.09999999999997s)]
*  in terms of Hamas, in terms of direct relations or issues with the Iranians? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=421.62s)]
*  Lots of questions. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=428.78s)]
*  But I'm happy to see Israelis going back to work, shops opening, schools are back. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=431.18s)]
*  Not happy to see the traffic that is associated with that, but you can't have it without that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=436.96s)]
*  And Israelis are brushing themselves off and carrying on with work. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=442.94s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=446.38s)]
*  That's a great summary of I think what's going on in Israel right now. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=447.38s)]
*  Thank you for that, Jonathan. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=450.58000000000004s)]
*  Now I do want to turn to this BDA, Battle Damage Assessment and the ongoing iterations [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=451.7s)]
*  of all of it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=457.82s)]
*  I want to get to Brad in a minute for the U.S. side, but I do want to hear from you, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=459.38s)]
*  Jonathan. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=464.66s)]
*  I know you're plugged in to the Israeli security establishment, and I understand that what [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=465.66s)]
*  we're seeing right now is a discrepancy between what the Israelis have assessed, what the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=471.22s)]
*  U.S. president is saying, and what we've heard from the DIA in this leaked report. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=476.34s)]
*  And let me just say, when we see leaked intelligence out of any system, the Israeli system, the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=481.97999999999996s)]
*  American system, it is designed to be politicized. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  It is designed to be weaponized. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=492.29999999999995s)]
*  There was a message that was trying to be conveyed. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=494.26s)]
*  Now we understand this morning that Pete Hegseth, our Secretary of Defense, is now looking for [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=497.05999999999995s)]
*  the source of that leak and that they will be looking to prosecute whoever has released [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=502.1s)]
*  that information against the will of the United States. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=507.98s)]
*  It was a violation of their job, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=510.86s)]
*  It was a violation of their security clearance. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=513.62s)]
*  But for right now, Jonathan, let's just try to zero in on what the Israelis are saying. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=516.9s)]
*  I understand that what they're not saying is that, you know, the way that Donald Trump [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=521.98s)]
*  put it, that the entire nuclear program in Iran was obliterated. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=525.9s)]
*  They're also not saying that it's a matter of months before the nuclear program gets [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=530.1s)]
*  online. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=534.82s)]
*  So it's somewhere in the middle, which is what I would expect to hear from the Israelis. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=535.82s)]
*  And I think, at least from what I've heard this morning from the folks that I've talked [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=539.74s)]
*  to, it's still not a clear picture. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=543.26s)]
*  It's still pretty fuzzy right now as they collect information about loose enriched uranium, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=546.7s)]
*  as they look for perhaps some of these secret sites that were not hit that maybe need to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=552.82s)]
*  be hit. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=557.26s)]
*  What is your general sense of what was achieved by the US strikes and the strikes before that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=558.38s)]
*  by the Israeli Air Force? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=564.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is not Osirak of 1981 and it's not Deir ez-Zor 2007 when BDA was, you know, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=566.22s)]
*  we were capable of doing that very quickly and it was pretty straightforward. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=575.18s)]
*  The bombs hit their targets, the targets were destroyed, and that was more or less the end [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=579.22s)]
*  of the story. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=583.22s)]
*  The Iranian nuclear weapons program was much more dispersed, it had much better defenses, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=584.22s)]
*  it was much more clandestine, and therefore the BDA will take longer. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=591.4200000000001s)]
*  And I said this yesterday in a TV interview, we just have to be patient and I agree with [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=596.3000000000001s)]
*  you 100%. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=601.4200000000001s)]
*  Anything coming out in the coming days and maybe even weeks is political for one purpose [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=603.46s)]
*  or the other. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=609.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think we'll just have to be, you know, contrary to what's fashionable these days, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=611.38s)]
*  we'll have to have patience, we will have to wait for real intel to be collected on [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=615.9399999999999s)]
*  the ground or based on other sources and there is an abundance of sources that Israel is [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=621.54s)]
*  tapping into and then, you know, create a more comprehensive understanding and assessment [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=626.02s)]
*  of what actually happened. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=631.6999999999999s)]
*  The assessments that I hear are from the IDF and they're talking about very good strikes [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=634.14s)]
*  on targets and that the initial BDA is overwhelmingly positive, which doesn't mean that everything [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=641.86s)]
*  was totally obliterated and it'll take the Iranians 15 years to go back to trying to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=649.62s)]
*  produce nuclear weapons. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=655.06s)]
*  But I think the cumulative effect of scientists, and that is the number one, I think, issue [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=657.02s)]
*  that so many in the Western media are not addressing and those people at the Defense [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=663.3000000000001s)]
*  Intelligence Agency, they didn't take that into account at all, but scientists with centuries [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  of knowledge and expertise in weaponization, super important that they no longer are around [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=676.9s)]
*  and all of the cumulative effect on equipment and facilities. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=682.62s)]
*  So I would say that the first assessment from the IDF is very positive, but Mossad [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=687.5s)]
*  people, I don't know if they're on the ground collecting information or not, but I would [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=694.86s)]
*  say that Mossad and IDF is very busy collecting intel and I think it's interesting to hear [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=700.54s)]
*  that the Iranians themselves an hour and a half ago issued a statement that their facilities [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=707.7s)]
*  were severely damaged by the American strike. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=714.14s)]
*  But the bottom line is what matters. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=717.54s)]
*  I think broad comprehensive damage was done to their program. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=719.2199999999999s)]
*  It's also, and that's my last word, how fast, how long will it take them to rebuild or do [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=725.2199999999999s)]
*  what they want? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=731.38s)]
*  That of course depends on how much resources they will spend on it and if they will do [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=733.16s)]
*  it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=737.3599999999999s)]
*  And of course, what we would need to try to force that to happen is that the Iranian regime [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=738.3599999999999s)]
*  will understand that it's not in its interest to do so and get into an agreement that has [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=743.7s)]
*  oversight and inspection and where the Iranians acknowledge and say we are not going to try [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=749.1400000000001s)]
*  to enrich on Iranian soil. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=754.82s)]
*  And then however successful the strike was or wasn't will be less relevant because that [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=757.82s)]
*  will be the path forward. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=763.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=765.26s)]
*  Another great summary. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=766.26s)]
*  I think the only thing that I would just add here is just the logic of what has just happened [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=767.5400000000001s)]
*  here. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=773.1s)]
*  There is the psychological deterrence now that I think the Iranian regime is not immune [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=774.1s)]
*  to. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=779.22s)]
*  They know that they're being watched. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=780.22s)]
*  They know that they have no air defense. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=781.5s)]
*  They know that the U.S. is capable and willing to attack if they cross a red line. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=782.9s)]
*  They know the Israelis are more than willing to do that as they did for more than a week [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=788.26s)]
*  and a half before the U.S. intervened. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=794.3s)]
*  On top of that, no conversion facilities. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=797.3s)]
*  On top of that, massive amounts of centrifuges are inaccessible or destroyed. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=799.68s)]
*  And look, I'm not a nuclear specialist. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  I will be the first to see that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=809.52s)]
*  But by logic alone, you begin to get the idea here that this is not something that the regime [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=812.62s)]
*  is going to be able to easily replace or that it will have the will to do so right now. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=819.92s)]
*  And I want to talk about the will in a minute. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=825.52s)]
*  Brad Bowman, I want to bring you in here because you've worked in the Pentagon. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=827.3s)]
*  You have done battle assessments. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=832.52s)]
*  You've looked at this stuff, you know, open source. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=834.96s)]
*  I know you guys are looking at it right now. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=837.72s)]
*  Some of the imagery that we have in this new center that we've stood up here at FTD, new [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=840.12s)]
*  program looking at satellite imagery. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  I want to get a sense from you about what you're seeing, both from the political level, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=849.1s)]
*  the leaks and the intent to try to influence the public debate, the public utterances from [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=854.76s)]
*  the White House, the official statements coming out of the Pentagon. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=860.28s)]
*  It's a lot of noise. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=864.0s)]
*  How do you kind of crystallize this in a way for FTD Morning Brief listeners and watchers [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=866.36s)]
*  to understand what's going on here? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=872.46s)]
*  What is the middle ground that we should be looking at? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=874.26s)]
*  John, thanks for the opportunity to join you and thanks for the great question. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=876.88s)]
*  It's wonderful to be here with my good friend, Jonathan, who has always just gave, I think, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=881.44s)]
*  a superb rundown and largely aligns with what I'm hearing and seeing and our independent [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=884.88s)]
*  analysis as well. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  Here's the bottom line up front, as we like to say in the U.S. military, battle damage [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=893.08s)]
*  assessments, BDA, the term that every American is learning, are ongoing. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=896.84s)]
*  But Israel's nuclear weapons program has been seriously degraded but not completely destroyed. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=907.32s)]
*  There it is. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=908.32s)]
*  But not completely destroyed. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=909.9200000000001s)]
*  And as someone who worked in the U.S. Senate for nine years and 15 years in the U.S. Army [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=911.36s)]
*  and had a top clearance for most of that time, big surprise that this is being weaponized. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=916.2800000000001s)]
*  Big surprise that everyone wants answers right now. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=923.08s)]
*  In our micro-ag culture, we want everything in 30 seconds. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=925.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, that's not how battle damage assessments work. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=928.44s)]
*  Students of military history, anyone who's been engaged in military intelligence operations [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=932.36s)]
*  understand that the first report is often wrong. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=936.0s)]
*  So it is neither true that this was a failure, it was not, and it is also not true that the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=939.72s)]
*  program was totally obliterated. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=944.32s)]
*  Sorry sports fans, the truth is in the middle, as it often is, that this was seriously degraded [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=946.6s)]
*  but not completely destroyed. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=951.48s)]
*  Battle damage assessment is continuing. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=953.8s)]
*  That's imagery intelligence, which everyone is familiar with, the satellite images, signals [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=956.04s)]
*  intelligence, human intelligence, looking to the Israelis for a lot of that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=960.12s)]
*  And here's one that maybe you haven't heard of, mass sense or measurement and signals [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=963.76s)]
*  intelligence where you're looking at acoustics and geophysicals. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=967.08s)]
*  There's all kinds of all sorts of intelligence being conducted. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=970.08s)]
*  The Defense Intelligence Agency put out leaked, I almost said put out leaked a report that [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=973.84s)]
*  was illegal and should be found out and punished. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=978.84s)]
*  That's inappropriate. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=981.76s)]
*  But let's put that in perspective. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=982.76s)]
*  That's one of about a dozen and a half of U.S. intelligence agencies. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=984.24s)]
*  The DIA is excellent. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=988.48s)]
*  There's a lot of patriotic Americans there. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=990.28s)]
*  They don't always get everything right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=992.48s)]
*  So take that with a grain of salt. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=994.24s)]
*  David Albright's report yesterday over at the good ISIS is aligned with what I'm saying. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=996.2s)]
*  Massive damage, they say, quote unquote, significantly set the program back, various levels of damage [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1001.72s)]
*  and destruction, but some unknowns, some unknowns, the status location of the enriched near weapons [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1007.04s)]
*  grade uranium, three to 5%, 20%, 60%. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1015.08s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1019.24s)]
*  How much it was destroyed? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1020.24s)]
*  And the centrifuges that were manufactured but not installed for Natanz and Forto, where [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1021.56s)]
*  are they and what is the degree of damage at Forto? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  So anyone who's saying they know exactly what the status is in Forto, I think doesn't unless [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1029.96s)]
*  they're deep into the intelligence community, don't know what they're talking about. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1034.92s)]
*  We had 14 massive ordinance penetrators drop. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1040.36s)]
*  That's the GVU 57th, 12 at Forto, two at Natanz. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1043.28s)]
*  They did serious, serious damage, but we're just going to have to be patient and see what [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1048.8400000000001s)]
*  happens and then I'd love to talk about the ceasefire, John, if you want to kind of ongoing [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1054.6000000000001s)]
*  sources of the long term conflict and how most of those remain undressed, but I'll take [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1058.92s)]
*  a breath there. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1062.48s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1063.48s)]
*  And that's exactly where I wanted to go next. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1064.48s)]
*  By the way, I'm just watching my screen right now. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1066.3200000000002s)]
*  Israelis are reporting the 218 education institutions took damage, right? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1068.88s)]
*  As we start to parse through exactly what's happened here to Israel, I think they've emerged [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1076.6s)]
*  victorious. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1082.28s)]
*  I think they've dominated the Iranians, but there was a price for this, which I think [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1083.28s)]
*  we always understood from the Israelis that there was going to be a price to pay for the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  operation that they were eventually going to carry out against the Iranians. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1091.8s)]
*  I understand, by the way, that from my friends in Israel, they're telling me that the damage [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  was far less than they had anticipated. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1098.9599999999998s)]
*  But let's talk about the damage to the regime and to the regime's proxies, right? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1102.0s)]
*  When we look around the region right now, Lebanon stayed quiet, Iraq stayed quiet, Syria [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1106.56s)]
*  stayed quiet. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1112.2s)]
*  Even the Houthis were pretty darn quiet throughout all of this. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1113.56s)]
*  So when you look at what's gone on here, I mean, it was pretty quiet out of Gaza, too. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1116.8799999999999s)]
*  A tough morning this morning from an Israeli perspective. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1120.9199999999998s)]
*  But overall, it felt like that seven front war kind of narrowed down to one front for [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1124.04s)]
*  the last 12 days. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1129.32s)]
*  And that, I think, has had a significant impact on that kind of wider scope of the war. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1131.08s)]
*  So if I can get you, Brad, to just talk to us for just a minute about, A, how much damage [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1136.56s)]
*  did the regime incur when we look at kind of what happened over those 12 days and the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1141.1399999999999s)]
*  Israelis just hammering hundreds and hundreds of targets, sorties day and night, going after [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1145.8s)]
*  key pillars of the regime? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1151.62s)]
*  And then let's broaden that out to take a look at what the rest of the region looks [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1153.72s)]
*  like. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1156.76s)]
*  Yeah, sounds good, John. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1157.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1158.76s)]
*  I'll try to be very quick. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1159.76s)]
*  I mean, what the Israelis did, you know, obviously in April last year and certainly even more [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1161.44s)]
*  so in October, and then what they've done over the week and a half or so was just incredibly [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1165.08s)]
*  impressive. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1170.02s)]
*  The near simultaneous taking out of scientists and top military leaders demonstrates a degree [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1171.02s)]
*  of penetration, intelligence capability and military prowess that is extraordinary. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1177.8s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely extraordinary. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, to hit one of those individuals is a feat. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1184.12s)]
*  To hit so many within such a short period of time, I would say, would not, if I were [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1188.24s)]
*  in the regime in Iran, which thankfully I'm not, would not leave me feeling very comfortable. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1192.48s)]
*  And so Jonathan's point earlier about how, you know, centuries of knowledge has been [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1196.68s)]
*  taken off the battlefield in terms of their nuclear weapons program. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1201.16s)]
*  I completely agree with that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1204.56s)]
*  The blow to the military, to the nuclear weapons sites, it is very, very significant. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1206.48s)]
*  This was absolutely a tactical operational success. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1214.8000000000002s)]
*  Whether it is a strategic or grand strategic success, I think will be determined by what [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1218.4s)]
*  comes next at the negotiating table where we know the regime is particularly capable [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1222.26s)]
*  and there's a tendency on the American side to adopt bad deals. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1226.6200000000001s)]
*  In terms of the axis, the so-called axis of resistance, honestly, when I was looking at [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1230.3600000000001s)]
*  possible retaliations, the number one thing I was looking at was the Iraqi militias. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1235.5600000000002s)]
*  I suspected that we'd have less or nothing in Syria because of what's happened there [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1239.96s)]
*  with Assad and the new regime and the serious blow to the Iranian presence and prowess in Syria. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1243.88s)]
*  I was most concerned about Iraqi militias targeting American bases there. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1249.64s)]
*  That's the dog thus far that didn't bark or bite, if you will. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1255.0400000000002s)]
*  And we saw after October 7th, and we did this big tracker, me and Cameron McMillan at FTD, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1260.7600000000002s)]
*  where we documented over 180 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria by Iranian proxies, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1265.5200000000002s)]
*  with sadly a very few American retaliation. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1272.0s)]
*  And we saw that turn on or off, demonstrating more or less the command and control of Tehran. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1274.72s)]
*  So that what appears to happen, Tehran did not say, hey, Axis, hey, what's left of Hezbollah, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1280.92s)]
*  hey, Houthis, hey, Iraqi militias, it's go time, it's go time. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1286.8s)]
*  They didn't do that. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1290.92s)]
*  Why did they not do that? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1291.92s)]
*  It's conjecture, it's informed conjecture. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1293.12s)]
*  I would say it's because they understand that the Israelis can strike any target on the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1294.64s)]
*  surface in Iran at will, with precision, and so can the Americans. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1299.8799999999999s)]
*  And so if you're in that position, right, they had to respond, they had to respond, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1304.12s)]
*  but you're careful about the response because you know that you're doing so if it's too [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1308.24s)]
*  much or you have American casualties, per what Donald Trump said, we were going to come [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1312.52s)]
*  back and rock their world. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1316.78s)]
*  So they're in a new place here in terms of understanding their own vulnerability, but [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1318.12s)]
*  I am not holding my breath that the fundamental sources, the conflict, the four sources that [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1322.9199999999998s)]
*  highlighted in X-post yesterday, all of those remain in effect to some degree remain unaddressed. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1327.12s)]
*  And I'll just end with this. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1332.36s)]
*  Not all ceasefires are good. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1333.36s)]
*  OK, I'm so glad that the ballistic missiles for now are not going to Israel against our [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1335.32s)]
*  best ally in the Middle East. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1341.72s)]
*  But I remain concerned that the main sources of this conflict, all of which reside with [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1343.2s)]
*  the regime in Iran, remain fundamentally unaddressed. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1348.08s)]
*  Yeah. So let's talk about those. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1350.56s)]
*  We've got the nuclear program itself still unresolved. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1353.04s)]
*  You got the missiles still unresolved. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1356.72s)]
*  You got the proxies still unresolved. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1359.2s)]
*  And then you've got the regime itself. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1361.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the sort of ultimate driver, the ideological engine of all of this still intact. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1363.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. So these are the core issues that we're dealing with right now. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1368.8400000000001s)]
*  So, Jonathan, let me turn to you first for the Israeli perspective on this. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1372.3600000000001s)]
*  What do the Israelis want to see out of whatever? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1376.52s)]
*  I don't know if it's Doha or Muscat or some other traitorous ally of ours in the Middle [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1378.88s)]
*  East. They're going to host these conversations. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1383.4s)]
*  These people, by the way, should not be hosting these talks. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1386.2s)]
*  They are not disinterested parties. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1389.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, that looks like where we're going to go. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1392.08s)]
*  What are you looking for? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1395.08s)]
*  What should the Israelis be trying to get out of these talks? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  And do you think that any of that is feasible? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1400.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I very much agree with what what Bradley is saying, as always, words of wisdom [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1403.84s)]
*  based grounded on facts and not conjecture, which is very refreshing these days when we [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1410.64s)]
*  hear so much information of people who don't know what they're talking about. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1416.36s)]
*  But I would say this, I think this is a great opening act by Israel in a watershed [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1420.8s)]
*  moment in Middle Eastern history where for the first time at a strategic, significant [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1427.56s)]
*  level, Israel for at least 12 days took its position behind the driving wheel and was [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1433.04s)]
*  actually dictating events and by its military excellence, I dare say, really reshaped and [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1442.72s)]
*  redrew the battle lines in the Middle East. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1450.56s)]
*  And if Israel is smart and if Israel will be able to continue to coordinate its operations [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1453.8799999999999s)]
*  and actions with the US at the same level or close to the same level that we saw the [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1461.68s)]
*  Israel and US coordinate events before June 13, then I'm hopeful about the future. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1467.4s)]
*  But as Bradley said very correctly, the Iranian regime has a long and pretty successful [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1473.8s)]
*  track record of using diplomacy and negotiations as a tool to further their political [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1479.68s)]
*  and military and strategic aims. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1487.0s)]
*  And Israel does not, I'm afraid to say. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1488.8400000000001s)]
*  We are many times good on the battlefield, but many times we don't translate our tactical [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1491.68s)]
*  and operational achievements into long lasting agreements. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1499.1200000000001s)]
*  The exception would be perhaps looking at the current situation in Lebanon. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1502.76s)]
*  There's a ceasefire. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1507.52s)]
*  Israel is enforcing the implementation of the ceasefire very strictly and aggressively. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1508.76s)]
*  And Hezbollah is forced to comply. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1514.88s)]
*  And good things are happening with the Lebanese state in internal dynamics in that country. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1517.84s)]
*  And I think that, by the way, that was main or an important part of the reason why Hezbollah [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1523.2s)]
*  decided not to get into the battle. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1527.64s)]
*  But what I think Israelis are looking at now, you know, there's a long there's still an [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1530.08s)]
*  ongoing debate in Israel about the regime, whether or not Israel should have a clear and [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1534.52s)]
*  outspoken goal to weaken that regime and to eventually try to create the conditions [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1540.08s)]
*  or help bringing about the conditions for that regime to fall. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1547.12s)]
*  So there's a debate about that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1550.96s)]
*  All of the things that you said about missiles, about funding and arming terrorist [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1552.56s)]
*  organizations and about the overarching, the paramount ambition of the Iranian regime, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1557.6399999999999s)]
*  which is to annihilate the state of Israel, they have not changed. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1563.1999999999998s)]
*  And this is just the opening, very exciting and important, but this is the opening act [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1566.52s)]
*  of what I think is a longer and bigger story, which I hope will end. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  I personally hope that it will end with the fall of the Iranian regime and with good, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1577.28s)]
*  positive things happening in the future for Iranians and for the Middle East. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1582.1200000000001s)]
*  So at this time, we're back to political debates in Israel. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1587.16s)]
*  And I think more or less there's consensus that this was well done, well decided by the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1592.24s)]
*  government, well executed by the defense establishment. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1599.44s)]
*  And now we have to continue. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1602.96s)]
*  There is worry. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1604.92s)]
*  And I very much agree with what you say, Jonathan, the interlocutors here and the fact [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1606.28s)]
*  that Qatar, that nefarious state supporter and of terrorism has so much credibility and [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1611.72s)]
*  so much influence in what's happening is not a good thing. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1619.52s)]
*  And the fact that President Trump seems so positive towards that country and continues [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1623.24s)]
*  to praise its efforts, etc., is not a good thing because they are not a benign actor. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  They are negative. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1633.96s)]
*  They promote terrorism. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1635.4s)]
*  They incite violence and they are definitely aligned with some of the more negative forces [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1636.6s)]
*  in the Middle East, whether it's the Muslim Brotherhood on one end or politically aligned [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1642.84s)]
*  with the Iranian regime on the other, even though the two are sometimes opposed in other [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1647.76s)]
*  parts. So to summarize, I would say it's a mix of hopefulness and happiness with the [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1652.64s)]
*  achievement, but some dread about where the diplomatic, diplomatic deliberations are going [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1658.36s)]
*  to take us eventually. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1664.52s)]
*  Yeah, a great summary again. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1666.24s)]
*  You know, I think when we look at possible outcomes here, I think, you know, you have the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1669.16s)]
*  possibility of just a surrender. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1673.24s)]
*  Right. But I think that is a low possibility given the nature of this regime. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1676.84s)]
*  I don't think they're going to want to see defeat to the United States or Israel. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1680.6799999999998s)]
*  That is not the nature of this regime. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1684.72s)]
*  And I wouldn't expect it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1686.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, I think that from there, you know, we people are talking about the possibility [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1688.72s)]
*  of, you know, the people rising up, the crown prince of Iran calling from Paris for the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1693.8799999999999s)]
*  Iranian people to do that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1699.8s)]
*  Haven't seen it happen yet. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1701.48s)]
*  There is the possibility of some kind of internal coup, right. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1703.1999999999998s)]
*  Some kind of IRGC internal officers rebellion when they look at the collapse of the [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1705.76s)]
*  Ayatollah's regime and their inability to defend against Israel in the United States. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1711.76s)]
*  I've got to imagine that there are some people that are pretty frustrated there. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1715.64s)]
*  But I do think that we may actually be steering into this weird place right now where [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1719.32s)]
*  the regime stays in power. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1725.36s)]
*  They are unstable and that the threats, many of these threats still remain, but that [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1728.24s)]
*  Israel and the United States remain vigilant and it would look very similar to what's been [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1734.52s)]
*  happening in places like Lebanon or Syria. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1738.8s)]
*  Of course, the difference being is that with Lebanon and Syria, they're right on Israel's [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1741.84s)]
*  border. And so for Israel to be able to strike at something that makes them nervous or that [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1745.04s)]
*  they see as a threat, it's easy to scramble a jet, you know, an F-35 or a squadron of [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1749.24s)]
*  them and to have them fly clear across the Middle East and then to attack Iran only to [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1755.68s)]
*  then see the Iranians firing ballistic missiles in response at Israel. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1760.3999999999999s)]
*  This is the kind of scenario that I think we're all worried about, that we could fall into [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1764.84s)]
*  this thing where the conflict re-erupts on occasion as Israel takes care of problems [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1769.24s)]
*  that it sees developing as the regime perhaps tries to reconstitute any one of its military [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1775.6799999999998s)]
*  or nuclear or other programs. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1780.9599999999998s)]
*  And so this is, I think, the scenario that I'd like to see avoided. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1782.8799999999999s)]
*  But Brad, final question to you before we wrap up. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1786.2s)]
*  From the U.S. perspective right now, the sort of diplomatic dance that I think we're about [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1789.72s)]
*  to start here, what are you looking for? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1794.72s)]
*  I mean, we talk about Donald Trump as the dealmaker, right? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1797.72s)]
*  But we also know that the negotiations that we've seen thus far have been hit and [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1801.0s)]
*  miss. Let's just put it that way, right? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1806.8000000000002s)]
*  We didn't really achieve much. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1809.52s)]
*  The fact that the Israelis launched on day 61 after Trump gave them 60 days was actually [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1811.2s)]
*  an indication that the negotiation channel was not successful. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1817.1200000000001s)]
*  So what are we looking for now as we go back into negotiation mode? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1821.64s)]
*  Is there anything that can be achieved with this regime? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1826.76s)]
*  Thanks. Thanks, John. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1829.8s)]
*  Let me start by saying that I once again, I respect Jonathan's admirable kind of self [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1830.88s)]
*  reflection on the challenges that Israel has had at the negotiating table. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1838.32s)]
*  And I would take that. That's what true professionals like Jonathan do. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1841.6s)]
*  And I would do the same thing for the United States. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1845.08s)]
*  I would apply basically everything he says to the United States. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1847.32s)]
*  And I'm borrowing a bit here from Lieutenant General retired H.R. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1850.56s)]
*  McMaster, chair of our center. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1853.84s)]
*  The United States since 9-11 has struggled severely, struggled, is a nice word, to [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1855.76s)]
*  convert battlefield success to sustainable political outcomes that serve the national [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1860.9199999999998s)]
*  interests. That has been a major weak point for us. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1865.92s)]
*  And we are in danger of doing that again if we don't watch a few things. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1869.1200000000001s)]
*  Let me run through them quickly. We've got to be wary of Iranian diplomacy and agreements [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1872.64s)]
*  that do not address the fundamental sources of conflict that we keep referring to, that [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1877.28s)]
*  provide Iran, as Mark Dewitz has said, a patient pathway to a nuclear weapon and repeat [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1881.48s)]
*  the mistakes of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Agreement. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1886.2s)]
*  Number one, we've got to watch that like a hawk. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1888.68s)]
*  We should not make preemptive concessions to Iran to start negotiations, oh, I don't [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1891.32s)]
*  know, like supporting Iranian oil exports to China. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1897.0s)]
*  And we know how Iran will use those revenues to oppress the Iranian people. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1900.28s)]
*  Ballistic missile program, nuclear program, terrorism attacks on us, Arab partners in [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1903.9199999999998s)]
*  Israel. We should watch Iran's actions very closely at Pickaxe Mountain, for example, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1907.8s)]
*  this other site that was not hit and several other sites and what they do at Fordow and [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1913.4799999999998s)]
*  some of the other things. We've got to monitor closely what China [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1917.7199999999998s)]
*  and Russia are doing to help Iran. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1921.0s)]
*  I hope everyone saw the meeting of the Iranian Foreign Minister, where Putin, where he [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1923.32s)]
*  expressed that support for Iran, that support can take multiple forms, intelligence, even [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1926.64s)]
*  weapons, advanced aircraft, air defenses. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1932.64s)]
*  Watch that closely. Watch the ammonium chlorate shipments from China. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1934.92s)]
*  It's going to help Iran rebuild its ballistic missile program. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1939.36s)]
*  We've got to bolster U.S. military lethality. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1943.0s)]
*  This strike that we did was incredibly impressive, but I thought for years it would take [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1945.04s)]
*  not one impressive strike, but multiple over days or weeks to be effective. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1949.44s)]
*  So big surprise that we didn't destroy the program with one, albeit impressive, strike. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1953.64s)]
*  And we got to bolster our regional force protection because we could have worse days [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1958.04s)]
*  ahead when Iran rebuilds. Almost done here. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1961.3200000000002s)]
*  We got to act to replenish Israel's air launched precision guided munitions. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1963.8s)]
*  They expended a ton. They're building some of their own. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  America has got to help Israel rebuild its air launched precision strike munitions and [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1972.04s)]
*  its air defenses, both replenishing the aero interceptors and helping to increase their [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1977.28s)]
*  air defense capacity. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1981.8s)]
*  They can do a lot of that on their own, but not all of it on their own. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1983.32s)]
*  They need our help. And then finally, because I believe what a good deal requires and into [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1986.16s)]
*  their Iran's nuclear weapons program and no enrichment in addressing their strategic [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1991.52s)]
*  ballistic missile arsenal, this regime, I'm sorry, will never agree to that. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=1996.16s)]
*  They will not agree to what we need for American and Israeli interests. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2000.64s)]
*  So that's why I believe Mark Dewitts is exactly right that we need a comprehensive [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2004.16s)]
*  maximum support campaign for the Iranian people so that they can finally have a government [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2008.8s)]
*  that's focused on the welfare of the Iranian people rather than exporting terrorism. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2013.24s)]
*  So those are the seven things I've watched going forward. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2017.0s)]
*  Wow. Seven things. All right. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2018.96s)]
*  Just just a handful. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2020.8s)]
*  All right. I did that. Didn't I try? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2021.96s)]
*  That's right. Well, I think you guys have provided really just indispensable analysis [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2023.92s)]
*  here for us as we try to make sense of everything that's gone on over the last 24 hours. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2029.28s)]
*  The obviously the news cycle has been dizzying. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2034.2s)]
*  The conflicting reports continue. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2037.56s)]
*  And it's a battle of narratives. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2040.32s)]
*  And of course, those narratives don't actually matter at the end of the day. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2042.64s)]
*  What matters is the truth. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2045.88s)]
*  And we are still trying to get to the truth of what happened. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2047.44s)]
*  We're trying to get an accurate BDA, an accurate battle damage assessment. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2050.72s)]
*  We're still working on that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2055.56s)]
*  That's going to be the result of of the Israeli channels, the US channels, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2056.92s)]
*  perhaps other intelligence services also weighing in those that are concerned [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2061.8s)]
*  about the nuclear program. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2065.92s)]
*  We're heading down the path of diplomacy now. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2067.2400000000002s)]
*  This is going to be a very different kind [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2070.32s)]
*  of diplomatic path because we now see leverage on the part of Israel, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2072.6400000000003s)]
*  leverage on the part of the United States. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2077.08s)]
*  But as I think you both have indicated today, you need to use that leverage. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2078.8s)]
*  You cannot cede the initiative back to the Iranian regime. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2082.88s)]
*  They will try to take advantage of all of this. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2087.6000000000004s)]
*  We need to make sure that they don't. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2090.1600000000003s)]
*  We're going to keep watching all of it here. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2092.2000000000003s)]
*  We're going to keep tracking what's going [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2094.48s)]
*  on in Israel as they assess the damage from those one thousand drones, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2096.2000000000003s)]
*  from those five hundred plus ballistic missiles, from the damage that was [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2100.2400000000002s)]
*  incurred as the people defiantly come out of their shelters, shrug off 12 days of war [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2104.48s)]
*  and get back to the business of trying to keep their country safe, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2110.84s)]
*  fighting to get back to hostages in Gaza, trying to make sure that what we just saw [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2115.2400000000002s)]
*  transpire doesn't happen again for years and years to come. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2120.48s)]
*  Lots of challenges ahead. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2124.6000000000004s)]
*  Want to thank you both for joining us, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2126.5200000000004s)]
*  Jonathan Konrigas, Bradley Bowman, thank you for joining us today. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2128.28s)]
*  We're going to have Jacob Nagle with us on Friday. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2131.8s)]
*  Jacob is a former national security advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXigZadSxUU&t=2135.0s)]
