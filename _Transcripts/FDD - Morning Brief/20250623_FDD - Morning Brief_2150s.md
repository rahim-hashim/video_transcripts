# Damage Assessment: U.S. Strikes on Iran's Nuclear Sites (Jun. 23)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U)
*  Another intense night of news waking up this morning to find out that the Israelis are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=0.0s)]
*  striking Basij, they're striking IRGC, they have struck the notorious Evin prison, they have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=24.32s)]
*  struck Palestine Square where a clock has been counting down to the destruction, the purported [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=31.2s)]
*  destruction of the state of Israel. We're hearing that the Israelis have also taken out the roads [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=37.52s)]
*  leading to and from the Fordo nuclear facility trying to make sure that nobody can get in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=43.04s)]
*  or out trying to make sure that whatever nuclear materials are entombed there that they stay there [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  until perhaps Israeli special forces can arrive. A massive amount of news and I can't wait to dig [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  in. Jonathan Schanzer here, executive director, Foundation for Defensive Democracies. Welcome [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  back to this special edition of the FTD Morning Brief. We're calling this a sit rep and I've got [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=67.6s)]
*  three unbelievable experts from FTD to help break it down for us today. We've got Mark Montgomery, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=73.36s)]
*  head of our Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, former or retired rather Admiral [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=80.48s)]
*  in the Navy. We've got Brad Bowman, the director of our, senior director of our Center on Military [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=85.84s)]
*  and Political Power, former lecturer at West Point, helicopter pilot and all things amazing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=92.64s)]
*  on all things military. And we also have with us Behnam Ben Talaveru, the notorious BBT. He is the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=100.56s)]
*  senior director of our Iran program and he is coming to us today to talk about some of the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=107.44s)]
*  missiles that are still in the Iranian arsenal but also to help us break down what's happening [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=114.4s)]
*  inside of Iran. This is a place that has thrived on paranoia and you've got to imagine that's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=119.44s)]
*  coming back to bite the regime. So we're going to talk about all of these things today. We're [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=126.72s)]
*  going to do it in about a half hour the way we usually do but I'm not doing headlines today. I'm [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  not doing monologues. I'm not doing any of that. I want these guys to help break it down. So I want [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=136.24s)]
*  to start with Mark Montgomery. Mark, we've been talking a lot about battle damage assessment, BDA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=142.0s)]
*  We had Secretary of Defense Pete Hegsef come on TV yesterday with his generals talking about what [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  may or may not have been hit inside Iran. I would say that right now it still feels like we're not [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=158.88s)]
*  getting total clarity on exactly what happened at those three sites that have been destroyed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=163.84s)]
*  How do you assess what's going on here right now? Do you believe today that those attacks were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=169.44s)]
*  entirely successful or are there doubts that are creeping in to the BDA? Well, John, thanks for [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=175.12s)]
*  having me. First, I'd say I have never used the term obliterate when I refer to battle [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  damage assessment nor has any other military officer I know. So please take that word and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  set it aside. So how did it go? Well, first I want to say this was an impressive strike. It's one that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=193.36s)]
*  has been rehearsed since I was a captain in the Navy. So 2007 or 2008 was the first time I would [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=200.32s)]
*  see this type of thinking. The MOP was developed in tandem with the rehearsal on this, the massive [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=205.68s)]
*  ordnance penetrator, the 30,000-pound GBU-57 weapon, which FDD Brad's center has a beautiful [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=210.96s)]
*  image of an explanatory video on our website. So please take a look. So we've been practicing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=220.48s)]
*  this and what it is is it is a very complex operation, but it's really broken down. The way [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=228.16s)]
*  the military does things, a complex operation, we break it down into like 100 routine parts, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=235.04s)]
*  taking off, refueling en route, European refuelers coming up and hitting them, and then passing over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  the target, dropping the weapon. The only part of this that we're doing is we're trying to get [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=244.48s)]
*  the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=248.24s)]
*  the massive ordnance penetrators. That was unique. Everything else is something we've done. And boy, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=252.82000000000002s)]
*  even that being unique, the pilots have practiced it probably a hundred times each. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=259.2s)]
*  So that's how the U.S. military works. We take extremely complex issues, break them down, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=263.44s)]
*  and then re-aggregate them together from these routine things into a comprehensive event. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=268.24s)]
*  So how did it go? We dropped 12 mops on Fordow. It's close to what I would have expected, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=273.52s)]
*  probably slightly higher, but Fordow is expanding, so who knows? You can see on the aim points, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=279.2s)]
*  they hit where expected. There's six aim points for 12 weapons. That's right. As you can see in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=285.68s)]
*  the video we have on FDD in the graphic, that's how we plan it. One missile burrows a channel, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=291.12s)]
*  one bomb burrows a channel with its 25,000 pounds of special metal that drills itself down in, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=300.64s)]
*  then explodes deep, and then the second one comes in behind and does even more work, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  and you get deeper and deeper. So that's how I expected it. I can definitely see geological [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=311.76s)]
*  alterations in the terrain there, which is what I would expect. Now, when I was an admiral, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  I would expect an initial BDA at 24 hours, so that should be happening right now, and I would expect [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  a comprehensive BDA in 72 to 96 hours, and it's based on types of intelligence, signals intelligence, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=329.92s)]
*  listening to the chatter of people going, holy crap, this just happened, right? We and the Israelis [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  are both doing that. Imagery intelligence, you're starting to see that. Maxar, because they sell [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  their stuff civilian, you're probably seeing stuff that's almost as good, just not at the same [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  number of degrees, and we have Lydia LeFavor in our CMPP who I know is looking at it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=352.8s)]
*  So we'll get a reasonable analysis of that, but that's not enough. You also have to have mass [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=357.76s)]
*  sent. We almost never talk about that. That's measurements intelligence. So we were listening for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=362.48s)]
*  seismic events at the moment this happened. Did we hear the roofs collapsing? That, to me, would be [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=368.0s)]
*  the gold standard. If they came back and said there was a 3.7 magnitude seismic magnitude event, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=373.84s)]
*  our mass had detected, I'd say, okay, that's what I expected. That means it collapsed. Then the fourth [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=381.44s)]
*  one's humit, and that's more the IDF, not the IDF, the Israeli Security Services, you bring those [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=386.48s)]
*  all together and you get a great assessment. So that photo, I would wait till I hear that. My [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=391.92s)]
*  initial inclination on the stuff you can see commercially at this point is it looks like it [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=398.56s)]
*  should have worked, but we'll wait to see that. Natanz was two mops, much easier. That was just [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=405.44s)]
*  a collapse of, I think, the underground large centrifuge block, and I imagine we just collapsed [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=412.32s)]
*  the roof. It's already had a vacuum event in it from Israeli bombs. We just probably collapsed [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=421.68s)]
*  the roof on top of it and made sure everything's broken in there. Probably coordinated that with [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=427.36s)]
*  the Israelis. The Esfahan one's weirder because, to me, we've launched 24, maybe 30 tomahawks from [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=431.44s)]
*  either the Georgia or Florida. One of our SSGNs, a converted Ohio-class ballistic missile, carries [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=439.28s)]
*  more than 100 tomahawks. That's a weird strike to me. Tomahawk is worth a couple JDAMs, which are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=445.03999999999996s)]
*  something the Israelis could drop on that all the time and have. I think the Israelis saved some [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=452.32s)]
*  targets there for us, or just in their prioritization, they weren't there yet. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  I don't think the tomahawk brought a unique aspect to that. I just think President Trump wanted to hit [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=461.28s)]
*  three things. The joint staff is weird. They don't want to do stuff joint over one service, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=467.28s)]
*  so they probably made that. I swear to God, I do not think that was something we had to do. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=475.2s)]
*  The Israelis could have done it. I'm glad we did it. We were going to pay one way or the other. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  I think we provide a lot of JDAMs to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, by our own tomahawks. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  It might have been expiring, who knows, but we use those on that strike. I'm happy with that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=491.44s)]
*  From my perspective, that's good. That's a great summary. Let me ask you about the warnings that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=496.48s)]
*  we're seeing right now, that there are bases that are potentially going to be targeted [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=505.36s)]
*  by the Iranians. That's the threat at any rate, and the U.S. appears to be responding to it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  There are reports coming out of Qatar today that Americans are being asked to shelter in place. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=515.44s)]
*  I do want to note the irony here of one Hamas patron threatening another. It's a weird thing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=521.04s)]
*  here, but then again, Qatar, we've talked about it on this program, ad nauseam. It's a weird place. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=529.12s)]
*  Not where I'd want to have a base right now, but that's, I guess, what we're dealing with. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=535.12s)]
*  You've been through this, Mark. You've dealt with these sorts of threats in the past against [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=539.76s)]
*  American service members. What's going on here, and how should we be interpreting this? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=543.92s)]
*  I do want to say I agree with you on Qatar, awful little transactional country. I will remind [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=551.52s)]
*  people I was part of the negotiating team in the way back machine. The Saudis had all opportunity [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  in the world to have that base on Saudi territory. They chose not to in the end, and Bahrain's full [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  with the U.S. Navy. We ended up in Qatar. That's bad. What are the threats? The threats are we have [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=566.24s)]
*  45,000 or so, give or take a little bit, U.S. forces in the theater. The good news is the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  president ordered kind of an op-sec bust on the Israelis about a day before the Israeli [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=577.04s)]
*  strike started. He ordered an ordered departure of U.S. dependence from Bahrain. I think they're all [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=582.16s)]
*  out now. We use some of that two-week, that deceptive two-week notice, the three or four [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  days we had, to push weapons in. Air defense weapons are coming in both to the regional [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=594.16s)]
*  countries, to the U.S. forces in Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, our patriot and THAAD systems, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=600.56s)]
*  but also more ships off of Israel to help with Israel and THAADs into Israel to help with the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=608.0s)]
*  U.S. THAAD battery there. We've been pushing stuff in. The threat that the half of our forces are [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  out at sea are fine, they're protected by Aegis destroyers, but the half that are ashore, and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  Aegis destroyers inherently have the right level of defense all the time because you can't bring [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  stuff out to a ship. The half that are ashore, we've had to surge capability capacity, and after [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=627.04s)]
*  we killed Soleimani appropriately in January of 2020, the strike was back against U.S. forces, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  and we downplayed the impact of that. First of all, we got lucky as hell that a lot of their stuff [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=637.52s)]
*  just missed, but we still had 30-plus Purple Hearts, so that tells you from traumatic brain [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=642.64s)]
*  injury, from traumatic brain injury type injuries. People can get hurt during these [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=649.76s)]
*  counterstrikes, even if they're bunkered, but we've bunkered the rest of those forces, consolidated [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=659.68s)]
*  them. We have as much air defense as we could surge into them. We're weak on that capacity. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=663.92s)]
*  That's why Brad and I created a missile defense center to kind of argue for the kind of capacities [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=668.4s)]
*  we needed. That kind of strike is going to have an impact, so I worry about it, and probably the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=672.24s)]
*  ones who worry the most are IRGC proxy forces in Iraq striking at the U.S. The 2,500 U.S. forces [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=677.6s)]
*  in Iraq are the 1,000 U.S. forces in Syria. I think politically that's easier for Iran than [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=684.72s)]
*  striking into the Gulf Cooperation Council states and getting them solidly on their side. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=691.36s)]
*  I talk about mining the Straits of Hormuz in a different question, but I'll say of the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=696.5600000000001s)]
*  things, options open to them that can get at the U.S., this is probably number one. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=700.64s)]
*  It also invite the U.S. to return visit to Iran with a lot of weapons systems, so I don't think [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=706.56s)]
*  it would be a smart move by the Iranians, but it is going to open to them. Not at all, and I got to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=713.04s)]
*  say, to me it seems suicidal, but this could be a wounded animal here that we're looking at, cornered [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=718.64s)]
*  regime that maybe feels like it doesn't have much choice in the matter. Surrender looks like the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  smart move for me, but then again, and I want to talk about this with Fahmoud shortly, but I just [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=729.1199999999999s)]
*  don't know if you can be the Islamic Republic of Iran, call for death to America, call for death [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=734.96s)]
*  to Israel, and still surrender, so that's why we may be looking at these attacks. But all right, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=739.12s)]
*  Brad, I want to turn to you, and I want to ask you about what the Israeli military strategy looks [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  like. You've been watching these bombs drop, you've been watching the F-35s, they're working [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  around the clock right now targeting different assets across the regime. I know they're hunting [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=756.24s)]
*  for missiles, I know they're hunting for launchers, I know they're trying to target different aspects [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=761.6s)]
*  of the, let's say, the apparatus of repression in the regime. It looks like they're going after [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=768.32s)]
*  key pillars of the regime too, but how would you describe what's going on with the Israelis? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  John, it's great to join you and my two great colleagues. Great analysis as always by [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=780.0s)]
*  Admiral Montgomery. I would agree that over the coming days, very quickly, that using imagery [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  intelligence, signals intelligence, human intelligence, and measurement intelligence, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=789.12s)]
*  we're going to learn a lot more about how effective these U.S. strikes were. I'm really watching three [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=794.16s)]
*  things there in terms of how the damage regarding Fordow, that's a leading thing to watch, obviously, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=798.4s)]
*  because that's where the U.S. role is decisive. Also looking at the nuclear weapons grade, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=803.6s)]
*  uranium, where that is, whether that was destroyed, whether that's been secreted off somewhere else, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=810.4s)]
*  Netanyahu suggested that maybe Israel has some intelligence on that. And then this pickaxe [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=816.08s)]
*  mountain near Natanz, where they're digging deeper and deeper and deeper, and whether they're going [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=820.24s)]
*  to try to do more there in the future to prevent what's happened at Fordow. In terms of the Israeli [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=823.92s)]
*  strike strikes and campaign, broader campaign, building on what they did in April last year, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=829.6800000000001s)]
*  where they demonstrated they could precisely hit that radar. And then October, an incredibly [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=834.48s)]
*  impressive campaign where they focused on ballistic missile production capacity and launchers and parts [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  of their nuclear program. What we've seen from the Israelis has been incredibly impressive and [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=845.04s)]
*  really, frankly, has worked hand in glove, if you will, with what the United States ended up doing. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=850.48s)]
*  I mean, you can think of it as Israelis jabbing and then America came in with a roundhouse kick [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  to the head. It was not a mortal blow that we delivered, and we're going to have to wait and see [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=859.92s)]
*  how extensive the damage was. But since then, exactly right, I think the Israelis have been [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=864.56s)]
*  falling up in the way you would expect them to. Strikes on the IRGC, some subsequent attacks on [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=869.6s)]
*  some of the nuclear sites, and then expanding attack. And of course, they hit the nuclear [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=875.36s)]
*  scientists and IRGC leaders. An incredibly impressive, not only intelligence effort, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=880.16s)]
*  military campaign. To hit that many intelligence and military leaders within such a short period [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=884.8s)]
*  of time demonstrates how infiltrated the Iranian regime is by Mossad and the military's ability to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=889.76s)]
*  follow up on that and take them out. We're seeing the strikes on Evin Prison and really things [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=896.16s)]
*  focusing on the stability of the regime, hoping that the Iranian people finally have a regime [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=900.9599999999999s)]
*  that's more interested in their welfare rather than the export of terrorism. I think that the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  challenge for Israel in the coming days will be how they can continue to hit these strikes, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=910.48s)]
*  conduct these strikes in urban areas while minimizing civilian casualties. If you want [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  the Iranian people to correctly view the regime as the villain and not Israel, you really got to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=921.28s)]
*  minimize those civilian casualties. I think that's going to be key. You don't hit the people you want [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=926.72s)]
*  to be your ally. That's easier said than done because of course this regime is putting a lot [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=932.48s)]
*  of their key capabilities in and around civilians. We've seen that playbook in Gaza, for example. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=937.36s)]
*  But in short, incredibly impressive. My study of history tells me that military campaigns are [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=942.8s)]
*  usually longer and more painful than expected. I'm really watching to see how Iran responds. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=948.08s)]
*  They've got a real dilemma here. They're going to continue to launch ballistic missiles to the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  degree that they have them and launchers at Israel. We've got to help Israel as we continue with our [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=957.44s)]
*  naval assets in the eastern Mediterranean and defeat those attacks as well as the FAB batteries [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=962.0s)]
*  in Israel. But Israel basically can hit anything it wants in Iran right now. The United States can [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=966.88s)]
*  as well. I think both countries, certainly Israel, should use that to our maximum advantage. But the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=973.28s)]
*  big unknown, the big thing to watch is how they're going to retaliate against the U.S. They need to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=978.8s)]
*  do so for face-saving reasons, but they understand if they do too much, then that will give Trump [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=985.04s)]
*  license to do what he may want to do. That is an even worse day for them following those strikes. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=990.64s)]
*  Yeah, and I will just say that when we look at this total dominance in the air, I mean, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  air superiority doesn't even begin to cover it, right? Superiority and then some. It's superiority [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1003.7600000000001s)]
*  on steroids. I mean, you cannot, I mean, the Israelis control Iran's airspace right now. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1009.6s)]
*  There is no, there's no air force. There's no, I mean, there's no air defense. I mean, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1015.2800000000001s)]
*  it's remarkable what the Israelis have done. Certainly the U.S. has done this in places like [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1019.5200000000001s)]
*  Iraq or Afghanistan in years past, but wow, to see the Israelis do this, a tiny, tiny country, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1023.84s)]
*  the size of New Jersey, controlling a country that is twice the size of Texas and not, I mean, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1030.56s)]
*  nothing's coming in or out. It's remarkable. But let me ask you to just broaden this out for a [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1037.44s)]
*  minute. We talk a lot here at FTD about the axis of aggressors, right? We talk about China, Russia, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1043.44s)]
*  Iran. Maybe you want to throw North Korea in there. Some people use the term crink [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1050.24s)]
*  to talk about this axis. They are been pretty quiet, right? I mean, you have like, I guess, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1054.72s)]
*  you know, some of these countries, I mean, I haven't heard anything out of North Korea. I'm [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1062.72s)]
*  curious if you guys have the Russians. I understand they're saying, hey, you know, war's not the [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1065.6s)]
*  answer, which is pretty rich coming from Vladimir Putin's regime. And then you've got, you know, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1069.84s)]
*  and by the way, he's also talked about how he doesn't want to attack Israel because there's [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1075.36s)]
*  two million Russians or a million and a half Russians there or people of Russian origin who [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1078.48s)]
*  are now living in Israel. He sees Israel as sort of a, I don't know, a satellite country of sorts [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1083.68s)]
*  to Russia. The Chinese, I, you know, I'm not seeing a whole lot. They're not, they're not really [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1088.16s)]
*  protesting a whole lot here. So what's going on? Are we looking at a, like a victory on behalf of [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1093.28s)]
*  the United States against these revisionist powers? Is that how you view this? Is that, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1099.2s)]
*  is that the right lens? Thanks, John. No, as you, as you know, well, and some of the viewers may [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1104.8s)]
*  not, we're conducting a major year long project here at FDD on the axis of aggressors involving [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1109.36s)]
*  all three of our centers, including the one that, that Monte leads. And, and what we've observed is [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1114.48s)]
*  that we've seen growing cooperation across virtually all domains of power between China, Russia, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1119.44s)]
*  Iran, and North Korea. We know that Iran has provided thousands of these Shahed drones to [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1124.6399999999999s)]
*  Putin that he's used to attack Ukrainian men, women, and children. They've provided Russia [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1129.28s)]
*  short range ballistic missiles. They, Iran has created IOUs in the Kremlin. And of course, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1134.48s)]
*  in the news, we see the Iranian foreign minister meeting with Putin just in the last day or so. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  And Putin unsurprisingly condemned the U.S. tax. He talked about good relations between Tehran and [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1144.24s)]
*  the Kremlin. And he said that we, the Kremlin, are making efforts to support the Iranian people. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1149.76s)]
*  It's TBD what that means. That might be, it's obviously deliberately vague, but if, if Russia [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1156.08s)]
*  were to provide S-4, S-3, more S-300 or S-400s, or provide advanced fighters, intelligence support, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1161.6799999999998s)]
*  that could be a real problem for the United States and Israel. And let's remember that Russia helped [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  build the Bashir nuclear reactor, as you all know. And according to some sources, you know, there's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1174.24s)]
*  as many as, I think Putin may have said this, as many as 200 Russians still at Bashir. And Putin [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1179.36s)]
*  said, thank you, Israel, for a quote, ensuring or ensuring the safety of those Russians. So, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1185.44s)]
*  this is an example of the longstanding and deep relationship between Iran and Russia. Russia is [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1191.28s)]
*  obviously no friend of Israel and no friend of Middle East stability. Russia is very happy to see [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1197.68s)]
*  increases in energy prices, whereas China, on the other hand, is very, does not want to see Middle [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1202.72s)]
*  East instability, does not want to see the shedding of the Strait of Hormuz because they rely [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1208.16s)]
*  significantly on the export of oil through the Strait of Hormuz. And so, those are some of the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1212.96s)]
*  things I'm watching. But the bottom line, and I'll end with this, is that when the United States is [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1218.08s)]
*  confronting the most daunting geostrategic environment we've seen since 1945, and our [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1222.0s)]
*  adversaries are appreciating the value of partners, China, Russia, and North Korea, when you have an [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1227.04s)]
*  ally like Israel that is motivated and capable to go after one of those Axis members, that's [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1231.2s)]
*  supporting that partner, in this case, Israel, is not charity. It's a wise investment because at [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1237.68s)]
*  this moment we need all the help we can get, and Israel is providing us decisive help with respect [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1242.4s)]
*  to one of the members of the Axis, frankly, the weakest member and the only member that doesn't [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1247.3600000000001s)]
*  have nuclear weapons, and we want to keep it that way. Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, I will say, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1251.52s)]
*  you know, we've broadened this out, you know, when you see the Ukrainians taking it to the Russians, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  when you see the Israelis taking it to Iran, this is all beneficial, right? This is just bonus time [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1260.5600000000002s)]
*  for the United States. We get to weaken our enemies, you know, through our allies, and I [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1266.72s)]
*  think you're right, this is not charity. I think it's important. Of course, we are hearing concerns [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1272.8s)]
*  on the part of isolationists here in the United States, people saying that, you know, we're getting [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1277.28s)]
*  ourselves drawn into a longer war. I don't see evidence of that right now, and we're certainly [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1281.2s)]
*  not engaging in, you know, we're not trying to do state building here, we're not trying to create [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1285.76s)]
*  Jeffersonian democracy in Iran, we're not trying to put, we're not going to be putting boots on the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1290.56s)]
*  ground, we're not trying, I mean, this is not what the United States is doing, we're empowering [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1295.76s)]
*  our allies to weaken our enemies, and I do think that that is crucial. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1300.48s)]
*  Benham, I want to turn to you, our resident Iran specialist here on this program this morning. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1304.96s)]
*  I want to ask you first, you've done a lot of work on Iranian missiles. Now, I don't want you to get, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1310.8s)]
*  you know, geek out too hard here on all the different types, I, you know, I mean, let's keep [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  this at, you know, I don't know, 10,000 feet, but I do want to ask you, what do they have left in the [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1321.44s)]
*  tank? I mean, the Israelis right now, we know they're out there with those F-35s, and they're [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1328.48s)]
*  just circling above looking for those launchers, looking for the ballistic missiles. What is going [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1333.2s)]
*  on when you look at that? How much is there left in the tank for the Iranian regime? What kind of [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1340.3200000000002s)]
*  threat do they pose? It seems like it was actually a fairly quiet night last night in Israel. I did [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1347.28s)]
*  see this morning that there were as many as seven missiles launched, but we're not looking at those, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1352.72s)]
*  like, 200 when I was in a bunker in Israel, we were waiting for all of them to come all at once. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1357.6s)]
*  It does seem like it's, you know, it's diminished a little bit. Am I wrong here? Do they have [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1363.28s)]
*  many more that they can fire? What's going on? Greetings, John, it's an excellent question, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1369.84s)]
*  great to be with you, and greetings to Mark and Brad and all the viewers and listeners as well. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1374.4s)]
*  This is really the million dollar question here, because the main vector of the threat that the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1379.2800000000002s)]
*  Islamic Republic poses as it continues its war against Israel is to launch medium-range ballistic [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1383.92s)]
*  missiles from its own territory, occasionally layering that with unsuccessful drone attacks [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1389.44s)]
*  that are intercepted by U.S., Israeli, and allied air forces before entering Israeli airspace. But [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1395.44s)]
*  the large bulk, we could say, of Iran's response is defined by these ballistic missile operations. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1401.12s)]
*  Now, unpacking that arsenal before these operations begin, before the June 12, June 13 trigger [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1407.84s)]
*  for this latest round of the Israel-Iran shadow war coming out of the shadows, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1413.6s)]
*  Iran had the largest and the most diverse ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1418.32s)]
*  You don't really have good open source public numbers for that. We've had U.S. officials in [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1423.04s)]
*  2021 and 2023 say about 3,000. I think that's the back of the envelope assessment, and I think [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1427.12s)]
*  actually it was a more conservative assessment than meets the eye. What I'm hearing, what I'm [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1433.04s)]
*  seeing, what I'm kind of doing, my own back of the envelope assessment is that 2,500 to 3,000 [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1439.76s)]
*  potentially could have been MRBMs, because Iran has been producing a whole host of SRBMs, which are [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1446.56s)]
*  short-range ballistic missiles, in the 2017 to present period. And I think they've stepped them [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1451.76s)]
*  up since 2020, which is the last time, and in fact the only time, the Islamic Republic [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1457.6s)]
*  directly launched ballistic missiles from its own territory at U.S. positions. And that was a [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1462.16s)]
*  historical moment, because that was the response to the Qasem Soleimani strike in January 2020 in Iraq. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1466.8s)]
*  And then also, that was the largest ever single ballistic missile operation U.S. forces had [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1474.32s)]
*  experienced since the end of World War II. More importantly, I would say that the Israelis have [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1480.08s)]
*  had a very successful left of launch mission against the Islamic Republic. There's a back [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1486.8s)]
*  of the envelope assessment as to how many launchers the regime has. Some say between 400 and 500. I [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  think the number there is actually more liberal. We should go down a little bit. And what you're [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1498.56s)]
*  seeing from the Israeli source is saying about 40% of the launch infrastructure, which includes these [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1502.8s)]
*  transporter erector launchers, have been taken out, which means that you could have the biggest [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1507.84s)]
*  arsenal in the world, but if you don't have the capability or the means to fire them, you're not [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1512.32s)]
*  going to be able to respond in kind, as the Iranians are intent on doing. And here I would point to a [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  couple of longer-range Israeli strikes against this arsenal, largely against the medium-range [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1521.28s)]
*  ballistic missile arsenal, including a strike against a base in the city of Yazd. Yazd is about [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1527.04s)]
*  2,300 kilometers from Tel Aviv. You've seen the Iranian strategy, which started with a whole host [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1532.72s)]
*  of single-stage solid propellant medium-range ballistic missiles fired all the way from [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  Western Iran, where there's a constellation of bases right around the Zagros mountain chain, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1545.3600000000001s)]
*  benefiting from the natural geography there, essentially all be taken out from Tabriz [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1550.32s)]
*  in the north, to Karaman Shah in the middle, to Ahlulz and Khuzestan in the south. Given the loss [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1554.72s)]
*  of these more precise ballistic missiles, you've seen the change in the volley size, and Iran have [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1560.72s)]
*  to move from firing in its west to firing in its center. Now Yazd is almost going further to the [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1566.0s)]
*  east, past the center, and according to Israeli sources, the reason for the strike against Yazd [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1572.24s)]
*  was because Yazd is a garrison that allegedly has or houses the Khurramshahr ballistic missile. We [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1577.28s)]
*  have never seen the Khurramshahr ballistic missile ever used in a public missile operation from the [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1584.8s)]
*  Iranians once they started that in 2017, and we've never seen them use that against the Israelis. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1590.8s)]
*  But it's actually a modified and improved North Korean ballistic missile. It's really one of the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1595.52s)]
*  few times in the past decade and a half Iran has gotten something and upgraded it, and had it be [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1600.48s)]
*  better than the original North Korean version. And the reason it matters here is because as the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1604.8s)]
*  regime is engaging in a counter-value campaign, meaning they're targeting Israeli civilian [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1608.8799999999999s)]
*  population centers, cities that you were in, John, for example, they are losing a lot more missiles, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1613.44s)]
*  but they are kind of benefiting from the fact that they're still hitting stuff. And the reason [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1620.0s)]
*  the Khurramshahr battles here is because it's the heaviest warhead. The Khurramshahr missile has a [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1624.16s)]
*  two-ton warhead, a 2,000 kilogram warhead. This is big. What we're trying to say here is that [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1628.96s)]
*  there's more in the tank, that they have the ability to fire heavier missiles, and they could [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1634.88s)]
*  do more damage, and we've already seen that there's already massive damage. So this thing's far [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1639.1200000000001s)]
*  from done, but it does, we do get the sense that those missile launchers, they're diminishing in [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1643.36s)]
*  number. The missile stores themselves also may be diminishing in number, but it does feel like a [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1648.08s)]
*  battle against time for the Israelis because the longer that Iran has the ability to do this, the [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1653.1999999999998s)]
*  regime in Iran has the ability to do this, the more Israel is going to sustain incoming missile [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1658.32s)]
*  fire. That's of course dangerous. Bethan, I want to ask you one last question. We're going to get to [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1663.04s)]
*  a lightning round just in terms of what everybody's looking for next before we hop off. So Mark and [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1667.12s)]
*  Brad, be ready for that answer. But BBT, for now, I do want to ask you just in terms of the regime [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1672.88s)]
*  itself, the paranoia, the fact that they don't control their own airspace, the fact that they [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1680.24s)]
*  are now under assault by Israel 24-7, the fact that elements of the regime involved in the [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1686.16s)]
*  repression of the society, that they're beginning to crumble here and there. I've got to imagine [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1694.24s)]
*  that this is not playing well. What are the prospects for this regime right now as you look [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1699.76s)]
*  at the way that messaging is coming out, when you look at media, when you look at the diaspora [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1704.8799999999999s)]
*  talking about this from outside the country? What is going on here? How do you break it down for us? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1709.92s)]
*  Well, there's no doubt that the regime is between a rock and a hard place here. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1715.76s)]
*  Their ideology boxes them in with the options available to them if it's like surrender or [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1719.52s)]
*  submit versus continue their resistance. Khamenei's ideology and natural inclination here is somehow [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1724.48s)]
*  to fight to live another day, but also there's a desire to need to be seen as responding, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1729.68s)]
*  a desire to need to be seen as responding kinetically and a desire to potentially draw [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1734.3200000000002s)]
*  blood given what was taken away from this regime. I mean, make no mistake, we've all been hearing [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1738.64s)]
*  and talking about these facilities for almost two decades now. Only one person essentially took them [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1742.96s)]
*  off of the table. So the Iranians are going to be looking for a very public response that tries to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1747.68s)]
*  hit something of equal value to what was their crown jewel. The problem is, and you have this [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1752.5600000000002s)]
*  problem in international relations a lot, and particularly with authoritarian regimes that are [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1757.44s)]
*  dealt a serious military blow, how do you respond in a way that allows you to save face, but that [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1761.76s)]
*  doesn't end up leading to you losing your head? And if the regime, for example, fires short-range [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1767.44s)]
*  ballistic missiles at bases that are American, for example, you may have a much stronger American [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1772.56s)]
*  military response. Conversely, if the regime does nothing, it'll be under pressure both from its [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1778.24s)]
*  left flank and its right flank in society. The left flank being the anti-regime population, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1783.68s)]
*  which actually applauded the Israeli strikes on June 12, June 13 against the IRGC leadership, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1788.64s)]
*  as well as the increasingly minority ultra hardline fashion of support that the regime has within [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1794.5600000000002s)]
*  elites and within society. You could say probably less than 15 to 10 percent. And those folks [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1800.5600000000002s)]
*  actually are proponents of common escalating harder and faster and are saying, had we had a nuclear [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1806.3200000000002s)]
*  weapon already, these things wouldn't happen. So the Israelis are putting the political stressors [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1810.72s)]
*  on the Iranian decision-making apparatus as much as they are putting on the military stressors [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1815.92s)]
*  on this regime. And the diaspora abroad, particularly in Western democracies, is watching [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1821.04s)]
*  this as well. The big question for the diaspora is, which is because they've been divided over [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1826.0s)]
*  this because this is the first direct U.S.-Iran military action in the 46-year history of the [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1829.76s)]
*  Islamic Republic that has meaningfully come onto Iranian territory, and there's concerns of a wider [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1834.16s)]
*  war here, everybody privately is messaging me, regardless of their political orientation [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1838.96s)]
*  and regardless of their view of war, deal, no deal, whatever, which is to say that if this regime [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1843.68s)]
*  is still left standing after the counterproliferation operation, that which will be locked in is a [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1849.3600000000001s)]
*  totalitarian terror akin to Saddam in the 90s after the first Persian Gulf War. And that's the [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1854.88s)]
*  real fear here that if the U.S. kind of calls it quits and Khamenei somehow manages to drink the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1860.16s)]
*  poison chalice like his predecessor in 1988, Ayatollah Khamenei, when he ended the Iran-Iraq War, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1864.8s)]
*  the regime may still be intact and lose its aggressive apparatus, but it will have just [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1870.1599999999999s)]
*  enough capacity for that repressive apparatus at home. And that's why the Israeli strikes against [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1875.12s)]
*  that repressive apparatus can actually do a lot to shape the post-campaign environment of the street [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1880.24s)]
*  against the state. Yeah. All right. That's great. Great summary. Guys, I'm going to ask you each, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  we're going to try to wrap up here. We've gone a little longer than normal today, but these are [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1892.96s)]
*  exceptional days. So I think it's more than justified. So, Monty, let me ask you, what are [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1896.8s)]
*  you looking for today or over the next couple of days? What are the things that you're tracking [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1902.08s)]
*  that are most important to you? You know, it does Iran counterstrike against the United States [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1906.72s)]
*  because if they do, then we're in a, you know, despite what the president would like, which is [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1913.76s)]
*  a lot of us would like. We're going to be involved in a more extensive air campaign [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1918.64s)]
*  and supplanting the IDF as the primary striker. We have 200 fighter attack aircraft in the region [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  between the Navy and the Air Force, and we will be using them. I hope that doesn't happen, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1932.0s)]
*  the balls in Iran's court, but I think there's probably a more than 50% chance that that happens. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1936.96s)]
*  Hmm. All right. Brad, over to you. What are you watching? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1943.84s)]
*  How does Iran respond? Does the U.S. learn the lesson of January 2020 that if you, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1948.8799999999999s)]
*  and our experiences in Iraq and Syria, that if you fail to respond or fail to respond strongly, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1955.4399999999998s)]
*  invites more aggression. So does President Trump mean what he say in terms of the response? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1960.56s)]
*  Do we hit back hard if they hit us? What kind of cooperation do we see among the acts of aggressors [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1965.1999999999998s)]
*  in terms of helping Iran? Are we taking all of the force protection measures we need? And are [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1971.12s)]
*  we doing everything we can to support our ally Israel in this moment? All right. BBT, last word [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1975.84s)]
*  for you. I'll be very quick. I was inspired yesterday by the tweet the president had about [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1981.6s)]
*  potentially making Iran great again. I don't think he's there at the regime change moment just yet, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1986.8s)]
*  but the real concern I have here is counter proliferation, meaning the counter proliferation [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1992.0s)]
*  success that the U.S. may have may actually push the regime to do more of what you've seen, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=1997.52s)]
*  which is this allegation that the strikes may have been successful in collapsing the facility, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2005.76s)]
*  but equally important as the facility is the fissile material in those facilities. And so [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2010.72s)]
*  what I'm worried about right now is a loose fissile material scenario, given that every [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2015.68s)]
*  known Iranian facility that was struck in this operation was once an unknown Iranian facility. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2019.84s)]
*  And if the regime has managed to squirrel away canisters of uranium pre-strike and moved it to [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2025.84s)]
*  an undisclosed and unknown location, we're going to have a massive intelligence game of cat and [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2030.9599999999998s)]
*  mouse on our hands that actually could be the way the regime dates and bleeds America and Israel into [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2035.28s)]
*  much longer war. And just as a side note, anytime across three continents, I've been asked to role [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2039.76s)]
*  play the Iranians in a war game. This is what I do when I'm struck. And this is how I force a war [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2045.28s)]
*  that America or Israel does not want onto them. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2051.2s)]
*  All right, we're going to leave it there, guys. I'm going to just tell you right now, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2055.68s)]
*  I'm watching my screen here, watching the Israeli media, and it looks like the Israelis are still [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2058.72s)]
*  actually striking fordo. I have actually seen reports pop on my screen just in the last little [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2064.7999999999997s)]
*  bit that there was a collapse there, whether it was a total collapse at fordo or partial. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2070.16s)]
*  We're still trying to figure this out, but I am getting at least some headlines. Also, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2074.88s)]
*  I think a headline that's worth noting is that the Israelis took out the key general in the [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2079.28s)]
*  regime that was responsible for providing direction to Hamas. This is also important [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2083.28s)]
*  because these fronts are interconnected, folks. We've been saying this all the way along, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2089.1200000000003s)]
*  that this was a seven front war, that it was being directed by the regime in Iran. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2094.1600000000003s)]
*  And right now we're watching the interconnectivity of all of these fronts and perhaps the collapse of [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  the regime across all of them, if not most. This is an exceptional time to be watching the news. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2104.08s)]
*  I am thrilled that we've had three unbelievable experts to join us this morning. I don't know [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2111.12s)]
*  whether we're going to be going back to the old format of the FTD morning brief or whether we're [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2116.08s)]
*  going to be keeping it up with this sitrep format. I think a lot of that is just going to be headline [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2120.0s)]
*  dependent. But until then, I want to thank you for joining us this morning for this special sitrep [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2125.36s)]
*  version of the FTD morning brief. As always, I'm Jonathan Schanzer, signing off for FTD. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6W71PYx08U&t=2131.6s)]
