# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Behnam Ben Taleblu (Jun. 18)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE)
*  Good morning. It's Wednesday, June 18th. The multi-front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=0.0s)]
*  621 days old. I'm your host, FTD Senior Research Analyst Natalie Icano, filling in for Jonathan [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=24.28s)]
*  Schanzer. Welcome back to the FTD Morning Brief. Today's guest is Benham Ben-Taliblu, FTD Iran [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=30.48s)]
*  Program Senior Director and Senior Fellow. He's our very own in-house missile expert, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=36.44s)]
*  so he's the perfect guest to help us make sense of the latest developments in the war between [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=40.6s)]
*  Israel and Iran. Stay tuned for that conversation coming your way in a few short minutes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=44.28s)]
*  I occasionally step in as John's understudy for this program, and if you've tuned into [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=50.28s)]
*  my episodes, you'll know that I usually take this opportunity to bring you up to speed on the Qatar [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=54.04s)]
*  file. I still have plenty to say on that front. In fact, I was planning to tell you all about Qatar [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=58.2s)]
*  and the Muslim Brotherhood on last Friday's episode. For reasons having to do with a country that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=63.08s)]
*  starts with I and ends with RAN, plans changed. My eyes have since been glued to my screen. Missiles [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=67.48s)]
*  flying to Iran, then to Israel, then back to Iran. Iran's chain of command crumbling before our eyes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=72.68s)]
*  It's jaw-dropping history-making stuff. My colleague Benham is the one to help us unpack [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=77.88s)]
*  the real nitty-gritty, so bear with me as I stick to the Qatar beat for a moment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=82.68s)]
*  In case you missed it, the Qataris are patrons of the Sunni jihadists who unseated Bashar al-Assad. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=86.68s)]
*  Assad was an Iranian client. You'd think that dynamic would not a friendship make. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=91.64000000000001s)]
*  Wrong. As it happens, Qatar and Iran have buried their Syrian hatchet. Isn't that sweet? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  The Qataris and Iranians think of each other as brothers. That's their word, not mine. They've [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=102.28s)]
*  signed economic and cultural cooperation agreements, they've worked together to sidestep [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  maximum pressure. Heck, the Iranians showcased their drones and missiles at an international [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=110.84s)]
*  arms expo in Doha last year. So no, I wasn't surprised when Qatar condemned Israel over [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=115.0s)]
*  the weekend and joined Team Iran. And no, I wasn't surprised when Iran dialed Qatar to appeal for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  diplomatic help. Tell me again, why are the Qataris our major non-NATO allies? I'll wait. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  Now for your headlines. Headline one. 20 Arab and Islamic countries signed a statement calling [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  on Israel to stop striking Iran. Qatar was one, along with American allies like Egypt, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=137.48s)]
*  Jordan, and Turkey. The joint statement categorically condemned Israel and called [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=142.28s)]
*  on the IDF to stop the action in Iran immediately. Then came the usual accusation that Israel is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=146.12s)]
*  violating international law in the United Nations Charter. The joint statement called for [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=151.16s)]
*  de-escalation and dialogue. And then it made a couple of truly ironic statements. First, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=155.56s)]
*  the 20 signatories called on all countries in the Middle East to sign the non-proliferation [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=160.6s)]
*  treaty known as the NPT. I guess they didn't get the memo that Iran is trying to pull out of the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=164.68s)]
*  NPT as we speak. The signatories also stressed the importance of maritime security. But last [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=169.56s)]
*  I checked, the Houthis are the ones stirring trouble in the sea. And who's bankrolling the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=175.0s)]
*  Houthis? The Iranians. Headline two. Another important elimination in Iran yesterday. The [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=178.52s)]
*  IDF took out Major General Ali Shadmani. He was the head of Iran's military emergency command [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=184.68s)]
*  overseeing the IRGC and the Iranian armed forces. Think of him as Iran's war chief of staff. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=191.08s)]
*  According to the IDF, Shadmani was the senior most Iranian military official and the closest [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=197.0s)]
*  remaining military advisor to Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Shadmani was on the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=201.56s)]
*  job for all of four days. The IDF killed his predecessor on Friday. But rest assured, Shadmani [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=206.84s)]
*  made the most of his 96 hours at the top. The IDF said he oversaw combat operations and was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=211.96s)]
*  responsible for approving Iranian attack plans. And headline three. Two Israeli soldiers were [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=216.6s)]
*  killed in Gaza. In one incident, a 28-year-old deputy company commander was killed in Khamunis [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=222.84s)]
*  by an explosive device planted inside a building. Another soldier was killed and 10 others were [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=227.88s)]
*  wounded in the second incident hours later. According to an initial IDF probe, the soldiers [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=232.44s)]
*  were traveling in an armored personnel carrier when a terrorist planted an explosive device on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=237.32s)]
*  their vehicle. The blast killed one and seriously wounded four. Three soldiers were moderately [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=241.64s)]
*  injured and three sustained light injuries. The two fatalities were the second and third IDF [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=246.04s)]
*  fatalities in Gaza since Israel launched Operation Rising Lion. A good reminder that even though [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  Israel's operation in Iran is dominating headlines, the battle in Gaza isn't over. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=255.56s)]
*  Okay, it's time for my conversation with senior director of FTD's Iran program, Benham Ben Talablu. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=260.92s)]
*  Let's dive right in. Welcome to the program, Benham. Good morning, Natalie. Great to be back [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=265.64s)]
*  with you guys. So I want to just jump right into what you are an expert on and that's Iran's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=274.2s)]
*  arsenal. Can you just give us a sense of the capabilities that Iran has and what might be [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=280.2s)]
*  left and what we can look forward to seeing in the future? Sure. So heading into June 12, June 13, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=284.76s)]
*  the Islamic Republic of Iran was home to the largest ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=292.52s)]
*  East. This is composed of close range, short range, and medium range ballistic missiles [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=297.8s)]
*  that are both liquid and solid fueled. After the five-ish days now of the Israeli-Iran exchanges [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=302.76s)]
*  with the regime firing upwards of 380 to 400, probably by the end of today or tomorrow, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=310.44s)]
*  medium range ballistic missiles at Israel. Plus, of course, the things you guys have been seeing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  on the news and more likely on social media of the Israelis being able to engage in this thing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=321.56s)]
*  called left of launch operations. That's basically when you do whatever you can non-kinetically or [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=327.4s)]
*  kinetically to take out missiles before they are launched. And in this case, you've seen lots of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  videos circulating of both launchers being taken out and disabled by the IDF and IAF, as well as, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=340.2s)]
*  of course, missiles themselves. So there's lots of debate right now in the open source world, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  how many medium range ballistic missiles, that's the distance needed to traverse Iranian territory [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=352.28s)]
*  to Israeli territory. It's a little over or under 1,400 kilometers. How many of those does Iran have? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=358.11999999999995s)]
*  If you believe the debate started with 2,000 of the 3,000, you're probably down almost around the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=363.64s)]
*  low four digits. If you believe it started with 1,000, then you're probably down even significantly [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  more than that. And this is the bind the Israelis are trying to put the Iranians in because you know [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=376.2s)]
*  the Israelis have been fighting a multi-front war. You know they've been fighting adversaries who [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=381.56s)]
*  simply quantitatively have more arms than them. The Israelis have been able to take that quantitative [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=385.32s)]
*  advantage that the Iranians have and flip it on its head by both successfully intercepting many, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=391.56s)]
*  but not all, unfortunately, of the Iranian direct ballistic missile attacks. And then on the other [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=397.48s)]
*  side, go after their arsenal and shrink their arsenal, as well as shrink the capability of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=403.32s)]
*  them to continue to launch. And you see the Israel is moving from the first chain of bases [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  in Western Iran to a second chain of bases in central Iran. And this is designed to keep [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=413.79999999999995s)]
*  the regime going back, back, back, and to go after the capability and even the will of them to keep [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=419.0s)]
*  firing. Unfortunately, the will part still has not been impacted yet, but the more the regime fires, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=425.24s)]
*  the more it knows it will have less for any potential future fights with Israel or any adversary [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=430.68s)]
*  that is far away. And this is designed to impact the regime's thinking about its future survival. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=436.12s)]
*  So the Israelis are fighting, I would say, multi-domain against the Iranian missile threat here. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=441.16s)]
*  Israel miraculously has been able to intercept most of the incoming missiles, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=450.04s)]
*  but Israel's done a lot more over the last, what is it, four or five days in Iran. Can you just [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=454.44s)]
*  give us a breakdown of what exactly the Israelis have been able to achieve so far? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=458.2s)]
*  Let me also just say my heart goes out to civilians on both sides of this conflict, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=462.28s)]
*  but also we have had colleagues and friends in Israel. No joke, I was supposed to be in [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  Israel on Monday and all the weekend we were glued to the screen. And I had actually, just a small [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  anecdote, never been in Israel during a time of crisis. So never during the May 2021 war, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  for example, or previous rocket exchanges with Hezbollah or Hamas. And this was supposed to be [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=485.32s)]
*  my first post-October 7 trip to Israel. The reason I'm mentioning this is because [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=490.04s)]
*  one of those Iranian ballistic missiles actually did penetrate a shelter killing three to four [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=495.32s)]
*  people. And as we see the conflict evolve in places where we still have quantitatively more [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=499.72s)]
*  successful Israeli interceptions, the Iranians may move from using 450 to 500 kilogram warheads [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=505.32000000000005s)]
*  to, as they fear more about things related to regime survival, potentially larger and heavier [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  warheads. So in the off chance that those are not intercepted, the blast impact or the ability of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=517.64s)]
*  some of these things to burrow does raise. So these are things that I'm thinking about as we [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=522.76s)]
*  continue to see the war unfold over the next few days. And to the heart of your question, sorry, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=527.8s)]
*  I interrupted. Can you repeat it one more time? Yeah, sure. What have the Israelis been able to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=534.04s)]
*  achieve over the last few days in Iran? Borderline air superiority. I say borderline because even [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=538.76s)]
*  though the Israelis have struck a target in the northeastern city of Mashhad, way much, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=544.28s)]
*  much farther away than even they may have even needed to strike, the Israelis are concentrating [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=551.64s)]
*  on Western and then parts of central Iran to be able to make sure that they are basically [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  uncontested. The real nut graph here is that as much as folks are focusing on the overt side, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=560.36s)]
*  so the airstrike side, what enabled this really successful Israeli military operation was of course [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=566.04s)]
*  the thing that enabled much of Israel's successes, particularly against Hezbollah during the battles [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=573.72s)]
*  of the post-October 7 Middle East and particularly what we saw in the fall of 2024, which is the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=578.9200000000001s)]
*  ability to go after decision-making, command and control structures, and the strategic brain trust [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=584.52s)]
*  of its adversary. So in this case, the fact that the Israelis began a conflict with already a [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=590.76s)]
*  conventionally inferior adversary by having their commands taken out, you basically have had the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=596.84s)]
*  who's who of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps gone, multiple Iranian nuclear scientists gone, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=602.52s)]
*  almost all of Iran's more layered air and missile defenses gone, tons of short and medium range [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=607.64s)]
*  radars gone that would allow the Israelis basically to be uncontested in Western and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=614.52s)]
*  Central Iran. They have air superiority there now, and the fact that they can marry this [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  conventional overt military infrastructure with still what they have in the country, which is [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=625.0s)]
*  these guys have been able to build covert drone bases that have been going after those Iranian [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=630.2s)]
*  launch capabilities as well. Again, this drone footage is being shared by the IDF and IAF [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=636.6800000000001s)]
*  on social media, so the Israelis are showing both from the overt and the covert side, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=641.96s)]
*  both from the conventional and the unconventional side, how they've been able to put the Iranians [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  in a pincer and force them to make decisions that were much less professional from military [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  perspective and force them really into making mistakes. You're seeing this unfold right before [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=656.84s)]
*  our eyes because there's a tier one military fighting a tier three terror sponsor. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=664.36s)]
*  When you have that dynamic of a tier one military fighting a tier three terror sponsor, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=671.72s)]
*  is there any strategy that you see the Iranians pursuing or is this sort of spur of the moment [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=676.12s)]
*  decision making and sort of do what you can to get the job done? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=680.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, I was trying to tell the press this all weekend, the Iranians, the capabilities they have, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=685.16s)]
*  you know, they know conventionally they are outgunned, but the capabilities they have makes [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=691.64s)]
*  them excellent crisis bargainers or basically all of the things pre-war, their arsenal, their [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=696.44s)]
*  capabilities are well suited to that, but to sustain a war that goes obviously to a much more [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=702.84s)]
*  high tech, much more conventionally capable military. And as again, the Israeli-Iran shadow [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=708.28s)]
*  war moved out of the shadows in 2024, the Israelis realized I think that they could [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=713.08s)]
*  drive the Iranians into making mistakes. Now, I think one area where the Iranians think that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=717.48s)]
*  they're winning, but they're making a gigantic mistake is the counter value strikes. So, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=721.72s)]
*  counter value strikes are these large ballistic missile barrages against civilian population [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=726.12s)]
*  centers. You've seen them at places like Ramat Gan, Haifa, Tel Aviv, the suburbs of Jerusalem, even [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  if you have the home front command, you'll even see shelter warnings for places as far [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=738.12s)]
*  north as Akko or as far east as Ayn Zeban, for example. So, the missile threat to civilian centers [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=742.68s)]
*  is how the regime is trying to play it here by a drawing blood so that the regime gets a status [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=750.5999999999999s)]
*  dividend of having responded, that's one. Two, the propaganda war after having drawn blood or after [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=756.5999999999999s)]
*  being able to interrupt the normal pattern of life that is Israel. Then the third obviously is to [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=762.68s)]
*  actually erode the will of the Israelis to stay in the fight over time. Here, I think if they know [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=769.24s)]
*  even anything remotely about Israeli history, they would be misreading the situation, but [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=773.88s)]
*  nonetheless, this is actually part of their military strategy. And then even to deter [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=778.2s)]
*  American involvement, you may have seen a New York Times story yesterday talking about [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  the potential for the Iranians are preparing missiles to be fired at much more closer targets [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=788.12s)]
*  like US bases in case the Americans come in. You've heard the Iranians talk about leaving the NPT, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=794.28s)]
*  you've heard the Iranians at the same time talk about potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=799.32s)]
*  By threatening to widen the war without first widening the war, they're hoping to play to the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=804.44s)]
*  more restrained elements, the more responsible, the more kind of conservative element in American [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=809.24s)]
*  foreign policy that will worry about the implications of a wider war. And instead of having America [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=814.28s)]
*  enter as Israel's partner, they're hoping to have America enter as a de-conflictor in the war between [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=819.24s)]
*  Israel and Iran, basically put a stop to it, and then essentially have them live to fight another day. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=825.24s)]
*  Well, let's shift gears a minute to the Iranian people. I think there's been a lot of talk on [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  social media and in print media about the idea of regime change in the fall of the Islamic Republic. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=836.6s)]
*  How are you seeing the Iranian people react? And do you think that this is sort of turning, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=841.88s)]
*  going to turn a new leaf in the history of the country? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=846.36s)]
*  It's a kaleidoscopic reaction. The first thing let me tell you is that large swaths of the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=849.88s)]
*  Iranian society are against the state. You've seen that war between the society and the state [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=853.8s)]
*  manifest itself in boom and bust periods of sustained anti-regime protests from 2017 to present [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=859.7199999999999s)]
*  that make it clear that reform is not what the Iranian population is seeking. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=865.56s)]
*  They're seeking wholesale revolution. You know, the Israeli war is not against the Iranian people, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=869.4799999999999s)]
*  and the Iranian war is not a war of the Iranian people against the Israeli people or the Israeli [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=874.5999999999999s)]
*  state. It's this regime interest that is being fought and preserved and sustained here, not the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=879.32s)]
*  Iranian national interest. The reason I'm saying that is because you've had rounds of protests from [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=884.44s)]
*  2009 to present in Iran saying, not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life only for Iran. And we are living [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=888.6s)]
*  through a world right now of a government quite literally having prioritized the opposite, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=894.6800000000001s)]
*  prioritizing Hezbollah, prioritizing Hamas, prioritizing the destruction of the state of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=899.0s)]
*  Israel over the public good and national interest of its own people. And the reason we say that is [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=903.4000000000001s)]
*  because as the first and second waves of Israeli attacks happened, the broad kind of consensus [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=908.36s)]
*  on social media and even people you would kind of be able to ask within country was broadly [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=914.2s)]
*  celebratory. You know, obviously no one wants to see an attack on their territory, but because they [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=919.16s)]
*  saw basically the command and control structure of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps gutted, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=923.4s)]
*  and a lot of the military capabilities that the regime had invested in rather than investing in [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=930.28s)]
*  the population and critical infrastructure at home basically yet to be gutted as well, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=934.44s)]
*  there was celebrations. People were broadly supportive. But again, public opinion is very [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=939.32s)]
*  kaleidoscopic. And the more the war has gone on from a targeted campaign into really five, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=943.96s)]
*  six days of a direct Israel-Iran exchange and the most significant sustained foreign military [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=949.8000000000001s)]
*  operations against Iranian territory since the end of the Iran-Iraq War, the civilian casualty [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=956.0400000000001s)]
*  count grew and obviously the concern grew. So everybody in Iran right now, regardless of your [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=961.16s)]
*  orientation, anti-regime or pro-regime, is in survival mode. Tehran, for example, is a town [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=966.28s)]
*  that is continuing to get some of its military and political installations struck. That is [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=972.6s)]
*  essentially where you have about 10 million plus people, many who have been trying to flee. Some [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=977.3199999999999s)]
*  have been abandoning cars on highways. Some have, they all essentially have zero shelter. So you [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=981.64s)]
*  couldn't have a sharper divide between what the Israeli government has provided for its own people [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=987.4s)]
*  and what the Iranian government has refused to even bother to think about, let alone to have to [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=992.12s)]
*  provide for its own people. So the contrast is stark. I know you see in the Israeli public [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=996.52s)]
*  messaging an attempt to drive the Iranian population to become another vector of pressure [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1001.72s)]
*  against the regime as the Israelis also continue the campaign. But when everyone is in survival [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1007.16s)]
*  mode right now and when everyone continues to say regime change is not what they want, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1012.12s)]
*  that can lead to really a mismatch between intention and capability. But perhaps things [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1016.4399999999999s)]
*  may be changing if the targeting becomes much more limited, if the fire is able to be more [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1021.0s)]
*  controlled or turned off in some areas, and if the messaging is all about going after the oppressors [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1025.72s)]
*  of the Iranian people. And the Israelis have been doing that to a fair amount anyway. It's just, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1032.28s)]
*  as always, a translation campaign. I mean, the fact that they hit IRIB, a major state broadcaster, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1036.28s)]
*  Iranians have seen literally on their homes the Islamist regime's authoritarian repressive apparatus [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1041.8s)]
*  bring tortured confessions on IRIB, bring foreign nationals that they've paraded on spies on IRIB. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1049.0s)]
*  You couldn't even have a sharper image of what is going on right now and how weak the regime is [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1055.96s)]
*  than this image I'm about to tell you, which has been going viral on social media since the Israelis [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1064.28s)]
*  struck IRIB, which is Tehran, all basically this part safe and sound, one burning building in the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1068.9199999999998s)]
*  middle with flames coming up out of it and the call to prayer in the background on that building [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1076.9199999999998s)]
*  is IRIB and it's a haunting reminder of how lethal but also how weak this regime is and how different [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1081.56s)]
*  the war is for the regime versus how different it is for the Iranian people. The Iranian people [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1089.9599999999998s)]
*  are a very nationalistic people and the fact that you still have them applauding strikes against [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1095.88s)]
*  their oppressors and still have them looking at the conflict this way tells you so much about how [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1101.16s)]
*  badly the Islamic Republic has botched everything at home for the past 46 years. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1106.68s)]
*  One last question before I let you go and it's a big one that I think is, you know, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1113.3200000000002s)]
*  swirling around a lot of Americans' minds. What do you think the role the U.S. should be playing? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1116.44s)]
*  What role should the Trump administration sort of pursue? Do you think we're going to get involved [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1121.24s)]
*  go ahead? Well it'd be hard to recommend something in less than a minute so let me just say this, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1126.1200000000001s)]
*  full backstop the U.S. has to make sure that we are there to help with the track, detect, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1131.56s)]
*  and destroy mission when it comes to the Iranian ballistic missile barrages. I think in terms of [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1136.68s)]
*  deterrent posture we need to bolster our posture in the region which is exactly what you see with [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1141.0s)]
*  some more naval assets coming in. I think in terms of messaging however there's been lots of public [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1145.64s)]
*  messaging by the president about what the, you know, is the supreme leader a target? Is he not [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1150.6000000000001s)]
*  a target? Is surrender an option? Is a deal an option? I think the fact that the messaging is [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1155.08s)]
*  changing so often can actually be counterproductive. I actually think quiet can actually induce fear and [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1159.3999999999999s)]
*  then a private communique appears what you need to do. You know where to find us. If you don't disarm [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1166.36s)]
*  you basically something will happen to you and I think that that's where you can actually take [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1171.6399999999999s)]
*  the messaging and play up the fears the Iranians have rather than play down. Also it's interesting [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1176.76s)]
*  the bulk of the American military debate at least in the open source domain is A something about [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1182.6000000000001s)]
*  something much smaller about force protection against bases and consulates and embassies in [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1189.0800000000002s)]
*  the region or it's about preventing the closure of the Strait of Hormuz so it's about either [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1194.52s)]
*  hardening a base or deterrence or it's about a decapitation strike but actually the area where [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfoK4Wy4QfE&t=1199.0800000000002s)]
