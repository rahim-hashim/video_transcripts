# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Lisa Daftari (Jul. 2)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds)
*  Good morning. It's Wednesday, July 2nd. The multi-front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=0.0s)]
*  635 days old. I'm your host, FDD Senior Research Analyst Natalie Econo filling in for Jonathan [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Schanzer. It's his birthday today, so we're giving him a little break. Welcome back to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=29.0s)]
*  the FDD Morning Brief. Those of you who've seen FDD Morning Brief episodes hosted by [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=33.56s)]
*  yours truly know that I watch Qatar like a hawk. So before I tell you who today's guest [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  is, I can't help myself from taking a little detour. Guess who won an International Peace [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=42.92s)]
*  Award yesterday? Yup, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, the Prime Minister of Qatar, the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  same Qatar that sponsors Hamas. Can't make this stuff up. While you're chewing on that, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=53.16s)]
*  let me introduce you to today's guest. Lisa Daftari is an award-winning investigative [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=58.84s)]
*  journalist and editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk, a platform at the crossroads of foreign [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=63.24s)]
*  policy and quality journalism. Yesterday, John and Lisa caught up to unpack the aftermath [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=67.12s)]
*  of the 12-day war, focusing on its impact on Iranians both inside and outside the country. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=71.88000000000001s)]
*  Will Iran's people finally rise against their oppressive rulers, or will the weakened but [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=77.28s)]
*  determined regime find a way to regroup? Stay tuned for that conversation coming your way [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=80.84s)]
*  shortly. The doors of diplomacy will never slam shut. That's what Iran's foreign minister [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=85.08s)]
*  told CBS News. He was commenting on the possibility of resuming nuclear talks with the United [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=91.12s)]
*  States, but slap that phrase on a t-shirt and sell it to Amir al-Thani because boy, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=96.22s)]
*  are those words that Qatar lives by. War in Gaza? Qatar is on the case. How about between [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine? Qatar is ready to assist. Heck, Qatar just mediated a peace agreement [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But back to Iran. The spokesperson [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=110.6s)]
*  for Qatar's foreign ministry said that the Qataris are in daily contact with all parties [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  involved in securing a broader, stronger nuclear deal. This round-the-clock effort comes on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=119.8s)]
*  the heels of the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, which was reportedly made possible [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=124.52s)]
*  thanks to Qatar's assistance. Yes, diplomacy is preferable to war. What bothers me is that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=128.4s)]
*  Iran attacked Al Udeid airbase in Qatar and a ceasefire materialized within hours because [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=133.84s)]
*  the Qataris convinced Iran to get on board, which planted a haunting question in my brain. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=138.4s)]
*  If the Qataris turned around and Iran ceasefire within a day or so, why the slog on the Gaza [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=143.28s)]
*  file? I don't know what goes on behind closed doors, but I can't help but think that if [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  the Qataris really wanted a ceasefire in Gaza, they'd make it happen, or at least do more [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  to make it happen. John said it, I've said it, and I'll say it again. Qatar needs to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=156.32s)]
*  start feeling some pressure. Full stop. Now for your headlines. Headline one. President [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=160.56s)]
*  Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions on Syria. My golly, he did it. Back in May, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=166.72s)]
*  President Trump said that he planned to lift the sanctions to, quote, give the Syrian people [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=172.56s)]
*  a chance at greatness, a promise made, a promise kept, as the White House announced yesterday. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=176.12s)]
*  To be sure, sanctions on Bashar al-Assad and his cronies remain in place. So do sanctions [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=181.46s)]
*  on drug traffickers and human rights abusers, but otherwise consider the Syria sanctions [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=185.28s)]
*  program canceled. That means easing restrictions on foreign assistance and relaxing export [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=189.44s)]
*  controls on certain goods. Trump's executive order also directs the secretary of state to review [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=194.9s)]
*  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's designation as a foreign terrorist organization and interim Syrian [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=199.18s)]
*  president Ahmad al-Shara's designation as a specially designated global terrorist. This is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=204.66000000000003s)]
*  when your regular host, Jonathan Schanzer, would remind you that al-Shara used to be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  a jihadi known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. Talk about a character arc. Headline two. Iranian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=212.5s)]
*  threats against Donald Trump and his administration keep on coming. Last week it was a fatwa, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  this week it's cyber war. Iranian hackers are threatening to release a trove of emails [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=223.5s)]
*  they stole from Trump's associates, including White House Chief of Staff Suzy Wiles and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=227.98s)]
*  Trump lawyer Lindsey Hagan. The hackers identify themselves simply as Robert. In online chants [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=231.82s)]
*  with Reuters, Robert said they've got 100 gigabytes of emails that they're considering [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=237.54s)]
*  selling. The hackers didn't specify what exactly is in those emails or who they might sell [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=241.7s)]
*  them to. This is an example of what the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=245.74s)]
*  described as a sneer campaign designed to damage President Trump, discredit American [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=250.78s)]
*  officials and divide the American people. It's propaganda for the digital age. And headline [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=255.1s)]
*  three. While we're on the topic of suspicious Iranian activity, Danish authorities arrested [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=260.46s)]
*  a man suspected of collecting intel on Jewish targets in Germany. Authorities identified [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=265.54s)]
*  the suspect as Ali S. He was arrested last week and is awaiting extradition to Germany. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=270.7s)]
*  Yesterday, German prosecutors said they believe Mr. S. spied on specific sites in individuals [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  in Berlin, including scoping out three properties last month. Yes, this was all likely in preparation [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  for a terrorist attack. And yes, prosecutors believe that Ali S. was working for Iranian [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=286.86s)]
*  intelligence services, perhaps even the IRGC CUDS force. It's no secret that the Islamic [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=291.18s)]
*  Republic is a threat and that includes to the Iranian people. Since the war between [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=296.38s)]
*  Iran and Israel erupted, Iranian authorities have arrested hundreds of people and executed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=300.3s)]
*  at least six accused of spying for Israel. The regime is setting up checkpoints, promoting [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=304.7s)]
*  harsher punishments and planning to establish special courts to handle suspected traitors. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=309.02s)]
*  This is a repressive regime doing its repressive thing. And that's why the FDD team has long [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=313.5s)]
*  said that maximum pressure must come with maximum support for the Iranian people. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, it's time to press play on that pre-recorded conversation between John and Lisa Doftari, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=325.18s)]
*  editor in chief of the Foreign Desk. So sit back, relax and have a listen. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  Welcome to the program, Lisa Doftari. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=334.86s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  Great to have you here. I want to talk to you a little bit today about what's going on in Iran [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=340.38s)]
*  and maybe the Iranian diaspora. So first, I mean, so you're a Farsi speaker and you track what's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=345.42s)]
*  going on in country. So maybe just tell us a little bit about what the media is saying, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=352.7s)]
*  first and foremost, the state-run media, how are they casting what just happened? I mean, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=359.97999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump just dropped the midnight hammer on the Islamic Republic. The Israelis were [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=366.38s)]
*  flying with total impunity over the skies of Iran for 12 days. And yet they're spinning this as a win, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=371.82s)]
*  are they? Well, that is from the Islamic Republic Handbook. This is what they have done for 46 years. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=378.46s)]
*  Now remember, this is the regime that came into power 46 years ago and automatically put the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=384.22s)]
*  people of Iran into the Iran-Iraq war to have a win. So this is exactly what they have done [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  time and time again. They spin the narrative, they flex their muscles, and they try to bring [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=396.22s)]
*  the people to rally around the flag over a military win when in fact the people now have [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=401.26000000000005s)]
*  obviously understood what is going on. They've looked under the hood for 46 years. We've seen an [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=407.98s)]
*  evolution of the Iranian people that most people don't talk about. I won't even go back 46 years, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=412.86s)]
*  but in 2005 I did a documentary on regime change and I was invited to show that in Congress. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  I didn't have the full support of the Iranian people when I talked about sanctions, when I wrote [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  about the JCPOA in 2015, the Iran nuclear deal, that being a bad idea. I mean, people called me [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  batanfurush, which actually means you're a traitor, you're actually a sellout to your people. Why? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=435.82s)]
*  Because the nuclear program would be a source of national pride. So we have seen this evolution [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=440.38s)]
*  and I think that really started in 2009 with the green revolution where they came out onto the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=446.78s)]
*  streets. They're like fraudulent election, fraudulent election, fraudulent regime. Oh, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=451.9s)]
*  that feels good. And then all of a sudden we're seeing this coming of age. From 2009 you see [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=456.86s)]
*  this protests among people every time they rise up, whether it's over the price of eggs or over [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=463.74s)]
*  the price of bread and then there's the bazaaris and the truck drivers and the teachers. Every time [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=468.38s)]
*  they come out this has gotten more and more expansive and it's gotten deeper and deeper. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=474.46s)]
*  So you're seeing protests in clerical cities, you're seeing disenchantment among all types of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=479.42s)]
*  the ethnic groups inside Iran, all the religious groups inside Iran, all the different socio-economic [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=484.62s)]
*  brackets inside Iran. So to bring us to this moment, the regime is saying one thing and the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=489.5s)]
*  people obviously 92 million. It's very hard to generalize but the majority of people inside [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=494.7s)]
*  Iran are freedom seeking. That might mean different things to different people but they're on the same [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=501.18s)]
*  page about wanting a better future for the people of Iran. Okay, so we're seeing this disparity and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=505.74s)]
*  I think that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned. Let the regime continue to put out messages that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=512.22s)]
*  just don't resonate with the people and you know you begin to see more of that friction emerge. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=517.74s)]
*  We're only a couple weeks out from the Islamic Republic's defeat. What have you seen from the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=523.58s)]
*  diaspora of which you're a part? What is the diaspora doing right now to try to encourage [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=529.98s)]
*  change? I mean we hear about you know groups like NUFTI and we've had NUFTI folks come on this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=536.3000000000001s)]
*  program. We've had other leaders from the diaspora movement, different ways, writers, intellectuals, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  and you know and the like. Is there a consistent message or is it just down with the dictator? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=547.74s)]
*  Great, great question. There's also been a coming of age among the diaspora right? So for 46 years [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=553.6600000000001s)]
*  let's say let's talk about the last 15. The question has always been we talk about regime [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=559.5s)]
*  change but who's going to take over? Who's going to be at the helm? Who's going to organize? Who's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=564.46s)]
*  going to lead and who's going to be the face or the new leader of Iran? And even that has been a [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=568.38s)]
*  lot of work among the diaspora to quiet the lobbies that are pro-regime. The ones who have access to [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=573.98s)]
*  the White House, the ones who have gone in and influenced Iran policy in Washington DC. It's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=579.66s)]
*  crazy for people the average person to think that there are operatives of the Islamic Republic inside [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=585.42s)]
*  Washington affecting how our government deals with Iran and that has been the case in the Obama and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=591.18s)]
*  Biden White Houses. And we're trying to silence those voices and actually let the people's voices [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=596.54s)]
*  be heard. So obviously you talked about NUFTI. NUFTI was very well connected to Reza Pahlavi, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=602.9399999999999s)]
*  the exiled prince of Iran. His voice has been heard the loudest. He's meeting with foreign [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=608.78s)]
*  leaders. He's getting his message out there. I actually had the honor of interviewing him here [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=614.38s)]
*  in LA at a global technology summit that talked about the future or the potential of a future [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=619.5s)]
*  democratic Iran and what kinds of economic opportunity that would unleash onto the region [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  and the world. That's the message that they're trying to get out there. A democratic free Iran [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=631.66s)]
*  will benefit everyone. And I think that's really the talking point that the diaspora as well as the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=637.18s)]
*  people inside Iran have really tried to get out there. There's no reason for this regime to stay [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=642.8599999999999s)]
*  in place. It doesn't really benefit anyone. The other thing I want to talk about is this disparity [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=648.2199999999999s)]
*  that you talked about. That right now there's kind of a, I don't want to say resentment. Let's just [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=651.8199999999999s)]
*  take that with a grain of salt because we're on media and we're limited for time. That where people [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=658.06s)]
*  outside Iran are like, regime change, regime change, come on onto the streets. And the people [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=663.34s)]
*  of Iran are like, wait, how, when, what? There's darkness. We don't have electricity. We don't [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=667.34s)]
*  have the internet. We can't organize. And at the same time, you're telling us to come out on the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=672.3000000000001s)]
*  streets. We don't have weapons. And because of that, we're kind of at a place where the people [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=676.22s)]
*  of Iran want regime change. People outside Iran are telling them to make regime change, but they [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=682.46s)]
*  really don't have any way of doing that at this moment. Okay. So that's a tough nut to crack. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=688.3s)]
*  You mentioned the pro-regime voices here in the United States. And by the way, it's not just in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=695.74s)]
*  the US, right? I mean, we're aware of pro-regime voices across Europe, networks that we just saw [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=701.9s)]
*  recently dismantled in places like Sweden. But talk to us, and you don't need to name names if [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=707.74s)]
*  you don't want to, but if you do, we're very happy to have you drop some bombs. But I mean, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=713.26s)]
*  what do you think their influence looks like right now? I mean, how much sway do they have [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=719.98s)]
*  after the regime just got shellacked by the Israelis and then by the United States? What kind [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=726.06s)]
*  of message can they possibly deliver right now that would buttress this regime in its time of [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=732.7s)]
*  near collapse? Right. They're hanging on by a thread. And it's so obvious because they are [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=739.26s)]
*  resorting to these thug tactics, just like we saw inside Iran, right? The besiege, they have the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=743.3399999999999s)]
*  equivalent on the streets of Europe, on the streets of Washington, DC. We've seen so many of these [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=748.06s)]
*  pro-monarchists protesting in front of the consulate, and then you have them being beaten up by [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=753.02s)]
*  these pro-regime thugs. So they have their operatives everywhere, and this is part of their [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=758.14s)]
*  political warfare. And we've known that for years, and I think a lot of others, particularly in [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=762.78s)]
*  Washington, DC and other places, leadership is catching on to this influence campaign that is [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=770.3s)]
*  being launched by the Islamic Republic and others. I would say it exponentially diminished with the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=775.5799999999999s)]
*  Women Life Freedom Movement. That movement was very, very pivotal for the Iranian diaspora, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=780.6999999999999s)]
*  as well as the Iranians inside Iran, because it was a topic. It was about a woman, a 22-year-old [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  Kurdish-Iranian woman who had gotten beaten to death for wearing her hijab too lax, showing some [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=792.54s)]
*  hair, that was able to bring people onto the same page, regardless of their political party or [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=797.3399999999999s)]
*  their religious affiliation, left, right, center. This is something that could get everybody on the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=802.2199999999999s)]
*  same page. As of then, these lobbies, these voices got drowned out because who can argue with such a [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=806.78s)]
*  small, small ask of freedom to show your hair, to wear what you want to wear, to kiss who you want [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=815.5s)]
*  to kiss on the streets of Tehran. I think that became a very important blip in this long [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=821.82s)]
*  timeline of the Iranian people really wanting to claim their freedom. I think it's going to be [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=829.58s)]
*  very difficult to, while we're at an impasse, it's very difficult to move forward with regime change. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=834.5400000000001s)]
*  It's very difficult to now go back and have any sort of credibility for this regime, especially [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=840.62s)]
*  here in the diaspora. Okay. You've mentioned regime change a few times. I've got to say, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=845.34s)]
*  it's a dirty term in Washington. Oh, it is. We don't talk about regime change, right, because [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=851.26s)]
*  things went really sideways in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. We don't try to engineer new [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=856.62s)]
*  regimes because that just ends in disaster. We spend money. We lose soldiers, blood and treasure, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  as they say. We saw Donald Trump come out and say, Miga, make Iran great again, which I love, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=869.8199999999999s)]
*  and I need to get a hat. No one is selling them yet, which is really driving me crazy. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=877.1s)]
*  Maybe we should do that. I think there's some money in it. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=881.26s)]
*  Other than Trump and his make Iran great again statement, and maybe a little bit from the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=886.94s)]
*  Israelis, is there any Western countries, is there any responsible actor out there calling for this? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=891.58s)]
*  Because I do think that's important. The Iranian people still need to hear from world leaders. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=899.1s)]
*  Other than the crown prince, and we know he delivered that famous statement now from Paris [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=905.9000000000001s)]
*  shortly after Midnight Hammer, I just haven't seen much. What do you make of all that? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=914.1400000000001s)]
*  John, I'm sure you've read my op-ed. A few weeks before the war, I wrote an op-ed that said, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=921.5s)]
*  not all regime changes are created equal. That was exactly that. The opening paragraph is that [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=926.62s)]
*  we have this PTSD here in the West, particularly in the Republican Party, about regime change, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=930.54s)]
*  because they've always failed. Why would this one be any different? Especially when we would [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  be creating some sort of vacuum, because we don't know who would take over. It's not like we really [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=939.18s)]
*  have, other than Reza Pahlavi, who lives in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., to import him as a [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=942.78s)]
*  leader, we don't really have a slam dunk kind of transition to a new government inside Iran. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=948.86s)]
*  Why would this be any different? Look, Iran is completely different. You have a completely [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=955.9s)]
*  different, unified, freedom-seeking population. You have an economy that can open up into the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=959.82s)]
*  world. There's many, many talking points to be made. But to your point, it's not a popular topic [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=968.86s)]
*  and it's not something that people think ... We are trained now as foreign policy experts and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=973.34s)]
*  analysts, whatever it is, to fix rather than to change. I think that, obviously, the history [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=980.7s)]
*  speaks for itself there. With regards to Reza Pahlavi, he has an effort to do that, to tour [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=986.54s)]
*  and to speak to different leaders, for them to understand that the people inside Iran do not [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=995.26s)]
*  match up with its government and how, like I said, all the different ways in which a free and secular, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1000.38s)]
*  democratic Iran would benefit the world. It would benefit the ... Look, Europeans are obviously [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1006.3s)]
*  benefiting from the Islamic Republic. There's no elephant in the room. Let's call it out. Why [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1011.02s)]
*  change the government when we're benefiting from it? Well, there would be more benefit, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1015.34s)]
*  and that's what he's trying to get out there to Washington, to Europe, to whomever else will listen. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1019.5s)]
*  All right. Last question for you before we let you go. Just capitulation or surrender by the regime, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1025.3400000000001s)]
*  we're not going to see it. I think it's highly unlikely. Having people come out into the streets [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1032.78s)]
*  without the weapons, without the communication, without all the tools that you mentioned earlier, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1037.82s)]
*  also doesn't seem likely. What does seem possible to me, and I'm just curious to hear what you think [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1041.9s)]
*  about this scenario, is that you have internal tumult, that there are people within the regime [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1048.22s)]
*  that understand that this has been a disaster. This has been a four decades experiment that has [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1054.14s)]
*  failed. Do you think that it's possible right now that we see either mid-level clerics or mid-level [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1060.94s)]
*  IRGC, somebody come out and just shiv the supreme leader, so to speak? Not necessarily, literally, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1067.66s)]
*  but figuratively, undermine the supreme leader and bring this thing down. Do you think that that's [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1076.94s)]
*  what we should be betting on right now? Do you think that's where the U.S. government should be [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1084.5400000000002s)]
*  putting its primary efforts? As difficult as it may seem, I think this has been the biggest chance [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1087.8200000000002s)]
*  the Iranian people have ever had for regime change, obviously for the many reasons that you just stated, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1094.3s)]
*  but the difficult, the challenging part about this regime is that it is laterally and horizontally [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1098.78s)]
*  fortified itself, right? So we're dealing with a regime that is sadistic, not suicidal. I don't [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1106.22s)]
*  know if many people in the West understand that. I think it's a very, very important point when [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  you're dealing with this kind of enemy, but the number one, and I've said this many times, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1114.8600000000001s)]
*  number one Achilles heel of this regime, that's why you see all the propaganda inside Iran, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1119.18s)]
*  they're trying to get an ally among the Iranian people. Their biggest enemy is not the United [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1123.42s)]
*  States, it's not Israel, it's not the U.N., obviously. It's inside Iran. The fact that the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1127.66s)]
*  people could potentially rise up is what keeps the mullahs up at night, and I think for that reason [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1132.6200000000001s)]
*  the crackdowns will be more brutal. It's going to be very, very difficult, but what we may see, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1140.38s)]
*  and we've seen a bit of right now, and I know that the Palaavi team is working on creating [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1145.02s)]
*  communications channels to actually really reinforce this more, is that you see defection [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1150.22s)]
*  among the military and police class, and once you start seeing that, that's where the real cracks [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1155.74s)]
*  begin, and let me tell you one thing that I think the Iranian people are incredibly brave, but they're [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1160.38s)]
*  not stupid. They're not going to rise up, they're not going to defect when they know that they can [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1165.82s)]
*  be hanged for it. They will, if they see that there's potential, they have support from outside, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1169.9s)]
*  from inside. What happens at the podium is extremely important to that rhetoric, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1175.98s)]
*  Donald Trump's rhetoric in supporting regime change, incredibly important to give them that [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1180.38s)]
*  hope, to give them that optimism to say if we do defect, if we do rise up, if we do come out onto [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1185.82s)]
*  the streets and risk our lives and send our children out there, that there's actually a [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1190.46s)]
*  chance to get our country back. All right, we're going to leave it there. Really interesting stuff. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1194.06s)]
*  Thank you, Lisa Daftari, for joining us this morning on the FDD Morning Brief. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1199.02s)]

*  and exporting terrorist ideology. The focus now must be on empowering Iranians to envision a [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1218.94s)]
*  future where their country is a force for good rather than a global threat. Meanwhile, my colleague [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf2duBA7yds&t=1223.42s)]
