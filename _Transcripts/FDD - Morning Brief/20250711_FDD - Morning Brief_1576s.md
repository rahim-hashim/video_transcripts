# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Meir Javedanfar (Jul. 11)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc)
*  Good morning. It's Friday, July 11th. The multi front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=0.0s)]
*  645 days old. I'm your host Jonathan Chanzer. Welcome back yet again to the FDD morning brief. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=24.52s)]
*  The Houthis are still in the news after the Iran Bacteria group attacked two ships in recent days [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=31.8s)]
*  in the Red Sea region. The group also fired a missile at Israel yesterday. In other words, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=37.56s)]
*  the group is still a menace to the Middle East. Some say this should be Israel's problem to clean [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=42.84s)]
*  up. Israel says no, the US should get back in there and finish off this radical group of goat [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=47.64s)]
*  herders, but perhaps do it with a wider coalition of Arabs and Europeans. I tend to agree, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=53.64s)]
*  but getting the buy-in is not going to be easy. Let's see whether the new realities of the Middle [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=59.4s)]
*  East bring about new willing partners. Today's guest is Israeli Iran expert Mayor Javad Danfar. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=64.44s)]
*  He co-authored a biography of former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=72.36s)]
*  also known in the United States as Ahmadinejad. And he has taught courses on Iranian politics [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=77.0s)]
*  for over a decade. We'll get his take on the 12-day war and the state of the regime in Iran [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=83.32s)]
*  in just a few minutes, so stick around for that conversation. Should be fascinating. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  Reports and rumors continue to swirl about yet another hostage deal between Hamas and Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  And I got to tell you, as much as I welcome the safe return of every hostage, I really don't like [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=97.8s)]
*  how this one is shaping up. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told hostage [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  families that under the terms of this deal, which would last for 60 days, Hamas, not Israel, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=107.96s)]
*  will decide which hostages get released. But wait, it gets worse. Bibi says that Israel has agreed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  to begin talks for a permanent ceasefire once the negotiations begin. In essence, this means Hamas [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  would end the conflict on its own terms. Yes, that means Hamas would be allowed to remain in power. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=125.72s)]
*  And that, as my ancestors would say, is a shanda. And if that sounds bad, just wait. There's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=131.56s)]
*  more. Hamas has also stated that it won't accept an IDF partial withdrawal from Gaza. The terror [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=137.8s)]
*  group is demanding that Israel exit the Strip completely. That includes the Philadelphia, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=143.24s)]
*  Nitzarim, and Morad corridors. These are positions that the Israelis previously vowed to hold. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=148.12s)]
*  It's not clear to me if Israel has accepted all these terms, but there are big asks here from a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  terror group that got its took as handed to it over the course of these last 645 days. It all [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  comes down to the hostages, folks. The Israelis have to play by Hamas rules if they want to bring [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=165.32s)]
*  them all home. And that explains how the region's most powerful military appears prepared to end [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=170.2s)]
*  the war without a clear and decisive win. Now for your headlines. Headline one, the Trump [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=176.04s)]
*  administration continues to escalate its maximum pressure campaign against Iran. Here's the latest. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  The US Treasury Department issued a second round of sanctions targeting Iran's shadow banking [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=188.68s)]
*  network, which is just as opaque as it sounds. The IRGC Quds Force leverages this network of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=193.4s)]
*  front companies to facilitate the sale of oil. It's an illicit business network that has generated [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=199.32s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars for the regime to use on its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=205.0s)]
*  Well, at least they did before Israel destroyed the vast majority of those programs. Treasury [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=209.88s)]
*  sanctioned 22 companies. Most of them are located in Hong Kong. I would expect that from China, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=215.0s)]
*  but get a load of this. A handful are in Turkey and the UAE, the United Arab Emirates. These guys [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  are supposed to be allies. Iran has used these companies to access the international financial [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  system and facilitate its illegal exports. It's good to see the Trump administration doing what [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=232.12s)]
*  it can to strangle the regime as it reels from its military defeat just a few weeks ago. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  Headline two, while we're on sanctions, guess who else got slapped with sanctions in recent days? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=244.44s)]
*  Francesca Albanese. She's the UN special rapporteur for the so-called occupied [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=250.04s)]
*  Palestinian territories and just a downright anti-Semite, if I do say so myself. On Wednesday, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Albanese for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  pushing the International Criminal Court to investigate, arrest, or prosecute American and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=267.0s)]
*  Israeli citizens and businesses. Albanese is, well, she's a vicious clown. She's an utterly [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=272.36s)]
*  unserious person who has spent years spewing anti-Semitic hate, bashing the West, and supporting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=278.84s)]
*  terrorists. Last week, Albanese accused 60 companies and organizations of helping Israel [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=284.28s)]
*  carry out a genocide. Her word, not mine, in Gaza. A third of those companies and organizations are [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=289.56s)]
*  based, wait for it, in the United States. Think Microsoft, Google, and Airbnb. Apparently, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  Albanese sent threatening letters to dozens of companies around the world and recommended [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  that the ICC investigate and prosecute their executives. There's a lesson here, folks. Don't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=307.0s)]
*  mess with the Donald when it comes to American businesses. Don't even try it. Oh, and for those [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=312.52s)]
*  interested, check out my Twitter feed this morning. Al Jazeera and Hamas are defending [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=318.44s)]
*  Albanese on social media this morning. That should tell you just about all you need to know. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=323.96s)]
*  Headline three, Hamas tried to abduct an Israeli soldier. The incident occurred in Khan Yunis. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=329.96s)]
*  According to the IDF, Hamas gunmen popped out of a tunnel, those tunnels, man, and they attacked a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=335.24s)]
*  group of Israeli soldiers. During their attack, the terrorist attempted to kidnap a 25-year-old [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=340.6s)]
*  reservist, but unfortunately killed him as he fought back. Israeli forces subsequently thwarted [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=345.48s)]
*  Hamas's attempt to snatch his body. This kidnapping could have had real significance. It's sick stuff, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=350.52s)]
*  actually. The terror group wanted to add another Israeli to their roster of hostages, dead or alive. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=356.04s)]
*  That would amount to real leverage for the group during these ceasefire talks. There are already [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=362.52s)]
*  50 hostages that are being negotiated over, and that would have been something that would have [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  been a, let's say, a feather in their cap as the negotiations began. The death of this soldier was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  a tragedy, but the Israelis obviously see it as good news that his body was not taken to Gaza. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=377.24s)]
*  His family can now lay him to rest and mourn him properly. All right, it's time for my interview [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=382.2s)]
*  with Mayor Java Danfar. I've watched him on Israeli news channels. He's a lecturer at Reichmann [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=388.76s)]
*  University, and he can go deep on Iran. So let's bring him onto the show right now to do exactly that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=393.56s)]
*  Welcome to the program, Mayor Java Danfar. Thank you, Jonathan. Nice to be here. Great to see you. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=402.2s)]
*  It's been a minute. First, let's talk about the supreme leader. This 80-something-year-old guy [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=407.64s)]
*  who spent a lot of time underground during that 12-day war has finally come out from his bowl, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=416.2s)]
*  and I guess he's seen his shadow, as we say. And he has some choice messages for the United States [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=422.28s)]
*  and Israel and the people of Iran. What is the supreme leader, as he calls himself, what is he [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=427.4s)]
*  saying? If I'm not mistaken, his birthday is coming up quite shortly. It has been a very tumultuous [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=433.24s)]
*  time in terms of the damages that the Islamic Republic suffered as a result of this war, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=443.32s)]
*  and also the damage to the image of the supreme leader who disappeared throughout the war, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=452.52s)]
*  and then, unless I'm mistaken, 10 days after it. The fact that this is somebody who has [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=459.32s)]
*  tried to portray himself as a revolutionary, as he calls himself a revolutionary, not a diplomat, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=467.96s)]
*  he said it in 2013, somebody who believes deeply of being involved and leading the fight and then [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=474.12s)]
*  suddenly disappearing like this and going and hiding. This has undermined his image inside the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=481.48s)]
*  Islamic Republic. What I think, Jonathan, has undermined his image even more and has created a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=488.2s)]
*  major crisis is that there is deep divisions within the Islamic Republic. There are people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=496.68s)]
*  who want the system to change, to listen to the people of Iran. They believe that the Islamic [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=504.36s)]
*  Republic alone, without the people of Iran, cannot continue in its current trajectory. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=511.24s)]
*  It needs the support of the people. For that to happen, political prisoners need to be released. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=516.76s)]
*  The IRGC has to let go of the economy. There was even a letter published in Iranian newspapers [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=522.44s)]
*  calling for this by experts. At the same time, there are those who want to continue with the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=529.32s)]
*  same policies as June 12th, which is the same as the status quo, anti basically, to continue with [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=534.44s)]
*  whatever the Islamic Republic was doing before. They feel very threatened because any change [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=541.6400000000001s)]
*  could lead to billions of dollars worth of lost business. But what I know for sure is that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=547.8s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei faces very stark choices. And another factor is that he doesn't like to make [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=553.88s)]
*  decisions. He leaves it till the very last minute. And I think all of these are going to impact him. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=559.88s)]
*  They're going to impact his image in Iran. They're going to impact the future of the Islamic [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=567.9599999999999s)]
*  Republic. And they could even impact the choice of his successor. Fascinating times. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=573.4s)]
*  So I guess the message really is not much of a message at all. This guy seems to have kind of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=580.68s)]
*  shrank in size and in stature over the last several weeks. I guess we're almost coming up on a month [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=585.4s)]
*  now since that war began. That's a fascinating thing to watch. Another really interesting thing [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=593.72s)]
*  for me is we've heard about a senior cleric in the regime issuing a fatwa against Donald Trump [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=599.32s)]
*  and Benjamin Netanyahu. This is an edict calling for their death. Explain the significance of this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=606.12s)]
*  fatwa, if you would, and whether this is something that has any real world consequence or is this [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=612.7600000000001s)]
*  just more bluster from the regime? I think it is bluster. This fatwa is part of this struggle [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  within the Islamic Republic for the future of the Islamic Republic, which I said in my previous [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=625.4s)]
*  comments. There are people who want to make it as difficult as possible for the regime to change [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=631.64s)]
*  direction because they have a lot of money and a lot of positions to lose. But there are people [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=637.0s)]
*  in Iran who are very worried about how people within the regime, how are they going to handle [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=642.92s)]
*  the costs of the war, the reputational costs, and also the massive amount of money Iran needs just [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=648.8399999999999s)]
*  to survive. President Trump has piled on the sanctions, and also Iran has crises that need [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=655.72s)]
*  billions and billions of dollars immediately, such as the electricity shortage, the power cuts in [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=665.72s)]
*  Tehran, sometimes two hours a day, sometimes a couple of days a week in other parts of Iran. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=672.28s)]
*  So this struggle continues, and there are those in Iran who want to sabotage any change in the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=678.6s)]
*  future direction of the Islamic Republic towards a more conciliatory approach towards the West. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=685.24s)]
*  And one of those ways is this fatwa. Okay. I think there are probably some who are saying, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=692.52s)]
*  well, maybe that sets the stage for more war. But then there's Donald Trump, president of the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  United States, who says that Iran wants to actually talk. This is what he said in that press [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=707.48s)]
*  availability with Benjamin Netanyahu the other day, and they were both flanked by their advisors. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=713.24s)]
*  And Trump, I think, mentioned it even more than once, and he seemed to imply that the regime may [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=718.9200000000001s)]
*  want to reach a ceasefire with the United States. I don't think he said Israel, but he did seem to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=722.6800000000001s)]
*  indicate that the regime may want to talk with the U.S. But here's my question, and I've asked [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=729.08s)]
*  this to multiple folks on this show and in other places as well. Can the Islamic Republic of Iran [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=734.0400000000001s)]
*  still be the Islamic Republic if they aren't calling for death to America, if they're talking [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=739.72s)]
*  to the United States, if they're backing down from the United States, can this revolutionary regime [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=744.44s)]
*  still be a revolutionary regime? Can they save face as they do something like this? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=750.6s)]
*  Oh, they can. There were many people against the JCPOA within the Iran nuclear deal [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=756.3599999999999s)]
*  of 2015, and Ayatollah Khamenei still did it. But the question is, Jonathan, he had to compensate [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=762.52s)]
*  them after the nuclear deal. How did he compensate them? By allowing them more influence in Iran's [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=770.28s)]
*  regional policies in Syria and elsewhere. He compensated by making sure that the United [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=776.5999999999999s)]
*  States does not threaten their business interests, so that Western investments don't threaten [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=782.68s)]
*  their business interests. How did he do that? By kidnapping dual... By basically making Iran [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=789.64s)]
*  uninvestable. So kidnapping dual citizens such as Siamak Namazi, by testing two missiles and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=796.92s)]
*  writing on it in Hebrew that Israel should be wiped off the face of the earth. These are the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=804.3599999999999s)]
*  last things you want if you want to attract Western investments. So Khamenei compensated [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=808.52s)]
*  them for the nuclear deal by allowing them to do this. That was in 2015, Jonathan. 2025, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=815.64s)]
*  a war against Israel, which went very badly for the Iranian regime. It's going to be more difficult [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=822.6s)]
*  for the Supreme Leader to compensate them now. And I think this is what makes the domestic struggle [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=828.4399999999999s)]
*  for the future direction of the Islamic Republic, first and foremost, so important, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=835.88s)]
*  so consequential. And also it could be very painful. It could be a very painful struggle [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=842.28s)]
*  within the Iranian regime. I'm not talking about people shooting each other, but difficult, very [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=848.4399999999999s)]
*  difficult decisions will have to be made because if they are not made, then the Islamic Republic is [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=854.12s)]
*  going to be at a point of no return on issues such as inflation and failure to produce energy [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=860.52s)]
*  for Iran's economy. These are just some of the issues. I mean, the list goes on. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=870.52s)]
*  Yeah. And you can tell that the regime is in... It was in bad shape before all of this. But I want [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=875.0s)]
*  to actually just tease out one thing that you just mentioned. Part of what happened after JCPOA is we [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=880.52s)]
*  saw an increase in the regime's support for what we now colloquially call the ring of fire. It meant [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=886.2s)]
*  that it was more money going to the Houthis and to the Shia militias in Iraq and Syria and to Hezbollah [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=894.6s)]
*  and to Hamas. This ring of fire looks like it's pretty weak right now. And I don't see the regime's [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=900.6s)]
*  ability to strengthen them with just more funds. I mean, just even getting the weapons and cash to [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=909.24s)]
*  these entities doesn't seem as feasible. I mean, it's not impossible, but it's much harder now, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=914.84s)]
*  isn't it? Well, Jonathan, the Islamic Republic had what you call the ring of fire for your viewers [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=921.4s)]
*  consisting of missiles, missile bases, rocket bases, and terrorist bases around Israel's border. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=928.76s)]
*  They surrounded Israel on its south-western border with Gaza, Hamas, on its northern border with [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=937.0s)]
*  Hezbollah, north-western border, north-eastern border with Syria, on our western border with the [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=943.88s)]
*  West Bank through support for Hamas and Hezbollah in those areas. And then there was outer periphery [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=950.6s)]
*  members of the ring of fire, which was Iraq and the Houthis. Now the state of Israel has basically [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=957.64s)]
*  taken most of this ring of fire and transferred it from around its borders to around Iran's nuclear [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=965.56s)]
*  sites. Let that sink in for a moment. This is what we are witnessing here. And it's not just the ring [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=973.16s)]
*  of fire, it's also ring of eyes. You know, you have the five eyes, the five countries sharing [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=983.48s)]
*  intelligence, United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Japan, and I think it's New Zealand. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=989.9599999999999s)]
*  But now you have a ring of eyes, Israeli, mostly Israeli eyes, but also American eyes, on Iran's [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=995.96s)]
*  nuclear program, a missile program. This has been a major defeat. And I'm telling you, Jonathan, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1006.36s)]
*  this is one of the reasons we made a mistake. We made a mistake. The Iranian regime was killing [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1012.2s)]
*  Israelis in the 2000s. There was a thousand people killed in the second Intifada. If you look at the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1018.6s)]
*  statistics, I think out of the 94 terror attacks, 66 were carried out by pro-Iran groups such as Hamas [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1027.56s)]
*  and Islami Jihad. We left it too late. The Iranian regime should have paid the direct price for its [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1035.72s)]
*  killing Israelis all these years. We should have done it a long time ago. So they got away for so [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1043.3999999999999s)]
*  long that at the end, they got the hubris. They thought the Israelis would never attack, and we [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1048.84s)]
*  attack. And unbelievable the turn of events. I do agree that had Israel attacked earlier, you [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1054.6799999999998s)]
*  probably wouldn't have suffered the same kind of ballistic missile reprisals that you did. I was [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1062.4399999999998s)]
*  in Israel when that war began. I was there for the first five or six days. And I know it must have [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1070.52s)]
*  been incredibly frightening for many Israelis to endure those attacks. But yeah, had that happened [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1075.72s)]
*  back in 2000, I think the damage would have been far less. The fear would have been far less. Of [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1081.3999999999999s)]
*  course, Israel didn't have Arrow 3 back then to be able to intercept whatever ballistic missiles [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1087.72s)]
*  could have been thrown. But I do think that timing was important here. And I do think that Israel [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1092.2s)]
*  probably pushed things off for a bit. But let me talk about timing of something else. I'd love for [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1098.2s)]
*  you to talk to me about the state of the opposition in Iran. Is there any momentum right now for regime [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1103.0800000000002s)]
*  change? I mean, I guess my question to you is who should we be watching? Are there groups? Are there [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1110.44s)]
*  people that are on your radar? I know you read Farsi, you track what's going on inside Iran. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1115.64s)]
*  What should we be looking at right now as people talk about the potential teetering, if not [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1121.56s)]
*  collapse of this regime? I don't see anything, Jonathan, to be honest with you. What I see is [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1127.72s)]
*  a population, many of whose members were suffering from anxiety before this war, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1135.32s)]
*  because of problems such as inflation, pollution, especially inflation. You know, we live in countries [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1144.28s)]
*  that don't have high inflation. Inflation is a terrible ailment on the economy and also on [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1150.2s)]
*  mental health, because prices are always increasing by 20, 30, 40 percent, but the wages are only [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1157.08s)]
*  increasing by 10 percent. So people living in countries with high inflation are always [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1163.24s)]
*  under stress. Where am I going to find the extra 20 or 30 percent to buy the basic goods, to buy [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  the services? And there was a severe problem before the war. Now it's even worse. Now the war and also [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1175.72s)]
*  the Iranian regime has just kicked out. I saw a number, I have to double check, something like [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1184.68s)]
*  700,000 Afghan refugees from Iran, some of whom were there illegally. That means there's going to [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1189.48s)]
*  be less people willing to work and they worked for low wages. They were exploited. All of these and [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1195.16s)]
*  also the Iranian currency has been falling. A lot of people took their money out of the stock exchange [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1201.16s)]
*  in Tehran. All of this is pushing up inflation even higher. So people are just trying to survive [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1207.0800000000002s)]
*  day to day, Jonathan. People are just trying to survive from today until tomorrow. I don't see [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1212.76s)]
*  anything in terms of any opposition coming together at the moment. The regime is in fact cracking down [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1219.72s)]
*  on opposition in Iran, on political prisoners. There have been quite a few executions. So this is [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1228.28s)]
*  the situation at the moment, but you know, it could explode. It could explode, but it could be, it would [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1236.12s)]
*  be like an earthquake. Right now on the surface, what I see is people just in terrible shape. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1241.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think, and you see the fear, you see the arrests as paranoia grips the country, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1248.1200000000001s)]
*  and you just do get a sense of the desperation of everybody all around. I mean, let me ask you one [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1254.92s)]
*  last question before I let you go. Is it time for Donald Trump or, I don't know, Macron or [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1261.0s)]
*  Starmor or Schulz or whoever to come out and call upon the people to rise up and to bring down the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1267.32s)]
*  regime? Or do you think that that will just lead to more of the same where the West doesn't support [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1275.0s)]
*  the people and the people hang themselves out to dry? I mean, is there messaging that the West [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1280.9199999999998s)]
*  should be formulating right now to try to bring about some of the change that we all dream of in [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1287.56s)]
*  Iran? I think the people who know more about the advantages of regime change and the people who [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1293.8000000000002s)]
*  want regime change more than anybody else are the people of Iran. You can send whatever message [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1302.52s)]
*  we want. We can, of course, say we want to live in peace with them. With this regime is an impediment [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1309.24s)]
*  to the growth of Iran. This regime is a danger and a threat to the security of Iran. This regime has [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1315.3200000000002s)]
*  brought, has enriched its pockets more than anything else. The whole uranium enrichment [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1321.32s)]
*  program is a guise on the wish for the regime to enrich its pockets through sanctions busting, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1327.6399999999999s)]
*  which is true, actually. A lot of people make a lot of money inside the regime through sanctions [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1333.6399999999999s)]
*  and they want Iran to be isolated. I think people know it, Jonathan. They know it. But at the end of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1339.24s)]
*  the day, it's their decision. It's their decision. We can't make it for it and we can't make it for [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1345.32s)]
*  them. I mean, I was only 13 years old when I left Iran, eight months after my Bar Mitzvah. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1351.96s)]
*  But what I can know from there and talking to Iranians, people in democratic countries have [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1361.24s)]
*  no idea about uprisings. Because in our societies, in Israel and the US, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1369.24s)]
*  you go to the protests. God knows how many protests have been here on Kaplan Street [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1375.96s)]
*  against the policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu. Do I worry about being arrested or kicked out of [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1382.44s)]
*  my job or tortured or being put in prison or executed? Of course not. It doesn't even cross [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1387.64s)]
*  my mind. But in Iran, it does. It's a very dangerous business, extremely dangerous business. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1393.48s)]
*  Yeah. A republic of fear. I guess all we can do right now is hope that the people [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1401.96s)]
*  start to organize, do it in a way that feels right to them, or maybe that there are elements [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1408.3600000000001s)]
*  of the regime that maybe try to undermine some of these key pillars that have been so toxic. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1413.16s)]
*  But I do think we are at a fascinating crossroads, a pivotal point in history. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1418.1999999999998s)]
*  I think you've made that clear today. So I want to thank you, Mayor Jeba Dunfar, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1423.08s)]
*  for joining us today on the FDD Morning Brief. Thank you. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1426.6799999999998s)]

*  tens of thousands of missiles, actually. So let's not forget that there is still a chance of conflict [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1464.44s)]
*  in the future. My colleague Ahmed Sharali has a piece in Foreign Policy, great publication [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1469.88s)]
*  about the possibility of peace between Syria and Israel. Ahmed throws a little bit of cold water [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1475.0s)]
*  on what we've been hearing lately. He cautions that an Israeli-Syrian normalization agreement [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1481.8000000000002s)]
*  may not be necessarily that likely, that there could be too many hurdles that Syria's new leaders [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1486.7600000000002s)]

*  provide sustained security assistance for those countries under fire from the axis, and that means [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CpY2CZS0Sc&t=1530.44s)]
