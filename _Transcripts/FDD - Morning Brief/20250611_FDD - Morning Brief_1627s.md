# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Hay Eytan Cohen Yanarocak (Jun. 11)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE)
*  to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. It's Wednesday, June 11th. Multi front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=21.0s)]
*  614 days old. I'm your host, Jonathan Schanzer, coming at you live from Jerusalem. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=25.82s)]
*  Welcome back to the FTD Morning Brief. Well, the Greta thing is over. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=31.58s)]
*  She was deported from Israel as my colleague Jonathan Konrigas quipped. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=35.9s)]
*  She was persona non-Greta. Video of her flight out is circulating on the internet as expected. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=39.9s)]
*  The only thing the climate activist turned keffiyeh wearing, Hamas advocate accomplished, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  and she was drawing more attention to herself. Shocker there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=50.54s)]
*  Today's guest is Haye Etanko Yenarocak, an author and researcher at Tel Aviv University's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=54.54s)]
*  Moshe Dayan Center, who is one of the world's foremost experts on Turkey. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=61.739999999999995s)]
*  I invited him back for a second time on this program. He's a repeat offender, as we call him, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=65.66s)]
*  to discuss Turkey, which has increasingly drawn my attention in recent days and weeks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=70.7s)]
*  We'll talk about why things have gone relatively quiet for Turkey in the headlines, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=75.5s)]
*  but that may not be a sign of inactivity. Maybe Dr. Yenarocak will speak to us a bit about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=79.34s)]
*  Israel too. Tune in for that conversation in just a few minutes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=85.66s)]
*  Reports are swirling that Donald Trump wants Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to end [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=90.62s)]
*  the Gaza war. I've watched the president's words carefully since February. His patience is waning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=95.26s)]
*  First, let me plagiarize myself. Israel has probably reached the point of diminishing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=101.5s)]
*  returns in this war. Hamas is not rebounding from the IDF operations in Gaza anytime soon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=105.74s)]
*  Hamas is not 100% defeated, but in asymmetric urban wars against terrorist enemies, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  that's just not realistic. But this isn't about Hamas anymore. It's about the Trump-Netanyahu [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=117.58s)]
*  dynamic. The two have a long friendship. It was tested when Biden won the 2020 election, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=122.46s)]
*  and Bibi called to congratulate him. Trump took that as a personal affront. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=127.74s)]
*  Never mind whether the argument had merit, Bibi had to make amends. And that paid off when Trump [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=131.9s)]
*  took office. He gave the Israelis freedom of action in the Gaza war. He prioritized the return [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=137.34s)]
*  of the hostages. He kept Hezbollah from regaining power, and he hasn't said a peep as Israel bombed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=142.22s)]
*  Syria and Yemen for that matter. So now there is a little friction when it comes to Gaza, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=147.66s)]
*  and more friction when it comes to the Iran nuclear negotiations. The Israelis want to beat [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=152.3s)]
*  Hamas, and they want to destroy Iran's nuclear program. Trump wants to make deals, and he wants [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  to move on. Those two approaches are not necessarily incompatible, but don't count on Trump to make any [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=161.5s)]
*  effort here. Once again, it's on Bibi to chart the course ahead while maintaining ties with his most [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=167.5s)]
*  important ally. Now for your headlines. Headline one, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=173.66s)]
*  network of sham charities that fund Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  or PFLP. Five Hamas charities were hit with sanctions. So were five individuals associated [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=184.54s)]
*  with those organizations. All 10 targets helped finance Hamas terrorism under the guide of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=190.22s)]
*  humanitarian work. Treasury also designated a sixth sham charity associated with the PFLP. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=195.98s)]
*  One of the sanctions, sanction group is based in Gaza. The others are scattered across the globe. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=202.86s)]
*  One in Turkey, one in Algeria, one in Italy, one in the Netherlands. Turkey and Algeria deserve a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=208.22s)]
*  shout out here. Both are important jurisdictions for Hamas. The PFLP sham charity is called the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=213.34s)]
*  Ademir Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, and it operates out of the West Bank. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=219.66s)]
*  Ademir has been operating out of Harvard as well. That's as recently as 2022. Shocker there. And [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=223.89999999999998s)]
*  yes, in case you're wondering, FDD research helped shine a light on some of these bad actors. So I'm [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=231.01999999999998s)]
*  glad to see Treasury taking action again. Headline two, Israel carried out strikes against Yemen's [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=236.78s)]
*  Hudaydah port. Hudaydah is controlled by the Houthis. The Israeli Navy targeted the port from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=243.18s)]
*  hundreds of kilometers away with long range guided missiles. This is the first time that Israeli [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=248.62s)]
*  naval forces have been involved in this war. Until now, it has been the Air Force taking it to the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=253.5s)]
*  Iran-backed terror group in Yemen. Israel issued evacuation orders prior to the attack. That's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=258.54s)]
*  standard operating procedure for the Israelis. Unfortunately though, Hudaydah is a key entry [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=263.98s)]
*  point for food and aid as well as Iranian weapons. In other words, like all of the other Iranian [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=269.74s)]
*  proxy terror groups, the Houthis exploit civilian infrastructure for terrorism. Headline three, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=274.94s)]
*  some updates from the Lebanese front. Yesterday, the IDF took out two Hezbollah operatives in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=281.58s)]
*  southern Lebanon. Lebanese authorities identified the duo as father and son. According to IDF, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=286.62s)]
*  this wonderful family was moving Hezbollah weapons and surveilling Israeli troops. And yes, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=293.34000000000003s)]
*  both of these activities violate the Lebanon ceasefire agreement that was signed last year. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=298.62s)]
*  Elsewhere in the land of the Cedars, UNIFIL peacekeepers were assaulted yesterday while [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=304.22s)]
*  conducting a patrol with Lebanese armed forces. A group of Lebanese civilians pelted them with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=309.18s)]
*  stones, although it's suspected they may have been Hezbollahis in plain clothes. Anywho, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=314.14s)]
*  UNIFIL may not be in Lebanon much longer. The organization's bloated mandate is soon up for a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=320.54s)]
*  vote and the United States is preparing to spike it. I'm all for that. Lots of other headlines to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=326.22s)]
*  track, including the European slapping sanctions on Itamar Benkavir and Bitzal El Smotrich, two [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=333.58000000000004s)]
*  right-wing politicians in Israel. Meanwhile, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee is now rejecting any [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=339.18s)]
*  discussion of a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria. Something tells me that Israeli [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=344.14000000000004s)]
*  settlements are storming back into the headlines. Keep an eye peeled for that in coming episodes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=349.1s)]
*  All right, now for that interview with Khay Etan Cohen Yanadirog of Tel Aviv University. We're [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=355.42s)]
*  going to talk about Turkey and maybe a couple of other few things, so let's dive right in. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=361.02s)]
*  Welcome to the program Khay Etan Cohen Yanadirog. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=370.7s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me, dear Jonathan. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=374.94s)]
*  Thank you and sorry I keep butchering your name. It's not easy, but I'm working on my Turkish. I [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=377.74s)]
*  promise I'm getting better. Practice makes perfect. You're doing great. Yes, exactly. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=381.98s)]
*  Practice makes perfect. All right, I want to just ask, can we talk about Israeli politics for a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=386.14000000000004s)]
*  minute? I mean, you live here and maybe you can tell me if this country is going to elections and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=390.38s)]
*  if it is going to elections, why? Okay, first of all, I would like to highlight that I'm an expert [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=396.3s)]
*  on Turkey and now I'm going to answer this question as an Israeli ordinary citizen. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=402.86s)]
*  I think, yes, we are marching to very important days. Unfortunately, our political system is [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  suffering from this chronic instability. As you know, unfortunately in Israel, it's like a national [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=417.74s)]
*  sport. We are going to elections every couple of years, but during this war, the coalition, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=425.9s)]
*  really did its best in order to survive. But now, since the ultra-orthodox religious parties [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=434.78s)]
*  are insisting on not giving up on their demands regarding the enlistment law, which requires every [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=443.34s)]
*  Israeli citizen to serve in the Israeli defense forces. Well, for those who are not familiar with [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=452.38s)]
*  the current situation, the ultra-orthodox Haridis are not serving in the army if they are saying [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=460.78s)]
*  that they would like to study the Bible in the religious schools. These are called yeshivas, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=470.06s)]
*  but the problematic nature is not all the Haridim are studying the Bible. And some of them, despite [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=480.14s)]
*  the fact that they are not studying the Bible, they are not recruited to the Israeli army. And [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=489.18s)]
*  this is an open bleeding wound of the Israeli society because it is creating an equality. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=495.66s)]
*  If we are talking about a burden, and that burden unfortunately became heavier during this last [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=505.1s)]
*  two years because of this war that was imposed upon us. Israel did not initiate this war. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=513.26s)]
*  This war started with Hamas's brutality against the Israeli citizens. They kidnapped our citizens [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=521.5s)]
*  also still. Unfortunately, our citizens are kept as hostages in the dungeons of Gaza. And this is [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=528.38s)]
*  making things much more worse and much more complicated. So from the Israeli perspective, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=539.74s)]
*  I'm a secular, you know, slash traditionalist Jew who is living in Israel, born and raised in Turkey. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=548.62s)]
*  I believe that every Israeli citizen should be enlisted to the army. We all have to serve [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=556.14s)]
*  for the IDF. We should pay taxes. We must do all of these obligations to safeguard our only state [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=563.0200000000001s)]
*  in the entire history. So I think this is, you know, in my perspective, this is intolerable [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=572.62s)]
*  if the current government will not be able to persuade the Haridim to share this burden, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  even in a symbolic manner, which would be understood as a kind of, you know, like a starting [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=589.5s)]
*  point. Maybe today we will not have a revolution, but we have to internalize something. There is [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=597.5s)]
*  something very important happened here. Nothing will be the same again, not in Israel's foreign [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  policy, but also in the Israeli domestic politics. This was a tectonic change, the October the 7th. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=613.66s)]
*  So this cannot go as nothing happened. IDF needs more manpower. And if the Haridim will be able to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=621.5799999999999s)]
*  provide us more manpower. So, you know, we have lots of reservist soldiers. And I see where it's [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=631.9s)]
*  all going. And I think it's interesting, Chai, that the religious Zionists, right, the not ultra [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=640.3s)]
*  Orthodox, but the, as they call them, the kippahs, the knitted kippah wearing religious Israelis, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=648.62s)]
*  many of whom are settlers, but many of whom live in other parts of Israel, they're also, I think, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=655.0999999999999s)]
*  starting to express that same concern. And I do think that this is a societal shift that I think [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=661.5799999999999s)]
*  you're right. It's a change that's going to have to happen. And let me ask you another question. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=667.42s)]
*  It is inevitable. This is inevitable. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=671.9s)]
*  I think so too. And by the way, I mean, I think there's going to be questions, obviously, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=674.54s)]
*  about the Arab sector and others as well. But you know what, one thing at a time. In the meantime, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=678.2199999999999s)]
*  I do want to ask you also about where you think things are going in Gaza. I mean, I've made the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=683.9s)]
*  argument that I think that the IDF has achieved most of its objectives when it comes to Hamas. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=690.3s)]
*  Set aside the hostages for a moment. I know that's a gaping wound for Israelis. I know it's a [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=695.26s)]
*  continued challenge. But from a military perspective, I mean, can we argue any more [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=700.46s)]
*  that Hamas poses a real threat to Israel? I mean, I think this is sort of, I think this is what [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=705.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is now telling Bibi Netanyahu. Okay. So first of all, despite the fact that you [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=711.34s)]
*  mentioned the hostages that I have to put them aside. Yes, now I will put them aside. But [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=719.26s)]
*  I just wanted to clarify that they are here and here. And I'm not ignoring this reality. Okay. But [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=725.9s)]
*  if I'm focusing on this Gaza matter from the tactical and strategic perspective, yes, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  Israel managed to eliminate, you know, the most important, the most important figures [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=740.7s)]
*  of the Gaza's Hamas's terrorist leadership. Yes, we've done a fantastic job on that. Yes. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=749.26s)]
*  However, I think the current government sees the current political situation in the world arena [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=756.54s)]
*  as a historical opportunity. We do not have a president like Donald Trump in every five years [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=765.82s)]
*  in the White House. Therefore, since we are already inside Gaza, and we have such a friendly [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=774.7s)]
*  president when you compare with other candidates of the potential democratic candidates, right? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=784.22s)]
*  So from the Israeli point of view, from the Israeli government's point of view, what I [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=791.9s)]
*  understand is the war must continue to dismantle Hamas's rocket launch ability. Only a few days [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  ago, they again launched these rockets to Ashkelon, to Ashdod, to Gaza envelope area. This [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=809.9s)]
*  ability should be eradicated. And until these people will be turned from a phase of launching [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=818.78s)]
*  rockets to throwing stones, in my opinion, this war should continue. This is a historical opportunity. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=829.26s)]
*  And Israel should do its best to maximize its interests. From my perspective, my personal [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=837.42s)]
*  perspective, I'm not interested in occupying Gaza to conquer Gaza and to have the Gaza's land [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=845.98s)]
*  to annex it to the state of Israel. What I am interested in is I want to provide a more secure [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=856.54s)]
*  future for my daughter as a father. I don't want her to run to the shelters. Yeah. I think everybody [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=866.46s)]
*  understands that. And I think the big question right now is just how much longer can and should [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=873.74s)]
*  this go on knowing that there's not much more that can be achieved without spilling more Israeli [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=880.46s)]
*  blood, spilling more Palestinian blood. I think these are the questions that are starting to come [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=888.86s)]
*  up and that even Donald Trump, who's been a very good friend to Israel, apparently is asking those [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=893.1800000000001s)]
*  questions. But I don't know if that's going to be solved anytime soon. And I think that when we look [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=898.3s)]
*  at people like you in Israel that still support the war and you come from not a religious [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=903.34s)]
*  perspective, not a secular Israeli, an academic, and you still support the war, I think that speaks [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=911.6600000000001s)]
*  volumes. And I thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. I know this is not why I brought you on [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=919.6600000000001s)]
*  today, but here's why I did bring you on. I want to talk Turkey for a few minutes here. I want to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=924.46s)]
*  talk about Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He's been a little quiet lately. He's not calling for a war [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=929.26s)]
*  with Israel, but he is still a major patron of Hamas. And we probably saw the treasury even [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=934.86s)]
*  sanctioned a charity in Turkey the other day, Filistin Vakfi. So what is happening here with [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=941.26s)]
*  Erdogan and Hamas? Well, we are unfortunately seeing a very symbiotic relationship and ideological [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=946.7s)]
*  relationship before the war. If we were all skeptical after the war, you know, due to Erdogan's [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=954.54s)]
*  very clear statements, he's calling Hamas as a freedom fighters organization from the Israeli [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=962.9399999999999s)]
*  perspective. Of course, this is something not tolerable. This is not acceptable. And we are [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=969.42s)]
*  also seeing that also the Turkish foreign ministry, the minister himself and the head of the [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=975.74s)]
*  Turkish intelligence agency, they are having routine meetings with their Hamas counterparts. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=981.98s)]
*  And we are seeing a very close relationship in every opportunity. Turkey is trying to provide [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=993.6600000000001s)]
*  legitimacy to Hamas. And at the same time, on the same opportunity, they are also [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1001.6600000000001s)]
*  trying to delegitimize the state of Israel. Recently, they called Israel as a terrorist [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1009.1s)]
*  state right after Greta's selfish ship incident, right? The Turkish foreign ministry, this is [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1014.22s)]
*  their daily routine almost. You can log on to their website and you can see how much condemnations [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1023.34s)]
*  they issue against the state of Israel and compare it with the other states. You're going to find out [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1032.78s)]
*  that it's a daily routine of the Turkish foreign ministry. It's like a national sport there. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1037.42s)]
*  So we are seeing that there is a very, on every occasion, they are trying to raise the voice [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1044.3000000000002s)]
*  of Hamas, the Turkish directorate of communications, which is functioning as a propaganda [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1055.5800000000002s)]
*  machine for Mr. Erdogan, headed by Fahrettin Altun. Recently, they organized an event [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1063.98s)]
*  to raise the voice of Palestine, slash Hamas. They used a map, they used the map of Israel [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1072.46s)]
*  as a map of Palestine. They put it as an exclamation mark, but luckily, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1082.22s)]
*  it's very fascinating that they chose a map that included the Golan Heights as well. So I really [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1092.54s)]
*  much appreciate them for their sensitivity for Israel's territorial integrity. So let me move [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1098.54s)]
*  to the Golan Heights and we'll talk about Syria, but in the meantime, I think it's very clear that [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1107.5s)]
*  Turkey is not giving up its role as patron of the terrorist group that launched this war now that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1111.26s)]
*  has taken us more than 600 days. So let's just talk about Syria for a second before we let you go. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1117.82s)]
*  Is Turkey still the main patron there? And if so, what does that mean for Israel? What is Israel [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1124.22s)]
*  thinking about as they watch Turkey gain more control and power just to its northern border? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1130.3799999999999s)]
*  I will provide you two important examples. Last April, the Turkish government decided to [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1137.6599999999999s)]
*  send a very clear message that Turkey will provide all necessary infrastructure [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1147.82s)]
*  assistance for Syria to improve their connection to the internet. And on May, the Turkish [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1154.3799999999999s)]
*  Energy Ministry openly told that they are intending to provide natural gas and electricity to [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1163.34s)]
*  Syria. In the same month, in May, the Syrian government signed a deal with the Qatari UCC [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1172.8600000000001s)]
*  company. The value of this agreement was $7 billion. Two important Turkish companies called [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1186.38s)]
*  Cengiz and Kalyon, which are considered as close associates of Mr. Erdogan, they are also in this [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1197.34s)]
*  consortium. It means that the Turks are there in Syria with all their infrastructure and [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1204.54s)]
*  civilian projects. They are rebuilding the Syria. And also in terms of politics, they are providing [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1213.6599999999999s)]
*  any kind of legitimacy for the Syrian government. In their Antalya diplomacy forum, they [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1223.58s)]
*  invited El-Julani, the new Syrian president, to the city of Antalya. They introduced him to other [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1229.9799999999998s)]
*  statesmen there. This is very important. Also, they introduced him to the CEO of the Bikar. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1240.9399999999998s)]
*  A Bikar company, which is known as the manufacturer of the Bayraktar drones. This is creating a [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1250.94s)]
*  question mark. Long story short, Turkey is also in several locations, made it clear that they want [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1258.94s)]
*  to integrate new military bases in various locations in Syria. And Israel is seeing this as a red line [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1266.46s)]
*  because Israel does not want to see any Turkish deployment in the center of Syria or in southern [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1275.18s)]
*  Syria that would minimize or limit the Israeli capability in the Syrian airspace. Therefore, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1283.0200000000002s)]
*  the two countries are tagging each other as potential threats. I think this is very unfortunate [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1292.38s)]
*  because at the end, both of the states never declared hostilities against each other. But [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1298.7s)]
*  now we have to stick what is going on in the power politics in the region. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1304.06s)]
*  So long story short, when I'm looking at this map, I see that thanks to Azerbaijan, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1309.1799999999998s)]
*  which is a very constructive player in the region, Israel and Turkey managed to open a new dialogue [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1317.02s)]
*  channel hotline. But this creation of this hotline does not mean necessarily that the two countries [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1325.4199999999998s)]
*  acknowledged and adopted their red lines. I think we are very far away from that particular [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1334.06s)]
*  place. The two countries are still challenging each other on the Syrian territory. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1343.18s)]
*  And we'll see what will happen. But if you allow me, I would like to add another important [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1351.5s)]
*  issue here. Last March, the Turkish foreign ministry initiated a very important event in [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1356.38s)]
*  Jordan. They portrayed it as an initiative of Jordanians, but in reality, it is a Turkish [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1366.5400000000002s)]
*  initiative that originated in January. What happened in Jordan in March? The five countries, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1374.22s)]
*  Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Jordan came together and they formed a new organization [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1381.18s)]
*  called the Neighbors of Syria. And they formed together an operational center for military [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1389.3400000000001s)]
*  purposes, command center, we can say, for these five countries. And when they are asked why are [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1403.8200000000002s)]
*  they doing this, they are saying that there is ISIS here. But I'm telling you ISIS is a fig leaf. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1410.14s)]
*  This is an initial attempt of creating of a Sunni Muslim alliance, a military alliance, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1416.22s)]
*  a so-called Sunni Muslim NATO alliance in the Middle East. They are nowadays, they are making [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  their best also to pave the way of Egypt. At the end of the Eid al-Fitr celebrations, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1436.46s)]
*  Erdogan also called Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the Egyptian president, and asked him to coordinate [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1444.46s)]
*  all of his moves in the Middle East. And as far as I know, Syria is also located in the Middle East. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1451.1000000000001s)]
*  So if they will update each other on the same issues, then in the long run, it means that Turkey [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1457.1000000000001s)]
*  is also interested in including Egypt to that particular alliance, which means that it will [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1463.82s)]
*  besiege Israel. It will besiege Israel from the north to the south. This is something that is [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1471.5s)]
*  not well known. I want to thank you for flagging it. We're going to need to leave it there, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1478.1399999999999s)]
*  but I want to thank you, Khay Aytankhonya Nahroujakh, for joining us today. Thank you very much for this [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1482.22s)]

*  All right. That last little bit is worth watching. We'll be following up on that, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1502.06s)]
*  this sort of Middle East NATO alliance that's happening of Sunni states. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1505.9799999999998s)]
*  Meantime, here's what FTD has on tap for you today. My colleague David Daud has a new piece [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1510.1399999999999s)]
*  in FTD's long war journal detailing IDF operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon from June 2nd to June [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1514.06s)]
*  8th as Lebanon's government pledges to disarm the Iran-backed terror group and Israel continues its [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1520.3s)]
*  campaign to weaken it. Here's hoping that the party of God, as they call it, is quickly losing its grip. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1525.1s)]
*  It won't be easy, but I do see some progress. Check out my colleague Tzvi Khan's article in [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1530.7s)]
*  Real Clear World of the Iranian regime's execution of a 41-year-old man accused of spying for Israel. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSQ6YwwMbbE&t=1535.8999999999999s)]
