# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Cliff May (Jun. 9)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8)
*  Good morning. It's Monday and it is June 9th. Multi-front war in the Middle East is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=0.0s)]
*  612 days old. I'm your host Jonathan Schanzer. Welcome back yet again to the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=24.62s)]
*  FTD Morning Brief. A potential bombshell yesterday out of Gaza, Israeli Channel [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=30.380000000000003s)]
*  12 reports that documents found during IDF operations in Gaza show close [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=34.94s)]
*  cooperation between Qatar and Hamas to thwart Donald Trump's first-term peace [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=39.82s)]
*  plan between Israel and the Palestinians, including his push for normalization [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=45.32s)]
*  between Arab states and Israel. Bear in mind that this was the signature [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=50.54s)]
*  Middle East foreign policy for Trump, so it's a fair bet that he would not be [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=54.54s)]
*  pleased to hear this. The Channel 12 report also says the documents [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=58.14s)]
*  revealed that Qatar helped Hamas carry out the 10-7 slaughter that dragged the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=61.82s)]
*  entire region into war. We're gonna need to get a full translation of those [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=66.1s)]
*  documents and try to validate them, but if any of this pans out, could be [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=70.18s)]
*  important. Nobody could ever accuse us here at the FTD Morning Brief of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=74.38s)]
*  ignoring the Middle East. This program was literally born out of the war in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=78.66s)]
*  Gaza, and our plan is to continue chronicling this war until it ends. But [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=82.17999999999999s)]
*  today we're shifting gears a bit to talk about another conflict, the one [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=86.66s)]
*  Russia is fighting against Ukraine, and it's the right time to do so. Lots [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=89.94s)]
*  going on and not all bad news for a change. So we've invited FTD's founder [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=94.42s)]
*  and president, Cliff May, on the program to help us break it all down. We're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  gonna touch on the Middle East too, so stick around. That conversation is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=104.1s)]
*  coming up in just a few shakes of a Siberian huskies tale. Israeli forces [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=107.58s)]
*  found the body of Hamas leader Mohammed Sinwar in a tunnel under a Gaza hospital [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=113.06s)]
*  yesterday. This was a huge milestone in the war. First, let's remember that while [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=117.42s)]
*  his brother Yahya Sinwar was the mastermind of this war, it was Mohammed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=121.98s)]
*  who was in the field coordinating with commanders. Now he's dead. And guess what? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=125.9s)]
*  When I look at the list of Hamas leaders at the start of this war, 95% of them are [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=130.38s)]
*  dead too. The IDF's battlefield achievements are now undeniable. Dare I [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=135.26s)]
*  say it? Israel appears to have won. I know the remaining hostages haven't been [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=139.94s)]
*  returned, and I know Hamas is still recruiting fighters who were stealing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=144.82s)]
*  aid and killing IDF soldiers. This means that tactically the war is not over. But [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  continued massive ground operations? I'm not sure they're going to accomplish [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  much strategically at this point. The deaths of both Sinwar brothers, along [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=157.42s)]
*  with all the other damage that Hamas has incurred, tells me that it's time for [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=162.14s)]
*  Israel to at least reassess the trajectory of this war. I don't mean a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  full withdrawal, but can Israel continue to operate in Gaza the way it operates [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=170.38s)]
*  in Lebanon or Syria or Judea and Samaria? I realize that it's easy for me to say [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=174.5s)]
*  this here in Washington. I have the luxury of analyzing this rationally [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=179.22s)]
*  from afar, but I think I'm seeing things for what they are. Hamas is toast, burnt [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=182.77999999999997s)]
*  toast, and the threat it can pose to Israel is likely negligible for years and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=187.9s)]
*  years to come. Now for your headlines. Headline one, Iranian intelligence [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=192.78s)]
*  agencies say they've acquired a cache of sensitive Israeli documents. Some of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=197.82s)]
*  documents may be related to Israel's nuclear facilities. Others may be about [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=203.1s)]
*  Israeli defense plans. Tehran says it obtained thousands of documents, images, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=207.18s)]
*  and videos through a covert intelligence operation that reportedly involved two [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=212.02s)]
*  Israeli intermediaries. This feels like a much less meaningful parallel to the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=216.1s)]
*  2018 operation when Mossad agents boosted Iran's entire nuclear archive [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=220.7s)]
*  and then took it all out of the country right under the nose of the regime. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=226.42s)]
*  Iranian media named the Israeli agents as Roy Mizrahi and Almog Attias, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=230.1s)]
*  Israeli authorities, arrested both men last month on suspicion of spying for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=235.54s)]
*  Iran, but there's a lot we don't know here. The regime has provided [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=240.26s)]
*  approximately zero evidence of what they say they stole, and Israel hasn't [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=243.42s)]
*  commented on the potential breach. We're going to keep tracking this and report [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  back in the days and weeks ahead. Headline two, Al-Qaeda in Yemen is back [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=252.98s)]
*  in the spotlight. Over the weekend, the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=257.94s)]
*  Peninsula, or AQAP, burst onto the scene with a 30-minute speech calling for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  lone wolf attacks against Egyptian, Jordanian, Gulf leaders. Footage of this [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=267.14s)]
*  speech that circulated online showed images of President Donald Trump, Vice [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=271.38s)]
*  President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=276.02s)]
*  Hegsath, and even Elon Musk. I guess it's a little out of date. Safe to say that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=281.02s)]
*  AQAP wants our guys dead too. Al-Qaeda's presence in Yemen goes back decades. I [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=285.85999999999996s)]
*  actually visited Yemen in 2003 to research this exact group. That was at [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=291.46s)]
*  the height of what we once called the War on Terror. That war continues to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=297.02s)]
*  this day, even if we don't say it out loud. The group's leader, Sad bin Atif [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=300.94s)]
*  al-Awlaki, has a six million US dollar bounty on his head, and I'm guessing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=305.3s)]
*  there is a US Reaper drone with his name on it circling right now in the skies [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=311.5s)]
*  over Yemen. By the by, you know who's historically funded AQAP? The Qataris. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=316.26s)]
*  Just saying. Headline three, the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, Unifil, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=322.34s)]
*  may soon be a thing of the past. Yesterday, reports surfaced that the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=327.54s)]
*  Trump administration has decided not to renew Unifil's mandate. The UN Security [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  Council will vote on the mandate in August, and the US appears poised to axe [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  the peacekeeping force with its nay vote. The Israelis reportedly know about this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=341.42s)]
*  and are on board with the plan. This all makes perfect sense. Unifil has existed [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=346.42s)]
*  since 1978. It's supposed to keep the peace in South Lebanon, but it's been a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=350.74s)]
*  clown show. Unifil stood idle for decades as Hizballah entrenched itself in South [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=355.38s)]
*  Lebanon. Meanwhile, the US has been footing the annual bill, which is north [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  of 100 million bucks to keep Unifil afloat. But now with the Lebanese [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=364.3s)]
*  government coordinating with the Israeli government through a US mechanism, it [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=368.7s)]
*  looks like things are going just fine without the UN in the fight to dispant [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=372.5s)]
*  all his ballah. A John Grisham ending in the works here, folks. His ballat is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=376.21999999999997s)]
*  getting shellacked and the UN is getting pushed out. Can't ask for much [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=380.26s)]
*  more. Oh, and yes, I'm following the ship of fools. The Thunberg Titanic, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=384.06s)]
*  the vanity project of the purported climate activist, Bern Kaffee, wearing [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=390.54s)]
*  Greta Thunberg, is somewhere out there in the Med. What a stupid time to be [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=394.98s)]
*  alive. The Swedish-born proponent of Hamas seemed to believe that Israel was [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=399.94s)]
*  jamming her vessel's radar yesterday. Overnight, she released a video claiming [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=404.58s)]
*  she was, quote, kidnapped by Israeli forces. The Israelis have apparently [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=408.54s)]
*  boarded the ship, which they are now calling a selfie yacht. That's quite [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=412.54s)]
*  good. And they note that the ship is carrying a mere half truckload worth of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=416.14000000000004s)]
*  aid, not enough to feed more than a couple of dozen Gazans. It would be [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=420.66s)]
*  funny if it wasn't sad. Someone get that Swedish meatball out of the region ASAP [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=425.54s)]
*  before she does something even more stupid. I have always said this. This [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=430.88s)]
*  conflict brings out the worst in everyone. All right, it's time to welcome [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=435.26s)]
*  FTD's fearless leader, Cliff May, to help us dissect the latest out of Russia [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=440.54s)]
*  and maybe some of the others from what we call the axis of aggressors. So [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=444.14s)]
*  let's dive right in. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=450.02s)]
*  Welcome to the program, Cliff May. Good morning, John Schanzer. All right. All [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=454.46s)]
*  right. Let's kick things off a bit with some good news. Tell us about some of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=458.62s)]
*  these remarkable things that Ukraine has been able to pull off against Russia in [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=462.86s)]
*  recent weeks and what do they mean? Well, most importantly was what we call [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=467.26s)]
*  what they call Operation Spiderweb. This was this ended up as Russia's worst [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=471.09999999999997s)]
*  single day loss of aircraft since World War Two and more specifically since [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=476.98s)]
*  Hitler broke his non aggression treaty with Stalin and launched Operation [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=483.9s)]
*  Barbarossa against the Soviet Union. And that was on June 22nd, 1941, just in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=490.46s)]
*  case you want to mark the occasion with some warm Russian vodka and pickles. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=497.94s)]
*  What they did, you know, millions of dollars of strategic aircraft were [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=503.18s)]
*  destroyed without a single Ukrainian plane being even endangered. They used [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=508.97999999999996s)]
*  drones for this. These drones popped out of the backs of trucks. The truck [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=515.38s)]
*  drivers didn't know what they even had. This was it was an amazing operation. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=519.86s)]
*  The only thing you can compare it to is kind of the grim beepers that the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=524.26s)]
*  Israelis did. There were actually, as far as we know, no Ukrainians even in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=528.1s)]
*  Russia for this. They went a lot of these you should know these strategic [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=532.98s)]
*  aircraft, which can carry nuclear weapons, but were also being used to bomb [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=538.1s)]
*  Ukrainian cities, residential neighborhoods, hospitals, schools. Some of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=541.98s)]
*  them were thousands of miles away in Siberia. They were not protected. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  They were not. They were simply out on the tarmac. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=551.6199999999999s)]
*  Nobody understood that the Ukrainians could have this capability. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=554.0999999999999s)]
*  After all, we thought that Zelensky had no cards to play. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=558.3s)]
*  Well, it turns out he had at least one card way up his sleeve that he did play. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=561.42s)]
*  So this destroyed an important part of Russia's strategic abilities, weakening [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=565.78s)]
*  America's second worst adversary. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=571.9799999999999s)]
*  And by the way, it taught a lesson, not least to Americans. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=574.5s)]
*  Our strategic aircraft are also very much unprotected. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=577.98s)]
*  And if you with the Chinese buying up land, agricultural land and land near [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=582.86s)]
*  military bases and with drones with various software and maybe hardware from [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=587.34s)]
*  China in it, we're in danger, too. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=592.14s)]
*  And that and this lesson needs to be learned by the U.S. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=594.54s)]
*  Lesson learned indeed. I'm sure everybody is internalizing that right now. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=598.5s)]
*  But in the meantime, you can pass the popcorn on the video of those Russian [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=602.34s)]
*  aircraft getting destroyed. That's just some wild stuff. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=607.02s)]
*  Watch that on repeat for a little bit the other day. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  Just sort of giggling. But then there's the bad news, right? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=612.1s)]
*  I mean, let's zoom out and assess the war more broadly. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=615.74s)]
*  Ukraine has lost territory that it's not likely to win back. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=618.5s)]
*  I mean, am I right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=622.42s)]
*  Well, I think that's right. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=624.18s)]
*  Certainly in the short term, certainly in the medium term. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=625.18s)]
*  I don't think so. If you could get a ceasefire. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=627.78s)]
*  And that's what President Trump says he wants is a ceasefire. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=630.1s)]
*  And I think you could get it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=633.0600000000001s)]
*  But he has to put real pressure on Putin, which he's threatened to do, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=634.3000000000001s)]
*  but has not yet done. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=638.42s)]
*  If he were to do that, what would happen? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=640.34s)]
*  Well, a ceasefire and a frozen conflict would mean that about [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=642.26s)]
*  probably 19 percent of Ukrainian territory at this point is occupied by Russia. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=647.14s)]
*  But keep in mind, in 2023, it was 18 percent. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=651.74s)]
*  That's a lot of bodies paving that additional one percent that Russia has gotten. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=656.34s)]
*  So, yes, we're talking about the eastern and southern sections of Ukraine. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=661.02s)]
*  The eastern sections actually have been in an insurgency [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=666.34s)]
*  that was precipitated by the Russians as early as 2014, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  the same year that Russia invaded, occupied and annexed Crimea. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=674.1s)]
*  So, yes, they would lose that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=678.4200000000001s)]
*  But am I saying it's permanent? Not necessarily. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=680.02s)]
*  Keep in mind, I don't I don't imagine that after Putin passes from this earthly coil, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=682.46s)]
*  the succession will be particularly smooth to who to the to the next leader. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=689.7s)]
*  If there is a chaotic succession, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=694.86s)]
*  it is possible that Ukraine could then take back its territory at that point. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=698.5s)]
*  That's what I'm seeing. If not, you have a frozen conflict. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=703.22s)]
*  What does a frozen conflict look like? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  We know the conflict in North and between North and South Korea. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=707.78s)]
*  Represents that that war never ended. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=712.26s)]
*  It's just an armistice, a truce since when? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=714.7s)]
*  Since 1953, 75 years ago. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=717.6600000000001s)]
*  Also this month, in case you want to mark that occasion as well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=721.1s)]
*  Lots of occasions to mark it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of things to celebrate and joy. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=726.82s)]
*  And, you know, that's why it's such fun working with you, John. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=729.38s)]
*  We can. Oh, my goodness. Wow. I didn't. I had no idea. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=732.02s)]
*  All right. Well, let's talk about some of Putin's other moves [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=735.58s)]
*  because he's not yet left this earthly coil, as you call it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=739.62s)]
*  You're a poet, even at eight forty two in the morning here. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=743.94s)]
*  I'm thinking about Moldova and Serbia and Finland and Norway, to name a few. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=748.18s)]
*  Putin is not done yet, is he? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=753.46s)]
*  No. And personally, I'm also be honest, in response to the Operation Spiderweb, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=756.18s)]
*  hundreds of drones and ballistic missiles have been raining down on Ukraine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=761.86s)]
*  Putin was obviously very angry about this, very humiliated. All of that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=766.74s)]
*  What else is going on? Well, you heard from the prime minister of Moldova. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=771.26s)]
*  He believes that there are going to be troops on his border very soon. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=774.46s)]
*  And there is already a section of Moldova, the eastern section. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=777.46s)]
*  It's called Transnistria. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=781.42s)]
*  And the Transnistria is essentially already a Russian colony, has been since 1992. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=783.74s)]
*  You also have forces, Russian forces threatening Finland, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=790.94s)]
*  threatening Norway. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=795.94s)]
*  I had dinner the night with an ambassador for one of the Baltic countries. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=799.0600000000001s)]
*  He said that the Russians are hanging up so that you don't know. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=803.58s)]
*  So that one of the Baltic countries can see them. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=808.4200000000001s)]
*  Signs that say Russia's borders stretch to the horizon. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=811.46s)]
*  Russia is signaling Putin is signaling very clearly [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=816.86s)]
*  that his ambitions are not limited to Ukraine. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=820.3000000000001s)]
*  If he gets Ukraine, then he wants to challenge NATO. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=824.78s)]
*  And that's something we need to think about, because there are only two possibilities here. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  One is that say he that's just suppose he decides to go into Lithuania. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=832.2199999999999s)]
*  Why I say that, I've said that for a long time. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=837.26s)]
*  I've written about that because he has a non-contiguous province [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=839.2199999999999s)]
*  known as Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and he might want a land bridge [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=842.66s)]
*  just as he wants a land bridge to Crimea. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=846.6999999999999s)]
*  Are we the you are Americans? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=849.42s)]
*  Are Americans going to fight for a road through Lithuania to Kaliningrad? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=851.62s)]
*  Because if they don't, NATO is toast, to use your analogy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=856.54s)]
*  And if NATO if NATO ends as an alliance, what happens to other American alliances? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=861.1s)]
*  And don't you think Xi Jinping has this on his mind? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=866.82s)]
*  He would think that Putin is really doing a good day's work [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=869.9s)]
*  for their no limits alliance if he were to smash NATO. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=873.4200000000001s)]
*  And that's not impossible. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=876.94s)]
*  Well, I take the lesson out of all of this, Cliff, is that what Israel's doing [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=879.1800000000001s)]
*  in Gaza is really just destabilizing the world. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=883.14s)]
*  That's what I take out of it. Right. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=886.98s)]
*  All right. Kidding, of course. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=888.62s)]
*  I mean, I just when you start to hear about all these other things [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=890.1s)]
*  that Putin's doing and you think about the intense coverage of the Gaza conflict [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=892.7s)]
*  alone in our media, it really is illuminating. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=896.7800000000001s)]
*  But OK, getting back to Putin. All right. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=901.5400000000001s)]
*  Now that we understand what's happening on the ground, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=904.1s)]
*  I do want to talk about what's happening in his head. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=906.42s)]
*  You have a good piece coming out soon on a statue of Stalin [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=908.98s)]
*  at a Moscow subway station. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=912.02s)]
*  Tell us why that statue matters. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=914.42s)]
*  That's a statue and it's a it's a it's a big statue. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=916.98s)]
*  Well, it shows it's kind of like socialist realist. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=920.22s)]
*  It shows Stalin. He's under a portrait of Lenin. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=922.62s)]
*  There are all these worshipful, worshipful Russian workers holding up flowers to him. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=925.14s)]
*  It wouldn't be there if Putin didn't approve of it and what it shows. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=929.98s)]
*  And by the way, I did a little research on it and found out there's like [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=932.8199999999999s)]
*  a hundred monuments to Stalin that have been erected since Putin came to power. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=936.1s)]
*  Don't forget the previously in the Khrushchev era, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=941.26s)]
*  there was what's called de-Stalinization. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=944.1s)]
*  Many people recognized who Stalin was and that he was one of the great [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=946.5799999999999s)]
*  tyrants of the 20th century right up there with Mao Zedong and Adolf Hitler. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=950.9399999999999s)]
*  He killed millions and millions of his own people. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=955.18s)]
*  Putin admires Stalin. Why does Putin admire Stalin? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=960.14s)]
*  The quickest way I can tell you is this. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=963.8599999999999s)]
*  After World War, at the end of World War two, two things happened. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=965.8199999999999s)]
*  A number of countries in Europe were liberated by the US. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=968.9799999999999s)]
*  And where the Red Army prevailed, those countries weren't liberated. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=972.2199999999999s)]
*  They went from a Nazi dictatorship to Soviet dictatorship. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=975.26s)]
*  Essentially, it became colonies of the Russian empire. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=979.8199999999999s)]
*  And as I've been saying for years, Putin sees himself as the czar. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=982.9799999999999s)]
*  And his goal is to resurrect, to restore the Russian empire. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=987.3399999999999s)]
*  And bring it back to where it was at its peak. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=991.54s)]
*  And its peak was under Stalin. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=994.66s)]
*  And he also believes that Stalin was right, that, you know, to get things done, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=997.06s)]
*  you have to kill a lot of people. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1000.9s)]
*  You know, his old saying, I'm not sure this is it's been attributed to him, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1002.54s)]
*  is if you want to make omelets, you got to break eggs. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1006.9s)]
*  But somebody then said, so where exactly is the omelet? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1010.26s)]
*  If you look at anyway, he admires Stalin. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1014.1s)]
*  Keep in mind, Xi Jinping admires Stalin always has. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1017.46s)]
*  He is a Stalinist, doesn't mean as a communist, even a Marxist, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1020.98s)]
*  but he's a Stalinist and in a way, in a lot of ways, that's even worse. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1024.46s)]
*  So that's what I'm saying. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1028.42s)]
*  And really what my column tries to make, the point tries to make is [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1029.5s)]
*  President Trump needs to understand what this Stalin statue [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1033.62s)]
*  and the other Stalin monuments and Putin's admiration for Stalin, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1037.8999999999999s)]
*  what that tells us about Putin, which I don't think it's clear [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1042.18s)]
*  that President Trump has understood up to now. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1046.54s)]
*  By the way, others haven't as well going back to George H.W. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1049.26s)]
*  Bush, who looked in his eyes and saw somebody who was trustworthy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1052.82s)]
*  Putin, I don't understand it exactly, but evidently Putin can be rather charming. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1055.8999999999999s)]
*  I guess so. He doesn't really look charming. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1060.06s)]
*  You know, like, I don't know. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1064.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure I see it, but I guess other people do to each their own. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1066.58s)]
*  OK, you know, we had to tie this all back to the Middle East. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1071.06s)]
*  So tell us how is Putin working with Iran? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1074.3799999999999s)]
*  And how does that all tie back to the concept that you forged, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1077.5s)]
*  which is that there is an axis of aggressors out there? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1080.82s)]
*  Yeah, there's an axis of aggressors. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1084.86s)]
*  And what are we talking about? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1087.5s)]
*  We're talking about Beijing, Moscow, Tehran and Pyongyang. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1089.14s)]
*  And Putin is very closely aligned at this point [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1093.74s)]
*  with the Islamic regime in Tehran. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1098.22s)]
*  He's getting drones from them. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1101.78s)]
*  They may be opening a drone factory for him. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1103.94s)]
*  They have military and political cooperation. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1106.62s)]
*  It's really quite, quite remarkable. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1109.18s)]
*  But they but all the members of the axis of aggressors and they're different. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1111.3799999999999s)]
*  One is one is Islamist, one is neo imperialist, one is communist. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1115.06s)]
*  One is the dynastic dictatorship. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1118.58s)]
*  What do they have in common? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1120.4199999999998s)]
*  They want to prevent America from being great again. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1121.58s)]
*  They want to diminish America. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1124.62s)]
*  They want the American led international order. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1126.26s)]
*  I know makes people's eyes rolls to hear that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1128.82s)]
*  But there's always an international order since World War Two. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1131.46s)]
*  The US has let it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1134.74s)]
*  They want that to end and they want a new international order [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1136.26s)]
*  in which they make the rules. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1138.98s)]
*  And and those rules start with the Communist Party of China [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1141.1s)]
*  being the hegemony of Asia, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1147.22s)]
*  Russia being the hegemony of at least Eastern Europe, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1150.34s)]
*  Tehran being the hegemony of the Middle East, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1153.6599999999999s)]
*  North Korea taking over South Korea. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1157.06s)]
*  That's what now they want to go beyond that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1159.5s)]
*  But that that's those are their immediate aims. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1161.1799999999998s)]
*  So Putin has a very close relationship with Tehran. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1164.58s)]
*  And by the way, good relations with Hamas and with all the other Islamists out there. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1168.8999999999999s)]
*  He knows they're not going to bother him, despite the fact that he [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1172.98s)]
*  crushed the Muslims of Chechnya, despite the fact that he has other Muslim [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1175.86s)]
*  colonies with them, what we call the Russian Federation, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1180.3s)]
*  but which is still the Russian empire shrunken, though it is at this point. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1183.26s)]
*  This is a bit this is a dangerous axis and a dangerous alliance. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1188.6599999999999s)]
*  And most importantly, and I think this is very much [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1192.74s)]
*  one of the things FDD wants to communicate, is the US has to understand [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1195.7s)]
*  that there is this axis, that they are waging a Cold War [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1200.02s)]
*  already against the US and we have to strategize and mobilize [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1203.54s)]
*  so that we fight it properly, because you never win a war [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1207.5800000000002s)]
*  if you don't know you're in it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1210.14s)]
*  That's right. That is absolutely right. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1212.22s)]
*  All right. We're going to leave it there. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1213.98s)]
*  I want to thank you, Cliff May, for enlightening us today [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1214.98s)]
*  on Russia on the FDD morning brief. My pleasure. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1218.38s)]
*  All right. Good stuff. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1222.3s)]
*  Here's what FDD has on tap for today. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1226.26s)]
*  My colleague Jonathan Konrikis appeared on the Henrik Beckheim podcast [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1228.3400000000001s)]
*  to discuss the current state of Hamas amidst the ongoing IDF campaign in Gaza. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1232.6200000000001s)]
*  He notes that despite the elimination of tens of thousands of Hamas terrorists, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1237.38s)]
*  the group continues to recruit new trigger happy fighters [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1241.22s)]
*  at times using humanitarian aid that they stole as leverage. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1244.5s)]
*  But it does once again beg the question, are massive military [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1248.6200000000001s)]
*  ops the way for Israel to win? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1251.82s)]
*  In his recent piece for JNS, my colleague Ben Cohen draws attention [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1254.74s)]
*  to the persistent patterns linking all forms of anti-Semitism across history, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1258.1s)]
*  namely two big ones, violence against Jews or the defense of such violence [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1262.54s)]
*  from pogroms that raged throughout Europe over 100 years ago [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1266.78s)]
*  to pro-Hamas protests on college campuses and the recent terrorist attacks [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  against Jews in D.C. and Boulder. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1274.1s)]
*  Benz and Alice is incredibly timely and a little disturbing, too, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1276.06s)]
*  if you don't mind me saying. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1280.1399999999999s)]
*  Finally, my colleague Andrea Stricker writes in the New York Post [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1281.8999999999999s)]
*  about the International Atomic Energy Agency's recent report [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1284.94s)]
*  exposing Iran's secret nuclear activities and its cover up of violations [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1288.82s)]
*  of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, while the IA board of governors plans [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1293.02s)]
*  to seek a resolution formally declaring Iran as noncompliant. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1297.94s)]
*  Andrea emphasizes that this step alone is insufficient. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1302.34s)]
*  The West must act urgently to restore [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1305.5s)]
*  suspended U.N. sanctions on the regime. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1308.34s)]
*  We call that snapback and we're hoping that it does, in fact, snap back. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1310.54s)]
*  That's going to do it for today, folks. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1315.8999999999999s)]
*  Stick a fork in it. We are done. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1318.02s)]
*  If you want more smartness to read, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPVwaCNAC8&t=1320.3799999999999s)]
