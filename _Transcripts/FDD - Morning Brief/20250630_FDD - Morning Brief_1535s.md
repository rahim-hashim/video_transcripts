# FDD Morning Brief | feat. Jonathan Panikoff (Jun. 30)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U)
*  and we'll be right back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. It's Monday, June 30th. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=23.0s)]
*  The multi front war in the Middle East is now 633 days old. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=26.0s)]
*  With longer interviews, we're returning to our regular format. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=29.0s)]
*  So welcome back to the regular FD morning brief. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, the Israeli struggle against Iran is not ending anytime soon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=36.0s)]
*  Sure, the ceasefire is holding, but both sides understand the game. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=40.0s)]
*  There will be future rounds in this fight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=43.0s)]
*  That much we can say for sure. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=46.0s)]
*  In the meantime, the Israelis have unfinished business in Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=48.0s)]
*  They've got 50 hostages still held by Hamas and Iran's proxy, battered as it may be, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=51.0s)]
*  and they're still able to kill 20 Israeli soldiers in recent weeks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=57.0s)]
*  Get ready for an intense international debate about Israel's renewed push to end that war on their terms. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=60.0s)]
*  It's going to be a tough one, and we're going to chronicle it right here on the FD morning brief. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=67.0s)]
*  Today's guest is Jonathan Panikoff, director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=72.0s)]
*  He's got years of experience working in the U.S. intelligence community, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=78.0s)]
*  and this morning is a good time to get his take on the Israeli and American military operations that took place recently in the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=81.0s)]
*  We'll cover that and a bunch more, so stay tuned for that conversation coming your way shortly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=90.0s)]
*  The debate over whether Donald Trump completely obliterated, partially obliterated, or only modestly obliterated Iran's nuclear program is both politicized and asinine. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=96.0s)]
*  There, I said it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=107.0s)]
*  I might need to say it again. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=109.0s)]
*  The nuclear program was already set back by months before Trump dropped those massive ordnance penetrators on Iran's underground nuclear sites. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=111.0s)]
*  The Israelis destroyed everything they could before the B-2s arrived, and that included at least 11 nuclear scientists. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=118.0s)]
*  Then Trump drops the midnight hammer and destroys more of the program. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=125.0s)]
*  Predictably, he boasted about it before the battle damage assessment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=129.0s)]
*  Predictably, his haters want to undermine his claims. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=133.0s)]
*  Predictably, the American news cycle is another dog's breakfast of weak sauce opinions and half-baked facts. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=136.0s)]
*  Want to know what matters here? That Trump was willing to hit Iran, and he says he'll do it again if need be. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=142.0s)]
*  So, the Islamic Republic is scared, justifiably. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=147.0s)]
*  The mullahs sent cash and other assets to Oman because they thought their regime was collapsing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=150.0s)]
*  There's only one thing the regime wants more than the destruction of Israel, and that's to survive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=155.0s)]
*  So, let me say it again. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=160.0s)]
*  The debate over whether Trump completely obliterated, partially obliterated, or only modestly obliterated Iran's nuclear program is both politicized and asinine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=161.0s)]
*  The regime is in survival mode. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=171.0s)]
*  The clerics know they are weak. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=173.0s)]
*  They know the Iranian people hate them, and they are fending off efforts by Israel, the Iranian diaspora, and others to trigger the regime's collapse. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=174.0s)]
*  As my old friend, the late Michael O'Dean used to say, faster, please. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=182.0s)]
*  Now for your headlines. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=187.0s)]
*  Headline one, Hamas issued fresh threats against aid workers in Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=188.0s)]
*  Remember the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=193.0s)]
*  You know, the U.S.-backed aid organization that's been distributing millions of meals to Palestinians in Gaza? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=195.0s)]
*  Well, over the weekend, GHF told Fox News that Hamas is openly targeting GHF team members. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=200.0s)]
*  That means Palestinian aid workers and American security personnel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=207.0s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=211.0s)]
*  Hamas has reportedly placed bounties on the GHF team. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=212.0s)]
*  The Iran Bacteria Group is said to be offering cash rewards to anyone who kills, injures, or otherwise hurts GHF personnel, Americans included. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=216.0s)]
*  Forget the depravity of all this for a minute. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=225.0s)]
*  Just remember one thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=227.0s)]
*  If Hamas loses control of the aid it has been hijacking, it will finally collapse. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=228.0s)]
*  This is desperation, folks, and I hope we're seeing the beginning of the end. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=234.0s)]
*  Headline two, over the last three months, the Shin Bet has arrested over 60 Hamas operatives in the West Bank. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=238.0s)]
*  This is the kind of thing we saw during the second Intifada, folks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=245.0s)]
*  Some eye-popping numbers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=247.0s)]
*  Turns out the Shin Bet has been working with the IDF and the Israeli police to dismantle Hamas infrastructure in the city of Hebron. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=249.0s)]
*  The months-long counterterrorism operation is the largest in the West Bank over the last decade. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=255.0s)]
*  During interrogations, the Shin Bet learned that senior Hamas operatives in Hebron worked to recruit, arm, and train local terrorists to shoot and bomb Israeli targets. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=261.0s)]
*  Many of these Hebron Hamas operatives were formerly imprisoned in Israel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=270.0s)]
*  The Shin Bet then discovered weapons, caches, and ammo, and they even uncovered an underground hideout. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=274.0s)]
*  Israeli authorities rounded up dozens of operatives from 10 different terror cells. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=279.0s)]
*  Thanks to operations like these, violence in Judea and Samaria has been the dog that didn't bark for now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=284.0s)]
*  Headline three, Ireland is weighing legislation to ban imports from Israeli communities in the West Bank. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=290.0s)]
*  Irish Foreign Minister, or rather, Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Simon Harris introduced the bill, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=296.0s)]
*  which is titled, The General Scheme of the Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Prohibition of Importation of Goods Bill. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=301.0s)]
*  That long name is harder on the palate than a plate full of corn brief and cabbage. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=311.0s)]
*  But the acronym, well, it's a little easier to say, but man, it's a doozy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=316.0s)]
*  To quote former Irish Defense Minister, Alan Shatter, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=320.0s)]
*  only Simon Harris and our current government could be so foolish as to create the acronym, PIGS, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=323.0s)]
*  to reference a new law that targets and boycotts Jewish-produced goods. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=330.0s)]
*  Yikes. Anyway, the PIGS bill was approved by the Irish government. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=334.0s)]
*  It's now awaiting committee approval. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=338.0s)]
*  If and when the legislation comes into force, Irish Customs will be able to search, seize, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=340.0s)]
*  and confiscate goods that originate in Judea and Samaria. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=344.0s)]
*  This is a policy that openly aligns Ireland with Hamas and the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=348.0s)]
*  I think that's pretty clear. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=354.0s)]
*  And bonus headline for Iran. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=356.0s)]
*  Iran's grand ayatollah, Makarram Shirazi, issued a fatwa against Donald Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. This won't sit well with the Donald. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=364.0s)]
*  Shirazi is one of the most senior clerics in Iran. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=367.0s)]
*  He ruled that Trump's threats to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei amount to war against Islam. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=369.0s)]
*  That's a quote. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=375.0s)]
*  This isn't Trump's first tussle with the Islamic Republic, though. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=376.0s)]
*  Last year, the U.S. Justice Department revealed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot against our then-president-elect. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=379.0s)]
*  And I think it's fair to say that he hadn't forgotten when he ordered Operation Midnight Hammer. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=385.0s)]
*  I think that was still pretty fresh in his mind. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=390.0s)]
*  Okay, that's it for your headlines. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=392.0s)]
*  It's time to dive in right now to that conversation with Jonathan Panikov of the Atlantic Council. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=395.0s)]
*  Let's welcome him onto the show. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=399.0s)]
*  Welcome to the program, Jonathan Panikov. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=401.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=406.0s)]
*  All right. Looking sharp today. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=408.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=410.0s)]
*  So, folks, if you would just give folks a sense of what you used to do in the intelligence community. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=411.0s)]
*  I know, obviously, there are things that you can't say. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=417.0s)]
*  There are things you'd have to kill me if you told me, blah, blah, blah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=419.0s)]
*  But just by way of brief background, what did you do when you were inside? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=422.0s)]
*  Yeah, so thanks so much for having me. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=426.0s)]
*  Look, the biggest thing that I did is, and probably most prominent, was I was the deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East for almost five years, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=429.0s)]
*  which is a very long title to basically say that I oversaw all of the major reports, analysis that went to the president. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=438.0s)]
*  So anything that was short, like a PDB, I was obligated to review within the Middle East region. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=448.0s)]
*  Anything that was long, such as a national intelligence estimate, I reviewed. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=454.0s)]
*  And then in between, I wrote a lot of things that represented the entirety of the intel community. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=459.0s)]
*  So instead of just CIA or DIA or NSA, we put together reports that were reflecting all of the opinions. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=465.0s)]
*  It made it, I think, much more pragmatic, certainly, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=472.0s)]
*  but I think also a much broader overview of where US assessments were and analysis was on any major Middle East issue. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=476.0s)]
*  Got it. So it sounds like you're sort of the author and editor of Finished Intelligence that would go to the president, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=484.0s)]
*  summed up and neatly packaged for the president to read. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=491.0s)]
*  Amongst other folks. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=495.0s)]
*  Amongst other folks. Got it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=497.0s)]
*  OK, so that makes you particularly well placed to talk about this battle damage assessment. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=499.0s)]
*  So let's talk about that BDA. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=505.0s)]
*  I want to talk about what goes into a BDA, but I also would like to ask you what you assessed happened to Iran's nuclear program [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=508.0s)]
*  based on the various reports that you've been seeing, conflicting reports in some cases, DIA versus CIA versus, I don't know, Pentagon. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=515.0s)]
*  So, yeah, just curious to get your take on what you're seeing right now. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=524.0s)]
*  Look, I think the reality is it's too early to know with any great specificity exactly what was destroyed versus not. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=528.0s)]
*  What was obliterated versus not. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=536.0s)]
*  I think the language here and the rhetoric, as you referred to earlier, that's become politicized, has actually been somewhat unhelpful on both sides of the aisle. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=538.0s)]
*  This shouldn't be a partisan thing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=546.0s)]
*  The reality is that it takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of intelligence work to try and figure out the totality of the picture. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=548.0s)]
*  And that's especially true if you're not going to have folks on the ground, inspectors on the ground like the IAEA or folks from other countries who are representing [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=556.0s)]
*  in experts in nuclear sites, nuclear programs, nuclear weapons. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=565.0s)]
*  I think it's clear the Israelis before the US struck clearly had set back Iran by a significant margin. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=570.0s)]
*  Is that months on their own, years on their own? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=578.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=581.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody realistically knows, but it was a significant amount of time. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=583.0s)]
*  I think when President Trump made the decision to then strike Fordow, which was critical, it only lengthened that timeline. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=587.0s)]
*  I think the challenges and where people are getting confused is, look, there's a reason DIA's initial assessment was low confidence. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=595.0s)]
*  It was literally a day or two in. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=602.0s)]
*  There's no reason it should be higher than that because these things take time. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=605.0s)]
*  My sense is this is going to take probably at best weeks, more likely a couple more months to really get a holistic picture of exactly the totality of damage was done. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=609.0s)]
*  But I'm pretty confident just from what I've been hearing, from folks I've been speaking to, from technical experts, political experts, that you are talking about the program having been significantly set back, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=619.0s)]
*  whether it's a number of months or, frankly, a number of years. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=632.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had Jacob Nagel, former National Security Advisor to Benjamin Netanyahu, come on the program on Friday last week. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=636.0s)]
*  And he was saying that you're not going to get more than five years because five years is pretty much the entire cycle that it would require for the complete resumption from scratch of the nuclear program. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=644.0s)]
*  So realistically, maybe two or three years, maybe less if less damage was done, but still a significant setback to the regime. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=656.0s)]
*  But I do think, again, that a lot of it really has to do with just Donald Trump's will to do this, the Israeli chutzpah to do what they did. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=664.0s)]
*  You get a sense that the regime is licking its wounds. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=672.0s)]
*  But maybe if I could get you to just go off script for just a little bit, the politicization of intelligence is starting to really bother me at this point. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=675.0s)]
*  I mean, we saw it, I mean, years ago during the Obama years, we were we were looking at the way that the Intel community was revising some of its assessments based on the political needs or whims of the president at that time. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=685.0s)]
*  And then things shifted back when you had different people in charge. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=698.0s)]
*  How much are you concerned about the way that intelligence has been politicized in recent years? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=702.0s)]
*  I look, I'm concerned about anybody that politicized intelligence, and I don't think that this is a partisan thing. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=709.0s)]
*  I've been concerned, frankly, about how the Trump administration has done it really. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=714.0s)]
*  It's an issue not on Iran and not on the Middle East. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=718.0s)]
*  I think the way the Trump administration has, frankly, fired the heads of my former office, the National Intelligence Council, I was publicly came out and noted that I thought those two leaders were excellent leaders. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=721.0s)]
*  I was concerned about that. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=733.0s)]
*  I'm equally concerned if there are folks that for political reasons are simply taking the DIA report on the Hill and saying, look, this proves that Trump didn't do anything. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=735.0s)]
*  That's also equally wrong. There should be no politicization in intelligence. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=745.0s)]
*  Intel officers fundamentally have one goal and one goal only. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=749.0s)]
*  And that's to make the best judgments they can with the information that they have. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=753.0s)]
*  And it's not unreasonable for two different analysts looking at the exact same facts to come to two different conclusions. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=758.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean that one of them is acting in a political manner. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=764.0s)]
*  It just means that based on their expertise, they've got different interpretations. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=768.0s)]
*  I think we've got to be a little more open to how Intel really does its job in letting them do the job without political interference. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=772.0s)]
*  Agreed. Agreed indeed. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=780.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=782.0s)]
*  So moving on to the rest of the region, how do you assess what these Israeli and American strikes on Iran, which were both lengthy and significant, will mean for the region? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=783.0s)]
*  Are we going to see the realignment that people are talking about just based on the strikes that were carried out? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=792.0s)]
*  Look, I think it would be silly to not be frankly honest about this and be truthful that the balance of power has shifted significantly away from Iran. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=799.0s)]
*  If you look at where we were almost 18 months ago and say March of 2024, there was a real belief that Iran was ascendant in the region. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=808.0s)]
*  And there's a direct line from October 7th to what happened all through the Israeli strikes. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=816.0s)]
*  But that includes, frankly, a number of decisions by Israel from killings ahead in Syria that started this to killing Haneeh in Tehran, to taking out the air defenses, to obviously diminishing Hezbollah completely. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=822.0s)]
*  All of those steps led to where we are today. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=836.0s)]
*  Hezbollah was designed to be the pointy end of the spear. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=839.0s)]
*  If you had told me two years ago we'd have a war like this and Hezbollah would be nowhere to be seen. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=842.0s)]
*  I honestly tell you, I think you're nuts and don't know what you're talking about. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=847.0s)]
*  But truth be told, that's exactly what happened. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=850.0s)]
*  And that is a reflection of what Israel has done. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=852.0s)]
*  That's going to have an impact going forward. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=855.0s)]
*  And I think that's important. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=858.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's forever. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=859.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that Iran won't try to reconstitute its proxies and partners in the region. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=860.0s)]
*  But it does mean that there's been an opportunity and an opening that I think has been created. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=865.0s)]
*  Now, can Israel take advantage of it? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=870.0s)]
*  Will Arab states take advantage of it? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=873.0s)]
*  I think that's what's a little bit unknown. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=875.0s)]
*  But even when it comes to issues that we've all said for years are huge problems, nuclear proliferation, that too has been significantly undermined. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=877.0s)]
*  We know the Saudis have said if the Iranians got a bomb, they would too. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=886.0s)]
*  If the Saudis had gotten a bomb, I don't think it's unreasonable to believe the Turks, the Emiratis, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=890.0s)]
*  others may have also decided to try to get one. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=894.0s)]
*  The fact that Iran's program has been set back as it has is not just a boon for Israel in removing an immediate existential threat. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=897.0s)]
*  It's frankly a boon for the entirety of the region for nonproliferation. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=905.0s)]
*  And I don't think that's been talked about enough in the entirety of this conversation that we've had over the last, frankly, week or so. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=909.0s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=916.0s)]
*  And I'm glad you point all of that out. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=917.0s)]
*  But let me maybe I don't want to say push back, but I want to probe a little bit more because some say that realignment can't happen without regime change, right? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=919.0s)]
*  That unless the regime is completely destroyed, they're going to keep pushing back and they're going to keep using the terror weapon and they're going to keep maybe trying to build a nuke. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=929.0s)]
*  Maybe not right now, but we could go, you know, we could be back at square one. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=939.0s)]
*  So what do you think about the prospects of regime change at this moment? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=943.0s)]
*  Do you think that change in Iran would mean better days for its people? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=947.0s)]
*  Do you think it would be opening Pandora's box? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=951.0s)]
*  I mean, we hear a lot about this right now. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=954.0s)]
*  And of course, in Washington, we've been taught that regime change is a dirty term, right? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=956.0s)]
*  We're not supposed to talk about it ever since the lessons that we purportedly learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, which were, of course, disasters at the end of the day. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=961.0s)]
*  But does that mean that we should be giving up on this or only leaving it to the Israelis and maybe, I don't know, Azerbaijan and quietly the Gulf states? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=969.0s)]
*  Or should we be leaning into this? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=978.0s)]
*  Look, I think part of the problem is regime change means different things to different people. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=981.0s)]
*  I've been pretty on pretty explicit and on the record that when it comes to say external prompts for regime change in Iran, a country, by the way, two and a half times the size of Texas, I think it's going to be a problem. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=985.0s)]
*  I don't think it's going to lead to where we want it to. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=998.0s)]
*  So in other words, it is really decapitation of the regime leadership. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1000.0s)]
*  I'm very, very skeptical is going to bring the type of Western Democratic reforms that folks are hoping for in Iran that I want to see in Iran in my lifetime, much sooner, frankly, and that the people of Iran deserve. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1005.0s)]
*  But my concern is in Israeli external prompt is much more likely to lead to IRGC a stand. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1019.0s)]
*  I think the bigger question is internal regime change. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1025.0s)]
*  And traditionally, part of the problem is we saw this in the Green Revolution of 20 2009. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1028.0s)]
*  Women like freedom in 2022. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1034.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, regime change is really hard in a place like Iran. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1036.0s)]
*  If somebody was guns to be crude about it, doesn't switch sides. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1040.0s)]
*  That can be the guards that can be the standing army, can be the civil police, who are probably the most likely given how poorly paid they are and how close to the society. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1044.0s)]
*  But you do need somebody with guns generally to switch sides. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1053.0s)]
*  And I think the question is, should the US and many other countries be doing more? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1056.0s)]
*  I think it was a mistake, for instance, to cancel VOA Persia. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1060.0s)]
*  Is that going to laundering down the regime? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1065.0s)]
*  No, not even close. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1067.0s)]
*  But I think there are things that we can do from fostering greater Persian media from the outside to providing VPNs and other networks. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1069.0s)]
*  There are steps, but I do think ultimately it's going to have to come from within the regime. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1079.0s)]
*  Otherwise, I think it's probably not going to be stable. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1084.0s)]
*  And you're more likely to see a military autocracy than the type of Western goal that we're looking for, of some sort of democratic Iran. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1087.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I tend to agree with your assessment. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1096.0s)]
*  I mean, I think for me, the only issue is, or at least what I ask is whether it really matters from the US perspective or from the Israeli perspective or the Western perspective. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1099.0s)]
*  Does it really matter who brings down the regime as long as the regime is brought down, given the grave damage that it has done to the region, the threats that it continues to pose even in its weakened state? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1108.0s)]
*  And I guess we'll have to find out whether any steps are taken. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1118.0s)]
*  But for just a second here, if you could just talk to me about Gaza. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1121.0s)]
*  Do you think that Israel can achieve anything with the surge right now in that war? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1126.0s)]
*  I know we're looking right now at an Israeli military that wants to ramp this up. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1131.0s)]
*  They want to try to deliver that kind of crippling death knell to Hamas. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1135.0s)]
*  Do you think that's possible? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1141.0s)]
*  I think there are certainly more terrorists that can be killed. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1143.0s)]
*  I think there's certainly more leaders that can be killed. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1145.0s)]
*  I think it can certainly have an impact. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1147.0s)]
*  I think the question becomes at what cost? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1150.0s)]
*  I think there's a question of whether there's still significant strategic value left for Israel to go after in Gaza at this point. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1153.0s)]
*  Or are you better off trying to wrap up the operations and move on and get the hostages back in a more conservative way? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1161.0s)]
*  I tend to lean towards the latter. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1170.0s)]
*  I'm skeptical that there's huge strategic assets, but that comes with one big question still. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1173.0s)]
*  I think it's a problem that we're this many months in, 20 months in, and there's still not a clear plan of what comes next. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1179.0s)]
*  And I think asking Israel to leave Gaza without an actual clear plan of what comes next also invites chaos. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1186.0s)]
*  And so, look, this isn't going to be something Israel can do on its own. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1193.0s)]
*  We know Arab states and Western states haven't wanted to actually be involved and step up in this. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1196.0s)]
*  They've been very hesitant. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1200.0s)]
*  But we've also seen plans from the Emiratis and others that have been put on the ground that have been offered that I think we need to be looking at in more detail and actually having the nuance provide. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1202.0s)]
*  And I'm hopeful that behind the scenes we're starting to actually see that happen. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1213.0s)]
*  And so my guess is we'll get to some sort of mix here. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1217.0s)]
*  But we're going to have to wait and see, I think. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1220.0s)]
*  And ultimately, it's going to be a question for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1222.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1227.0s)]
*  And of course, we're watching Netanyahu is getting full backing right now from Donald Trump with his legal issues. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1229.0s)]
*  But I got to say, for me, the big issue from my perspective is just whether the hostages can be released. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1234.0s)]
*  In other words, you stop fighting. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1241.0s)]
*  Can there be movement on the hostage front? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1243.0s)]
*  I think the Israeli perspective has been up until now that only fighting against Hamas will ultimately release these hostages, that it's only military pressure. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1245.0s)]
*  I guess the big question right now is whether political pressure in the wake of Iran's defeat on the battlefield, whether that can actually lead to the release of hostages. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1254.0s)]
*  And I think also from the Israeli perspective, partial deals are just not going to cut it anymore. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1265.0s)]
*  The idea that you could get another 10 people out, you know, alive and dead, this mixture, it's very just I mean, it's really sickening how lives are wielded as cards by Hamas and their patrons. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1269.0s)]
*  But for me, I think the question is stop the fighting. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1284.0s)]
*  But then what? What does political pressure look like? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1287.0s)]
*  And I guess we'll start. We'll find out. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1290.0s)]
*  I've got one last question for you before I let you go real quick. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1293.0s)]
*  We're two weeks out from Midnight Hammer. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1296.0s)]
*  How do you think the anti-American revisionist powers, China and Russia specifically, are looking at the United States and our influence around the region? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1298.0s)]
*  Do you think this was a net positive? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1307.0s)]
*  I do. I think, look, at worst, it was kind of neutral. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1310.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any negative here because I think what it suggested is that despite maybe the public perception of where some of the isolation is doing, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1314.0s)]
*  say within the MAGA movement and Trump party were that no, the US really will intervene if it's in its interest and out of its close allies. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1322.0s)]
*  I think that's I don't know that's going to change Beijing's plans, for instance, in Taiwan long term or the South China Seas. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1330.0s)]
*  But it has to at least give them pause. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1336.0s)]
*  I think for Russia, it's a little bit of a different story. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1338.0s)]
*  And it'll be kind of fascinating how this plays out because of Russia long term with Ukraine really ends up as significantly isolated as Iran at the moment is. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1341.0s)]
*  I think there's going to be a real question of actually does it push them together over the long term? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1351.0s)]
*  Russia has lost huge influence in the region, whether in Syria, it's struggling mightily in Libya. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1356.0s)]
*  Now it's your partner in Iran. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1363.0s)]
*  And I think there's going to be this really interesting dynamic to watch long term. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1365.0s)]
*  Does that mean that Russia actually ends up working more strategically with Iran than even they were planning to and say decides in the coming year or two years to try to give Iran better airspace? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1368.0s)]
*  The S-400 instead of the S-300 help Iran rebuild its ballistic missile program, things of that nature. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1380.0s)]
*  I think we're going to have to watch and see, but it's a dangerous potential. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1387.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to just say if I'm if I'm if I'm one of Russia's clients and I just watched what just happened to their S-300s, I am not buying anything Russian made anytime soon. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1390.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1403.0s)]
*  The Iranians, man, if they want to double down on that, God bless, because I think the Israelis have a clear path to destroying them again. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1404.0s)]
*  I think we could say that with some certainty. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1411.0s)]
*  Anyway, we're going to leave it there. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1414.0s)]
*  I want to thank you, Jonathan Panikov, for joining us today on the FTD Morning Brief. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1415.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1419.0s)]
*  All right, some good perspective there from a former Intel guy. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1423.0s)]
*  Here's what FTD has on tap today. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1426.0s)]
*  My colleague Ben Cohen's column in JNS has one troubling takeaway after the war between Israel and Iran. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1428.0s)]
*  Israeli and U.S. strikes may have exposed the regime's military weaknesses, but Tehran's greatest and deadliest weapon right now is its ability to export terrorism. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1433.0s)]
*  And that weapon is unfortunately still intact. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1442.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, my colleague Craig Singleton's Wall Street Journal op-ed shows how Israeli and U.S. strikes not only weakened Iran, but exposed the gap between China's ambitions and its real power. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1445.0s)]
*  Despite its partnership with Tehran, Beijing did little when its ally was under attack. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1455.0s)]
*  Craig stresses that the U.S. can now leverage this by sanctioning Chinese entities tied to Iran's oil trade and widening the gap between Beijing and Tehran. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1460.0s)]
*  Finally, FTD's Cliff May writing in the Washington Times, assesses Israel's military operations in Iran. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1469.0s)]
*  He also notes that out of all the U.S. leaders, only President Donald Trump took bold, lasting steps to curb Tehran's nuclear threat with implications for Israel's security, America's security, and global stability. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1475.0s)]
*  Kind of hard to argue with that, at least right now. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1488.0s)]
*  Anyway, all right. That's all she wrote for today. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1492.0s)]

*  Until then, we're going to keep tracking those headlines, and it is like drinking out of a fire hose. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1510.0s)]
*  We do it so you don't have to, but we also do it because, well, we're a little obsessed. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1515.0s)]
*  With that, I'm Jonathan Schanzer, signing off for FTD. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3R3OvxML6U&t=1520.0s)]
