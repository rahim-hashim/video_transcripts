Video Description: Israel has launched precision strikes against nuclear and military facilities in Iran — just days after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) formally declared Iran in violation of its nuclear nonproliferation commitments for the first time since 2005.
The Islamic Republic — closer than ever to acquiring a nuclear weapon — had dismissed U.S. diplomatic overtures and accelerated its nuclear program in ways that clearly exceed any plausible civilian use.
What are the implications for regional security and America’s allies? How will these developments affect Iran’s nuclear trajectory? And how might continued escalation shift the strategic balance across the Middle East and beyond?
To deconstruct, Jonathan Schanzer hosts an all-star lineup of experts: RADM (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Conricus, Eyal Hulata, and Mark Dubowitz.

# EMERGENCY SITREP: Israel Strikes Iran (Jun. 13)
**FDD - Morning Brief:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc)
*  A wild night here in Jerusalem where I'm coming to you live right now at around 3 o'clock [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=0.0s)]
*  in the morning, alarms began to sound what first felt like it could have just been a garden variety [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=26.52s)]
*  Houthi attack turned out to be an Israeli attack on a wide variety of targets across Iran. Those [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=31.88s)]
*  attacks are happening until now, hours and hours later, the Israelis have been striking Iranian [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=39.08s)]
*  nuclear targets, Iranian military targets, Iranian personnel. We have a major war in the Middle East. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=46.68s)]
*  The United States has not indicated whether it's directly involved or not. I think we're getting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=53.16s)]
*  some mixed messages there. We're hearing from the Israelis that these attacks could continue for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=57.8s)]
*  more than a week, maybe a few weeks here until the job is done. We're hearing about major setbacks [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  to the Iranian nuclear program. We're hearing about confusion on the streets of Iran. We're looking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  at pictures of apartment buildings that have been attacked by drones and by precision-guided [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  munitions. This is a major turn of events. I'm Jonathan Schanzer, executive director at Foundation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=82.12s)]
*  for Defense of Democracies. We've got a special sit rep for you this morning because the regular [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=88.92s)]
*  morning brief could just not simply handle all of what we are trying to cover. As I said, I'm coming [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=94.36s)]
*  to you live from Jerusalem. We are waiting to find out when we can leave, but in the meantime, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  I want to welcome, I've got three excellent colleagues to help us unpack what's going on here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=105.48s)]
*  I've got retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery from FDD. I've got Eyal Khulata, former national [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=110.52s)]
*  security advisor to Naftali Bennett, Prime Minister Bennett. And we also have Lieutenant [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=116.52s)]
*  Colonel Retired Jonathan Konrykis, all excellent FDD colleagues. I want to welcome you all to this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  program. We have about a half hour here where we want to try to get through a lot of information. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=127.8s)]
*  So I'm going to try to make this as quick as possible with each and every one of you. We may [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=133.56s)]
*  get Mark Dubowitz to join us, our CEO. He may also be able to hop on and talk about some of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=138.76s)]
*  wider impacts as we think about Iran writ large. But first, let me go to Monte. Mark Montgomery, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=145.88s)]
*  you've got years and years of experience in the U.S. military. You've seen your fair share of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=153.16s)]
*  conflict. I want to ask you, how sustainable is this for the Israelis? We're watching them [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=158.28s)]
*  fly a thousand miles to attack these targets, then come back and refuel and reload and do it again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=163.8s)]
*  I'm curious what you think about air defenses. And I'm also wondering what you think about a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  possible U.S. role here. Right now, the messaging coming out of the White House and the Pentagon is, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  well, let's just say it's not clear yet. Monte, over to you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=181.8s)]
*  Monte Thank you. And you know, I would probably wouldn't say we have a major war yet. I think we [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=185.0s)]
*  have an ongoing major campaign by Israel. Whether we have a major war or not is going to depend on [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=189.8s)]
*  how Iran responds to this. If they're smart, we won't have a major war. If they're foolish, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=194.28s)]
*  then this ongoing campaign will be accelerated. As usual, I think the Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, did their homework. You know, they've got a competent campaign plan. They hit the targets [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=206.2s)]
*  that are most likely to not be available a day or two days later into a campaign. They're not, you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=212.92s)]
*  know, the ones that are not fixed. And so and Jonathan can talk to that in a minute. But, you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=219.08s)]
*  know, so I'm not surprised. And look, President Trump was pretty clear. He said, I'm going to work [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=224.28s)]
*  this issue for 60 days with you. Now, historically, when the U.S. gives you a timeline, it's fudgeable. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  When the U.S. gives you a timeline, and the person who's going to hit you is Israel, you probably [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  ought to think the timeline is not fungible. And on day 61, you know, the timeline turned out not [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=237.88000000000002s)]
*  to be fungible. And they were hit. So from my perspective, Israel has domestically produced [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=243.24s)]
*  long-range strike weapons. They have U.S. purchased long-range strike weapons, munitions, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  and then of course they have weapons systems, the F-35, F-15, purchased from the United States. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  Those are the right kind of systems to do a sustained campaign. Israel would not initiate [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=265.72s)]
*  this if they didn't have sufficient munitions to execute the campaign, so I'm confident they do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=271.8s)]
*  They're fortunate they had President Trump in office the last three months in the sense of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=276.04s)]
*  the munitions pipeline has been turned back on. But the kind of munitions used in this were procured [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  several years ago or domestically produced several years ago. These were not [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=286.68s)]
*  an overnight kind of thing. So from my perspective, you know, they've been ready to execute this, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=290.6s)]
*  I think, in their armament stowage facilities. The stuff for Iran was separate from the stuff for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=296.2s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas. Not that it doesn't all go together, but these kind of weapons that penetrate [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=301.4s)]
*  more sophisticated systems at longer ranges, they were especially for Iran. So I'm comfortable that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=307.64s)]
*  the campaign plan will execute properly. What's interesting now is you asked about the response, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=313.4s)]
*  you know, against coming back at them drones, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles. Now we [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  understand Israel's done damage to the ballistic missile program back in October and probably a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=324.44s)]
*  little bit last night. But the reality is Iran started with a lot. We've allowed them to aggregate [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=328.92s)]
*  a lot of ballistic missiles over the years. So these still exist. This is where I think it [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=334.76s)]
*  gets a little touchier. I think on the drones, I don't worry as much. You have US pilots in the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=340.6s)]
*  Middle East who can intercept some on the way over. You have Israeli pilots and both those air forces [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  over that have already demonstrated their ability to successfully engage at a very high percentage [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=351.24s)]
*  rate inbound drones. And then you have a quality point defense system in Iron Dome if there's an [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=357.64s)]
*  actual targeted something of value under target. Cruise and ballistic missiles are harder. And [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=363.88s)]
*  either coming from Iran or coming from the Houthis in Yemen, there's a potential for these hitting. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=370.52s)]
*  There's a potential for it being properly engaged by an Aero system or David sling system or the US [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=376.84s)]
*  THAAD system that's there. And you just don't get a, you don't have a successful consummation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=382.52s)]
*  So there may be cruise and ballistic missiles that hit. Again, I would not overreact to this. This [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  is going to happen. And this is a small consequence of a much larger objective that I know Yalan [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=393.64s)]
*  will talk to as well. So from my perspective, that's where we go. Final thing on the United States. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=401.32s)]
*  Look, do I think the United States supported this with weapon systems? No. I think it may turn out [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=405.96s)]
*  we did, but I doubt it. I think this was, we were informed. We were aware. We were not a participant. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, will we be considered a participant because that F-35 may have had a star David on it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=419.56s)]
*  but it sure looks like it was produced by Lockheed Martin. You bet. And I don't think [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=425.24s)]
*  anyone should have a problem with that. The United States is in the business of supporting [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  democracies under attack from authoritarian regimes. And one thing I want to remind you, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=433.0s)]
*  one country provided, it alleged to start providing Iran with ballistic missiles within [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=437.8s)]
*  the last two weeks, and that was China. So a reminder to ourselves, Israel is not fighting [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=443.24s)]
*  Iran alone. Israel is fighting Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea, just like Ukraine is, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  just like Taiwan is, just like the Republic of Korea is. And the United States needs to stand [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=456.2s)]
*  behind each of these countries. But right now, Israel's in the, in the Borsig. We need to stand [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=460.92s)]
*  behind these countries to fully support them. And that's what I think you're going to slowly [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=466.68s)]
*  hear emerge as President Trump's and his team's description of what happened. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=469.96s)]
*  Yeah. And I think a little bit of a tightrope act right now for the president who doesn't [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=475.08s)]
*  necessarily want to get directly involved. But of course, if the U S did get directly involved, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  it might be able to maybe put a final nail in the coffin, so to speak, for some of those [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=483.88s)]
*  nuclear sites that are borrowed beneath the ground. And maybe I'll get to a all on that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=488.04s)]
*  momentarily. Thank you, Monte. I want to turn to you, Jonathan Konrikis. I want to ask you, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=492.28s)]
*  we've seen a lot of targets. I've been watching Israeli TV most of the day, and the list just [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  keeps growing and growing of what Israel has hit. We're talking about military targets. We're [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=504.52s)]
*  talking about nuclear targets. We're talking about military personnel. We're talking about nuclear [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=510.11999999999995s)]
*  scientists. So talk to us a little bit about what has been hit and what all that means. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=514.76s)]
*  And then I think if you would broaden out for us a little bit, you know, I think one of the fears [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=519.72s)]
*  that Israel had when it was thinking about this plan or some derivation thereof over the last 10 [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=525.0s)]
*  or 15 years was that if and when they attacked, there would be all these Iranian proxies that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=531.0s)]
*  would shower weapons on Israel, making such an attack that much more painful. That's now not [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=536.2s)]
*  happening. So tell us what's going on in the region. I know I've just thrown a lot at you, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=543.1600000000001s)]
*  but give us an update. Yeah. So good morning. Great to be here with esteemed colleagues. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=547.0s)]
*  And I think it's overall quite a positive day. This is just the beginning. And I don't think [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=553.96s)]
*  we've entered the woods yet, let alone out of the woods. But I think that this is a good way to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=560.44s)]
*  start. I'd say that this is probably a strategic surprise of historic dimensions that Israel [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=566.04s)]
*  was able to spring on the Iranian defense establishment. Usually the Iranians are very [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=575.88s)]
*  cunning, very good at the art of deception, very good at negotiations. It appears that Israel, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=582.12s)]
*  my assessment is that Israel and the U.S. lulled the Iranians into a false sense of security. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=589.32s)]
*  And that was one of the enabling factors that allowed Israel to take out more than 20 senior [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=596.2s)]
*  Iranian military officials. And I'm talking about the number ones of most of the armed branches of [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=602.68s)]
*  the Iranian military complex, regular army, regular air force, but more importantly, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=609.7199999999999s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard, Quds Force, Revolutionary Guard Air Force, and their drone units and their [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  ballistic missile units. And I'd consume all the time given to me if I'd go over a list of the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=623.8s)]
*  people, because it is a long list of very senior Iranian officials, including nuclear scientists [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=630.04s)]
*  that have been taken out. A few months ago, six, seven months ago at FTD, we thought of three [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=637.48s)]
*  different families of targets that Israel would be able to strike, pure military, infrastructure and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=645.24s)]
*  regime and nuclear. What Israel has done over the last 12 and a half, 13 hours is to strike [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=653.32s)]
*  all of those targets from the three of those banks. And in addition to that, personnel, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=660.6s)]
*  which we didn't anticipate in FTD, because I think we were limited in terms of thinking of how [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=669.32s)]
*  excellent Israeli intel would be on the ground to allow Israel to strike with such precision [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=675.48s)]
*  in live targets. And I think Eyal will probably have the best insights on that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=681.64s)]
*  Now, when we look at what this means is, for me, very important. Israeli pilots, more than 200 [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=687.0s)]
*  aircraft participated in these sorties. I think we're speaking about four or five different [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=694.8399999999999s)]
*  sorties above Iran, all over Iran, Western, Northern, Southern and Eastern Iran, nuclear [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=701.0799999999999s)]
*  facilities and sensitive facilities. And so far, thankfully, all of our pilots have returned home [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=708.04s)]
*  safely. And I'm extremely grateful for that. The Iranian response so far, and I am very careful [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=713.7199999999999s)]
*  in what I'm saying, has been underwhelming. I think that Israel took good measures to immediately [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=721.8s)]
*  strike Iranian ballistic missile capabilities and to hit their command and control and their [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=728.68s)]
*  actual capacity to fire and to use their vast arsenal of ballistic missiles. I think Israel [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=735.48s)]
*  anticipated that this would be the immediate response of the Iranians and therefore targeted [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=741.16s)]
*  that immediately after taking out a vast amount of senior Iranian officials. Last point about the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=747.08s)]
*  region. Hezbollah, as you said correctly, used to be a tremendous force, a deterrent against Israel [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=754.2s)]
*  from even implementing our own sovereignty in Israel. Hezbollah violated Israeli sovereignty, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=762.84s)]
*  and we did very little about it. And I think Israel was deterred by Hezbollah in terms of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=769.96s)]
*  taking action against Iran. Looking back towards October 7, I think that the late Yekhiya Senwar [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=777.64s)]
*  has a tremendous burden, responsibility in really changing the balance of power in the Middle East. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=786.76s)]
*  His act of aggression, Hamas's act of aggression in Israel, set in motion a series of events that [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=795.88s)]
*  is now really knocking at the door of the Iranian regime and I think will have very far-reaching [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=802.3599999999999s)]
*  and strategic consequences. From my perspective, of course, they are positive from an Iranian [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=809.4799999999999s)]
*  revolutionary god and regime perspective, not so much. I think we're in for days, if not weeks, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=814.92s)]
*  of heightened tensions. I totally agree with what Monty is saying. Now the ball is in the Iranian [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  court. President Trump has said you should go and take the deal, otherwise things will get even [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=829.9599999999999s)]
*  worse for you. I don't know if they'll be cool-headed enough to do what's right and smart [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=835.16s)]
*  for them. But a part of me actually wishes that they don't because I know that Israel has [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=841.24s)]
*  additional targets and the additional capacity to continue and escalate this. And there are many [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=847.8s)]
*  more targets available that I think would have a direct effect on the ability of the regime [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=853.32s)]
*  to stay in power. So we will have lots to cover here, but I think this is a great day for Israel. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=859.4s)]
*  I think it's a great day for democratic countries. It's a great day defending against terrorism and [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=865.48s)]
*  deterring terrorism. And books and movies will be made about how the Mossad and Israeli Air Force [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  and other forces were able to infiltrate, strike, and successfully go home against what people [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  believed, including in Israel, was an extremely powerful and well-equipped military. They are IRGC [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=884.6s)]
*  and the Iranian Defense Forces, the Iranian military, but that has been proved to be [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=893.72s)]
*  questionable. Excellent roundup there. As I'm watching actually, just off the screen here, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=899.48s)]
*  I've been watching that the Iranian regime is now reporting that 78 people have been killed, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=906.12s)]
*  which is actually a remarkably low number. When you consider the large number of senior officials, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=911.0s)]
*  these are incredibly precise attacks. And that is remarkable in and of itself that you're not [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=916.52s)]
*  looking at a lot of collateral damage as Israel has been doing that. I think this is important [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=922.12s)]
*  because I think the Israelis are trying to stay on the right side with the Iranian people. And [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=927.08s)]
*  maybe, Eyal, you can speak to that in a second. Also, as I was listening to you, I was watching [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=932.12s)]
*  that Hezbollah has said that it will not initiate an attack against Israel in response to this [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=938.92s)]
*  attack by Iran. That is a remarkable turn of events here as well. I think a sign of weakening on the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=945.4s)]
*  part of Hezbollah. We knew that it was weak, but I think that was always going to be a question [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=951.24s)]
*  mark. So a lot of really interesting developments just as we've been speaking over the last 16 [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=955.08s)]
*  minutes or so. I want to turn now to Eyal. Eyal, thank you for waiting patiently. You have had a [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=962.6s)]
*  lot of experience in tracking the nuclear program in Iran. And I want to ask you about the significance [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=969.72s)]
*  here of the elimination of these scientists and the senior officials associated with the program. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=976.84s)]
*  I also want to ask you about this question I think is swirling right now. What prompted this attack [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  right now? I am hearing, I've been seeing indications, they're not saying so outright, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=990.52s)]
*  but it looked like Iran was maybe making a dash for a bomb. Was that what precipitated this in your [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=996.2800000000001s)]
*  mind? And I guess maybe anything else that you're looking at in terms of the targets, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1003.08s)]
*  where they've hit? I see a lot about Natanz, not seeing anything about Boushir and Fordo so far. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1007.08s)]
*  So I guess I'm just wondering what are they hitting and what's the logic? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of things. John, I'll try to cover them all. First again, thanks for bringing [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1016.6s)]
*  me over on this show. I think with your permission, we need to start with context [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1023.8000000000001s)]
*  and what has been happening with the Iranian nuclear program over the last few weeks and months. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1028.92s)]
*  Monte specified in the beginning, President Trump assigned two months for negotiations [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1035.5600000000002s)]
*  and they were over yesterday. The IAEA Board of Governors just yesterday voted, almost all of them, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1039.8000000000002s)]
*  only China, Russia, and I don't know who else, voted against a resolution stating that Iran is [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1046.28s)]
*  in noncompliance with the NPT, with the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a whole, basically [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1053.4s)]
*  saying that Iran has been lying to the IAEA and withholding information. And to that, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1061.48s)]
*  there is the element of weaponization. We've been talking about weaponization throughout [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1065.88s)]
*  the years, that this is the element that once Iran decides to pursue, it's a game over in the sense [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1071.16s)]
*  that time is up on the ability to operate, but also it means that they have crossed the threshold. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1078.52s)]
*  The Supreme Leader has been talking about his fatwa that Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1086.6s)]
*  Of course, in the archive, we had all of the information to suggest that this was wrong. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1091.16s)]
*  And now, as it appears, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that yesterday in his first [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1095.56s)]
*  address to the people in Hebrew, but also IDF has been putting out information about this. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1099.8s)]
*  It so seems that Iran has started moving materialized in concrete ways towards building [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1105.48s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. And if this is the case, as several pieces in FDD, including Amir Eshel in [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1113.08s)]
*  my piece from a few weeks ago, this changes everything. If Iran decides to go to weaponization, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1118.52s)]
*  there is no point in negotiation. There is no point in putting any trust in them. And there [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1123.8s)]
*  must be an act to stop the ability to reach a nuclear weapon. And I think, John, this is what [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1128.52s)]
*  we've been seeing evolving over the last week. There was a huge operation to disclose this, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1132.68s)]
*  to keep the element of surprise. And Jonathan has spoken about this. It's quite interesting and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1140.44s)]
*  exciting. We're not usually good at it. To my understanding, and again, with full [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1146.04s)]
*  carefulness on this, I think the Americans have been involved in this as well, both in messaging. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1152.8400000000001s)]
*  Clearly, they knew what was going on. I think it's more than just giving an advanced warning [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1158.04s)]
*  to the Americans that this was happening. But let's leave this for later. A lot will be unpacked [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1162.92s)]
*  on that as well. But when we understand this context, we understand why Israel had to attack. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1169.16s)]
*  And now, if organization has become such a critical point, it must be addressed also [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1174.68s)]
*  operationally. Because what is the means of Iran to build this weapon? It's the scientists [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1179.48s)]
*  and the laboratories, because the materials are already produced by the centrifuges. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1186.44s)]
*  I think what we've been seeing is a cyclone as the attack with vast capabilities, a lot of [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1191.64s)]
*  Mossad activity, which makes me proud personally, of course, that we're able to hit very precisely, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1196.2800000000002s)]
*  simultaneously, in surprise, in the middle of the night, with low collateral damages, he said, John, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1202.68s)]
*  to get this job done effectively. I think we'll need to wait and see what is the extent. There is [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1208.5200000000002s)]
*  a whole list of people who's already been posted. And the Iranians are saying and giving names as [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1214.68s)]
*  well. But this seems rather elaborate. That's not the weaponization. And now, of course, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1220.84s)]
*  the enrichment program, which is the core of the program at the moment and where Iran will need to [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  do the final enrichment to 90% that most of our viewers already heard so many people on FDD [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1231.56s)]
*  morning briefs talk about. Clearly, it seems that the IDF has attacked Natanz, which is an [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1236.6799999999998s)]
*  underground bunker, very hard to attack and to penetrate. But Israel was probably able to do [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1243.0s)]
*  this. There is a question of the other underground facility in Ferdow put under a mountain. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1248.68s)]
*  We haven't heard a lot about it. And we need to be fair. There was a reason why Israel always said [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1253.5600000000002s)]
*  that with the Americans, we can do much more damage because the multi-ordinates penetrators, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1259.0s)]
*  what's called the MOP, that can be carried only by your huge stealth bombers, that's the weapon we [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1263.72s)]
*  needed to penetrate effectively a site like Ferdow. And maybe it's still waiting. And maybe we'll see [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1269.64s)]
*  surprises of what Israel was also able to do there in the future. So this is about the enrichment [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1275.96s)]
*  sites. We haven't heard a lot about the stockpile of the enrichment. This is very, very difficult [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1281.08s)]
*  to do. And because you mentioned Ferdow, I'll respond. Israel did not intend to attack Bushir. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1285.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. You mentioned Bushir. That's the civilian energy nuclear reactor. Israel does not [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1289.8s)]
*  intend to attack that reactor. We shouldn't have thought this would be attacked because it's an [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1298.44s)]
*  operational civilian facility built by the Russians and the fuel is supplied and taken [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1303.08s)]
*  care of by the Russians. So no surprises there. But this is kind of the full extent of the nuclear [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1310.36s)]
*  program and we'll see how this unfolds. And as Jonathan mentioned, we also took out ballistic [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1316.12s)]
*  capabilities to prevent them from attacking properly and their chain of command of IRGC. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think we already see this is going chaos out of Iran. And that's very, very important. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1326.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Excellent roundup. I'll just say that there are stories right now about chaos in the streets [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1331.96s)]
*  of Iran, that people are trying to get their gas tanks filled and they're trying to buy food and [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1337.3999999999999s)]
*  that people are in panic. And it's amazing as I look outside here, my window from Jerusalem, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1342.2s)]
*  the complete opposite. I mean, just calm and orderly. And you do get a sense that the Israelis [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1347.1599999999999s)]
*  were ready for this. I'm also watching on my screen right now that it looks like Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1352.6799999999998s)]
*  no surprise, is doing outreach to world leaders, reporting back that there's a lot of support for [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1357.8s)]
*  what happened. We'll have to see. I mean, every time Israel has attacked other nuclear programs, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1363.6399999999999s)]
*  this is of course the third nuclear program that Israel has attacked, right? They did the one in [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1368.04s)]
*  1981 in Iraq and they did the one in 2007 in Syria and there were condemnations worldwide. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1372.52s)]
*  I think it'll be interesting to see whether they're condemned here or not. But I think probably the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1378.6s)]
*  most important thing in my mind is what happens inside Iran. And I wanted to just ask you for just [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1383.32s)]
*  two minutes, Eyal. I've got a question left in the tank for each one of you, but Eyal, if you can [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1389.3999999999999s)]
*  answer this one, what do you think happens? Do the people try to use this as a moment to rise up [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1393.8799999999999s)]
*  against the regime? Because I think in the name of the operation that Israel assigned to this [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1399.3999999999999s)]
*  operation, this is what they're implying, are they not? So first, John, we must hope that the people [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1405.6399999999999s)]
*  of Iran will use an opportunity, this opportunity, any opportunity to get back what's theirs and [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1412.68s)]
*  that's their freedom to live a proper life in Iran, which is really a beautiful and amazing and [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1420.04s)]
*  resourceful country run by Mullah's supreme leader with a radical regime that is oppressing its own [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1426.52s)]
*  people. What I'm getting from the groups from Iran and from dissidents outside of Iran is a lot of [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1435.16s)]
*  frustration on all across the board in Iran, including from areas that are usually supporting [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1442.12s)]
*  the regime. They do not understand how is it possible that Iran is in such dysfunction, that [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1449.2399999999998s)]
*  they cannot protect themselves, that they are surprised this way, that after all of the of the [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1454.28s)]
*  brab talk, Israel is able to do what Iran has suggested that is completely impossible to do. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1459.2399999999998s)]
*  Does that translate into a movement of the people against the regime? You know, again, we should hope [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1466.1999999999998s)]
*  so. I don't know. We'll have to see. It could also rally them around the flag because they feel that [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1471.4s)]
*  their nation has been attacked. That's also possible and we've seen this kind of things [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1475.64s)]
*  happening back in April and October. But at the end, we need to understand two things. First, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1481.0800000000002s)]
*  from an Israeli perspective, this matters less. What's important from an Israel perspective, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1486.6000000000001s)]
*  we always said Iran should never get a nuclear weapon and if it is clear that Iran was going to [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1490.8400000000001s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, we have to act because we defend our people and there is no questions about that. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1495.16s)]
*  As for Iran, again, I just hope that they seize an opportunity. The Iranian people deserve much, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1500.6s)]
*  much more and I hope that we all give them the support that they need. It's a maximum support [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1505.08s)]
*  and not just maximum pressure on Iran. Yeah, and we actually did see some new sanctions [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1509.7199999999998s)]
*  handed down by the Treasury Department, I think just yesterday, perhaps even in anticipation of [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1514.28s)]
*  what is happening right now. That's really interesting. Mani, I want to turn to you for [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1520.1999999999998s)]
*  a second and then I'll wrap up with Jonathan. But for you, I want to ask you really, I think, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1524.6799999999998s)]
*  two things. One is, you know, Eyal talked about the B-2 and the mop. Israel doesn't have that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1529.32s)]
*  Does that mean that it just can't touch these underground facilities? That's question one for [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1535.72s)]
*  you. The other is, I want to point out something and I don't know if you have any comments on it, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1540.2s)]
*  but we understand that the Israelis created a forward base inside Iran. That looked a lot [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1544.6s)]
*  like what the Ukrainians just did in Russia when they destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1549.8s)]
*  worth of aircraft. Do you see any connection between those two operations? So first, you're [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1555.72s)]
*  right. I'll talk about the massive ordnance penetrator. That's the 40,000 plus pound weapon [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1562.6000000000001s)]
*  that can really only be carried by B-2. Look, there's value in penetration depth, you know, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1568.52s)]
*  how deep you can go in something. And, you know, so not having that probably does limit the extent [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1573.48s)]
*  of damage. It doesn't, that doesn't mean you can't figure out other ways to do damage. That doesn't [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1579.08s)]
*  mean that you can't combine aerial and non-aerial attack vectors to do more damage. So I'm confident [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1584.2s)]
*  that as part of a campaign plan, they're achieving the maximum damage they can to that with the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1592.8400000000001s)]
*  equipment they have to those deeper bunkered facilities. And, you know, Iran's not, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1599.0800000000002s)]
*  they're not number one in a lot, but believe it or not, they're number one in concrete [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1604.04s)]
*  development and technology. And there's a reason for that because they were, you know, they've been [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1607.8s)]
*  planning on these kind of attacks from Israel. So look, do I think it would be enhanced if you [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1611.88s)]
*  used a massive ordnance penetrator for a B-2? Probably. Do I think it's necessary? We'll find [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1617.5600000000002s)]
*  out. I'll bet that even without it, you can set, you can set back these production things closer [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1622.2s)]
*  to years than months. So that's good. You know, even more years would be even better. So we'll have [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1628.2s)]
*  to see. But this is not a tool you can give someone unless they have the right kind of aircraft to [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1633.88s)]
*  deliver it. On the issue of the, of a forward operating base, I would say actually this looks [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1639.0s)]
*  a lot more like 1980, 80, when the United States attempted to free the hostages in Iran. That's [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1643.56s)]
*  where we actually set up a forward operating base in Iran. I would put Operation Spiderweb, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1650.2s)]
*  the Ukrainian Spiderweb, it's still, I would put it much more akin to the beeper walkie talkie [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1656.52s)]
*  thing in the sense of getting inside, you know, using an innovative way to get at a supply chain. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1661.32s)]
*  One way to play where I do think it's similar is the idea of putting your weapon system inside the [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1667.64s)]
*  inner defense of the other. In other words, I have trouble penetrating with this kind of weapon [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1672.5200000000002s)]
*  system, then I'll go ahead and put a forward operating base inside your inner defenses, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1676.6000000000001s)]
*  and then let it operate from there. So in that regard, yes, I am confident this was a very [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1682.1200000000001s)]
*  short-lived fob. You know what I mean? It stood up, existed, and stood down to the degree that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1688.44s)]
*  we'll ever have proof that it existed. You know, there'll be a little bit of trash left at the site. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1694.52s)]
*  So we'll find out a little bit more. But look, if this thing extends and goes on, one of the options [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1698.76s)]
*  the United States has is to use a B-2 bomber. As I've told you, I mean, this is just sort of like [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1704.12s)]
*  the pilot eating a subway sandwich while he passes over. I'm not worried about the risk. I think [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1709.16s)]
*  Israel has removed the air defense risk, the limited one that might even apply to a B-2. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1714.52s)]
*  So we could be involved. That's a very hard political decision though for the president. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1719.4s)]
*  Right now, he has a standoff thing like, I warned you, come back and talk to me. I warned you. And [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1723.8s)]
*  by the way, I'll give you another 30 minutes. Keeping that option open. Keeping that option open. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1728.68s)]
*  Yeah. All right, Jonathan, I want to wrap up with you and they all. I think you need to go. If you [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1731.72s)]
*  need to jump, you guys can feel free. But Jonathan, I'll end with you here. I want to ask you, I mean, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1735.08s)]
*  I'm seeing reports right now that the Vangoran Airport is going to be closed until probably at [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1740.36s)]
*  least Sunday, maybe longer. I'm seeing that there were two IDF soldiers that were killed [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1745.4s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. So in other words, this war is, it's not just winning right now. It's not just [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1753.5600000000002s)]
*  Israel dominating. There are things that are happening on the negative side of the ledger. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1758.76s)]
*  We're still seeing the impact here. How do you assess in general what this has done here in [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1762.68s)]
*  Israel? I mean, when you look at how Israel, the society, how everybody is tackling this war, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1769.64s)]
*  how they're viewing it, how do you assess what has changed, what has not? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1775.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's important to emphasize that Israel is locked down. Israel has taken preventive measures [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1780.52s)]
*  in Judea and Samaria, basically minimizing the ability of people, Israelis and Arabs, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1788.76s)]
*  to be out and about in order to minimize friction and to minimize the ability of sporadic attacks [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1796.68s)]
*  or otherwise organized attacks against Israeli targets in Judea and Samaria or elsewhere. So [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1803.0s)]
*  that's a preventive measure. All of the security forces along all the borders are on high alert. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1808.52s)]
*  The IDF announced that they are speeding up the founding and putting on the ground [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1815.96s)]
*  of a division headquarter that will be responsible for the eastern front with Jordan, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1827.24s)]
*  the so-called Gilad division that was planned for a month and a half in the future. But it's [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1834.1200000000001s)]
*  going to happen very shortly, understanding that there's a viable threat that could emanate from [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1841.24s)]
*  the east. And yes, this is a 3D chess. We understand that the Iranians have tools. We understand, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1845.96s)]
*  we know that the Iranians have been cultivating agents in Israel, trying to sow dissent, trying [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1853.96s)]
*  to demoralize Israeli society, collecting intel on Israeli seniors, nothing close to the level [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1860.28s)]
*  of professionalism and capabilities that the Mossad has been doing for years in Iran. But [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1866.52s)]
*  nevertheless, the Iranians are doing so. And I think that we can anticipate, and Israelis are [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1871.96s)]
*  anticipating sporadic attacks, low-level spontaneous attacks. We will see, we will [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1877.48s)]
*  encounter attempts, I'm sure, by Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and by other Palestinian organizations to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1883.96s)]
*  attack whatever is close at hand, which is more of the ordinary which we're used to. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1891.4s)]
*  And in terms of Israeli society, I think we're still in the shock stage, getting our heads [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1896.76s)]
*  around the situation. But I think it's very important that this is going well so far. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1904.84s)]
*  And that has a significant influence on how people relate to it. This is a tremendous so far. And I'm, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1912.12s)]
*  of course, careful with what I say. This is a tremendous military and intelligence success so [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1919.08s)]
*  far. And it is something that it's easy to relate with, Mossad, Air Force, etc. And so far, that is, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1924.04s)]
*  I think, the tone. And I think Israelis are latching on to that. But also understanding [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1932.28s)]
*  that we are dealing with a master puppeteer and an organized country that is capable of [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1941.16s)]
*  sending proxies to do their dirty work. And we have to anticipate it. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1947.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're absolutely at the, I think you hit it on the head in the beginning of the [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1952.52s)]
*  program. We're at the beginning of the beginning here. We're not even at the end of the beginning. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1958.04s)]
*  I think this is really the opening frame of this war. I think Israelis, you're right, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1961.8s)]
*  I think they're adjusting to this new reality, trying to figure out what new normal looks like. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1966.28s)]
*  And it's been a year and a half of trying to figure out what that new normal is. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1970.76s)]
*  Guys, we're going to leave it here. I want to thank Eyal Hulata, who's already left the program. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1974.28s)]
*  I want to thank you, Jonathan Konrikis and Mark Montgomery, both, for joining us. Guys, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1978.52s)]
*  we're going to keep watching this. We may go live again over the weekend. We'll certainly be back [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1983.08s)]
*  on Monday for more FTD Morning Brief. Really remarkable, historic times in the Middle East. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1987.88s)]
*  I want to thank you for joining today. I'm Jonathan Schanzer, signing off for FTD. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_k6IKBfZc&t=1992.8400000000001s)]
