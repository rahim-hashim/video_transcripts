# Dave Smith | Game Over For The Dems? | Part Of The Problem 1245
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI)
*  What's up everybody. Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. Robert Bernstein, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=0.0s)]
*  you were talking, you got caught. Ha ha. You look stupid. How are you, sir? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=11.48s)]
*  I'm doing well. Film some real stupid shit over the weekend. Excited to get it out. The [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=15.76s)]
*  nice part about being home. That's what I like to hear. I like to know that when we're [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=19.92s)]
*  not on the road, you're, you're filming stupid shit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=23.84s)]
*  This is the most highly produced stupidest thing I've done yet. Check it out. Newsroom [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=27.66s)]
*  on YouTube will be out this week. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=31.54s)]
*  Ooh, that was quite a good a good promo. I like that. You've got me excited. And of course, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=33.42s)]
*  then this weekend, me and you are going back up to Boston. Very excited for that. I haven't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=39.1s)]
*  been to Boston in too long. And it's only a few days away now. The 27th, 28th and 29th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=44.54s)]
*  We will be up at Laugh Boston comic Dave Smith com for those tickets. And then I'm off to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  the races, doing a lot of traveling and a bunch for a standup. And then some other big [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=57.3s)]
*  podcasts coming up. Comic Dave Smith.com. There's also Nashville is next. I think there's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=62.81999999999999s)]
*  still some tickets for those shows. And then yay, it will be on the road for the rest of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=67.62s)]
*  the year. I know you got some other headline gigs coming up, Rob. Isn't that right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=72.42s)]
*  I got a steamboat. I think it's April 5th and 6th. Then the weekend after that, I've [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=75.94s)]
*  got a Des Moines. I think I finally got that right. Hanging out at a libertarian event. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=79.86s)]
*  Scott Horton's there the next night. I think Josh Smith lives out there. He got some cool [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=84.42s)]
*  stuff going on. So come hang out. I'm doing a standup Friday night. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=88.02s)]
*  All right. Sounds good. All right. Well, let's get into it for today. There's a lot going on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=92.98s)]
*  in the world or a few things that we specifically wanted to talk about. And I guess, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  you know, I sometimes I wonder like at a point right now, I think I don't know if this is true, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=107.94s)]
*  but I think probably of all the times that I've been in this podcasting game, there's been a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=117.94s)]
*  decent amount of time at this point. There's probably never been a period of time where I've [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  felt like there was more that was more interesting. There's more just kind of like [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=132.1s)]
*  incredible things going on where you're like, oh, this is like truly historic. There's also [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=138.5s)]
*  there's kind of never been a time where there were more options of what to talk about and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=145.7s)]
*  more distractions than right now. I just found it kind of interesting as I'm like preparing for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=152.1s)]
*  the show and I'm kind of like, all right, well, yeah, this seems like a lot of but a lot to do [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=157.14s)]
*  about nothing. This kind of seems like a distraction. And then I'm like trying to more and more focus [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  on like, what are the major things going on right now? And to some in some ways, I was like a little [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=168.82s)]
*  bit torn because as I've mentioned, you know, to you, Rob, several times, I and to all of you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  listeners, one of the things, you know, it's almost easy at this point to like ignore the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=184.74s)]
*  Democrats. Like right now, you could almost find yourself just being like, well, they're down and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=189.94s)]
*  out. They're losers. They're irrelevant. You know, the corporate media is irrelevant, all of this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=194.18s)]
*  So let's just focus on this. But I can't help but feeling that number one, it's a really interesting [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  story where the Democrats go from here and that it's actually something important to talk about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=206.74s)]
*  Like what when you see one of the major two political parties more defeated than at any [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=214.5s)]
*  point in my life, it's like, are they going the way of the wigs? Are they going to make some giant [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=219.86s)]
*  comeback? What you know what I mean? Like, and what exactly is what is going to be changed about [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=224.98s)]
*  the Democrats going forward? Because it's got to be something. And anyway, that's just something [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=230.66s)]
*  that's been on my mind. And it's kind of what the first two clips that I have on today's show are [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=235.54s)]
*  about that topic. Just to be clear, I don't mean to suggest that like we should prioritize focus on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=240.18s)]
*  this over focus on what the current administration is doing. I think we could try to do both over the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=246.18s)]
*  next coming weeks and months. But I do find it very interesting when there is when the recent [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=251.46s)]
*  events have been so devastating for the Democrats. And then you see all of these different kind of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=261.46000000000004s)]
*  competing forces and these competing ideas, if you want to call them that, of what we do going [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=266.1s)]
*  forward. I do find that interesting. Okay, so why don't we we could jump right into this. I'd say [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=272.58000000000004s)]
*  let's start with the first video that I sent you, Alex, which is Ellie Mistel. I don't think I ever [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=282.26000000000005s)]
*  had that name memorized. But I know he is the fat black guy with white hair on MSNBC. I know that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=294.18s)]
*  much about him. I've seen him many times and he's an unforgettable figure to see. But I do have to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  say now I know this is a little bit unfair because this is MSNBC and no one watches. But I did find [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=307.70000000000005s)]
*  this to be really interesting. Because with all of the kind of different, you know, the dynamic is [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=313.3s)]
*  that essentially, I think, the Democrats were denying reality for a very long time, denying [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=321.38s)]
*  reality in any area of life. I think most people who are, let's say, adult age people, maybe say [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=332.02s)]
*  25 and over, have probably at least once in their life, if not a few times, learned what is an [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=340.42s)]
*  invaluable life lesson. It applies to all areas of life. But that denying reality is a dangerous [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=347.46s)]
*  game. And reality has a way of slapping you in the face when you ignore it. You know, you can ignore [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=355.29999999999995s)]
*  reality, but the fact is it's still reality. And that eventually, you know, like if you're ignoring [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  gravity and you jump off a balcony, reality is going to slap you in the face. In this case, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=368.82s)]
*  it would be the ground. And what Democrats are dealing with, by and large, is that they, you know, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=374.98s)]
*  they staked out very unpopular positions for many years. They denied the unpopularity of those [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=381.54s)]
*  opinions. They denied the mental state of the former president of the United States of America. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=390.5s)]
*  They denied a lot. And that reality came and slapped them in the face. And now they can't deny [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=396.98s)]
*  it anymore. So they're all making different attempts to grapple with it and different [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=401.22s)]
*  attempts to strategize. Here is the latest that I've seen on MSNBC. Okay, so like what? Well, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  we could eliminate all voter registration laws. See, when Democrats get in charge, we try to protect [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=415.94000000000005s)]
*  voting rights. We don't make voting easier. Now, I'm all for voter eligibility requirements. I might, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=420.98s)]
*  we might disagree about what those requirements should be. But, you know, I'm going to say that, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=427.94s)]
*  like, there should be an age limit to vote. I might say 16. You might say 18, but I'm not going to say [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=432.18s)]
*  eight. Right. So we're going to agree that there should be voter eligibility requirements. But once [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=437.06s)]
*  you're eligible, why do you have to preregister? Why is that even a thing? It wasn't a thing in [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=441.94s)]
*  this country at the founding. We didn't have voter pre-registration in 1787. We didn't have voter [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=447.86s)]
*  pre-registration in 1821. We only started having voter registration, generally speaking, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=452.82s)]
*  after the Civil War. Why do you think that is? It's because a bunch of freed African slaves were [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=458.26s)]
*  migrating up north and all of a sudden New York was like, we need some registration up in here. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=464.65999999999997s)]
*  Right. A bunch of immigrants from Europe, mainly Ireland and Italy, were coming to New York. People [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  were like, oh, we need some registration in here. If you're eligible to vote, you should be [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=473.86s)]
*  automatically registered to vote. And that is how they do it everywhere else but us. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=478.1s)]
*  Everywhere else but us either has automatic registration or some other form of forced [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=483.78000000000003s)]
*  registration for everybody so that you don't have this disconnect between eligible voters [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=489.54s)]
*  and registered voters. That's the first law in the book that we could change. And to see how [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=494.98s)]
*  that's different than just saying, we have to protect voting rights. No, no, no. We don't have [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=499.3s)]
*  to protect voting rights. We have to expand voting rights so that the 90 million people [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=502.74s)]
*  that sat on the couch and sat out this last election between democracy and fascism so that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=507.7s)]
*  maybe they had a little bit of an easier time to get up off the couch and come participate in the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=512.5s)]
*  democracy. All right. Now, I think it might be fairly obvious why this caught my eye. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=517.3s)]
*  I just think it's, look, there's a lot that was just like kind of packed in there. And we can get [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=525.54s)]
*  into it. I'd like to kind of parse all this out. Rob, I don't know if you're for voter [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=531.78s)]
*  registration, but if you are, you're racist. That's the takeaway. But isn't there seems to me to be [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=537.62s)]
*  something of an interesting admission kind of buried within this strategy, which is essentially [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=544.5799999999999s)]
*  that we've kind of given up on the electorate. You know, it's like, look, I don't think we can [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=553.7s)]
*  win with this electorate. So what if we get all these other people who aren't voting? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=561.86s)]
*  It's funny to me what the mentality of this would be because you're saying 90 million people sat [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=568.1800000000001s)]
*  out the last election between democracy and fascism. And yet those are the people you're [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=574.9000000000001s)]
*  counting on. The people who saw, you know, democracy versus fascism on the ballot and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=583.14s)]
*  couldn't even be bothered to, you know, it's a pretty minimal effort what it takes to vote. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=588.8199999999999s)]
*  Like I've never, I've never talked to any voter. Maybe I'm just talking to the wrong groups of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  people, but I've never talked to any voter who is like, it is just insane what they make you go [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=600.58s)]
*  through in order to vote. There's lots of other things where that would be my complaint. Like it's [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=605.14s)]
*  insane what it takes for me to build a fence in my backyard. That is genuinely insane. It's insane [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=609.86s)]
*  that I have to go down and wait in a line and pay a fee and then come back months later, just to put [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=615.78s)]
*  a goddamn garden in my fucking backyard. But I've never heard anyone say that about voting. But now [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=620.1s)]
*  you have these people who would not step over the tiniest hurdle in the world in order to save [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=625.54s)]
*  democracy. And your plan is to eliminate that hurdle. It just doesn't seem like a, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=634.66s)]
*  it doesn't seem like the best strategy ever. I don't know. Any thoughts on any of this, Rob? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, that certainly stood out to me when he said that there were 90,000, 90 million voters, I guess, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=645.54s)]
*  who decided not to vote against what he said. Tyranny, he can quite use that word, but that's [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=650.5s)]
*  what he's implying. It was the end of democracy and 90 million people just didn't show up. I mean, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=657.06s)]
*  clearly it wasn't the end of democracy because I'd have to think that 90 million people, if all [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=662.34s)]
*  they needed to do was register to vote and we could keep our democracy, they'd probably do so. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=667.46s)]
*  So speaking to that, I mean, this guy who looks like he was drawn by Dilbert, like he's just a [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=672.9s)]
*  cartoon character and this is clearly nonsense that, you know, it was the end of our democracy [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=677.7s)]
*  and just 90 million people weren't engaged. No, you didn't earn those people's votes. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=682.34s)]
*  The point is we don't believe you. We don't believe that this was the end of our democracy. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=686.98s)]
*  Yeah, that was clearly nonsense. He didn't sell those people. And, you know, you and I have done [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=691.62s)]
*  hundreds of episodes explaining why the Democrats were not the better option in this past election. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=696.0999999999999s)]
*  So the starting point of your analysis just being 90 million people were uninterested in [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=700.42s)]
*  keeping the democracy, it's because you're lying. With that being said, I think that there absolutely [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=704.66s)]
*  should be a requirement to show your identification in order to vote. And there should be a mechanism [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=710.66s)]
*  that ensures the fact that you're actually a U.S. citizen. My entire and the fact that apparently [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=718.82s)]
*  acquiring IDs is racist is something that the government should fix because there's so many [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=724.6600000000001s)]
*  other activities that you require ID for. So if you would just think about all of the ways that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=729.7s)]
*  our society seems to be racist because apparently people can't drive cars, they can't purchase [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=735.38s)]
*  alcohol, they can't check into hotels. And the fact that the government doesn't want to fix [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=740.34s)]
*  that process and make it easier for people to just partake in civil society, I mean, we should [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=744.82s)]
*  be addressing the racism issue of our government that it makes it hard for minorities to acquire [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=749.22s)]
*  IDs. With that said, removing voter registration, but keeping the fact that you have to have your [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=753.5400000000001s)]
*  ID to prove you're a U.S. citizen, I don't care if there's a registration process. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=758.74s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I'll be honest. I don't particularly care either. I just find this line of argument to [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=763.22s)]
*  be so flawed and just inaccurate. I mean, look, when he says at the beginning, he goes, look at [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=772.26s)]
*  the founding of the country, you don't have to register to vote. It's like, okay, that is true. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=778.98s)]
*  But you're also invoking a time when only white male landowners could vote. And so if you're [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=785.46s)]
*  framing voter registration as some type of restriction on voting rights, right? I mean, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  that's how we framed it. We're expanding voter rights. It's like, well, then I don't really think [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=801.06s)]
*  that this would be the example to look to. And I do think that there's something, you know, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=805.4599999999999s)]
*  because there is something about the modern woke historian that will essentially insist that the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=814.0999999999999s)]
*  entire, you know, all of history can be understood as it used to be racist. That's, you know, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=821.94s)]
*  that used to be racist, or maybe it used to be sexist. And if we want to go really far, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=831.0600000000001s)]
*  it used to be homophobic or something like that. But that's basically all of history. But it's just [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=836.6600000000001s)]
*  what, I don't know, it's an interesting, you know, additional piece of information that it was also [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=841.46s)]
*  restricted to landowners, and that white, free white men still could not vote if they didn't own [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=848.02s)]
*  land. And there was a concept behind that. And you can agree or disagree with that. But the idea was [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=856.18s)]
*  that if we're voting over how to spend the treasury, you know, which was, of course, was a much smaller [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=864.5799999999999s)]
*  pot at the time. But if we were voting over like, how to spend public money, you couldn't allow [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=873.78s)]
*  people with nothing to have a say in that too. Because there's no incentive there for them to not [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=880.26s)]
*  vote all the stuff for themselves. And then we're all poor together. And that you actually had to be [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=886.02s)]
*  somewhat, you had to be in the owner class in society in order to make decisions. Now, again, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=892.3399999999999s)]
*  you can disagree with that. There's flaws in that way of looking at things. But it, you know, there [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=900.1s)]
*  also is an argument to the fact that like, yeah, owners get to make decisions about what's done [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=906.82s)]
*  with things that people who don't own it don't get to make. And that is to some degree important. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=911.62s)]
*  Now, his point about how these voter registration laws were put into effect after the Civil War or [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=918.9s)]
*  during periods of mass immigration, you know, I certainly would not argue, in fact, I don't think [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=926.18s)]
*  anyone could really argue that there haven't been voter restrictions in the past that were intentionally [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=934.42s)]
*  designed to keep some people out or that were just abused in practice, thinking literacy tests or [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=939.78s)]
*  things like that. Now, that being said, it does not necessarily follow from that, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=949.14s)]
*  that you ought to have the view that there should be absolutely no standard or absolutely no minimal, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=956.58s)]
*  you know, like test before you get to vote. Like, for example, let's just say that it wasn't abused. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=966.26s)]
*  Right? Like, let's just say, yeah, it's just a hypothetical. And if your answer to this would [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=976.34s)]
*  be like, well, I don't support it because it can be abused in practice, that's a totally reasonable [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=980.26s)]
*  answer. I'm just saying, in theory, you know, hypothetical, would a literacy test necessarily [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=984.9s)]
*  be wrong? Like, should, you know, we're voting over who gets to rule the most powerful government [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=994.58s)]
*  in the history of the world here. Would it be, let's just say hypothetically, there were a way [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1001.7s)]
*  to enforce it that wasn't discriminatory and wasn't unfair, but it was just like, hey, like, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1007.94s)]
*  if you can't read a chapter, like if you can't read at third grade level, then you don't get to vote. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1012.58s)]
*  Is that in itself in principle draconian or awful or something like that? Because I got to say, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1019.94s)]
*  I don't think it is. I actually think it's kind of crazy the idea that illiterate people get to [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1027.06s)]
*  vote. Now, again, I'm not saying I would necessarily support that restriction because it can be abused, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1032.26s)]
*  but I do think that like it's interesting when you have a situation where there is nobody to, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1036.74s)]
*  I mean, this guy, I guess, would make that argument, but I don't think any serious person [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1043.3s)]
*  can really say that voter registration is done to target black people or to target a certain group [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1046.74s)]
*  of people or keep them out. And I do just find something interesting about the question of like, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1052.9s)]
*  is the minimum requirement, like, let's just say, I said, you have to put pants on and go outside. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1057.7800000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? And you were like, we got to get rid of this requirement. You're kind of like, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1065.5400000000002s)]
*  wait, wait, who is it you're trying to get to vote? Why is it you're trying to you're telling me that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1068.66s)]
*  the person who can't figure out registering to vote or doesn't care enough to figure it out and [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1073.46s)]
*  go do it, that it's that important to make sure that guy's voice counts, too? I just find this to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1079.3s)]
*  be a very strange, like, again, I'm with you, Rob. I'm not saying like, I'm not married to the idea [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1085.54s)]
*  of voter registration. Should you automatically be registered? Perhaps. I guess maybe my issue in it [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1090.58s)]
*  is like, in the same sense of like, you know, how like you might have a job interview, like at eight [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1096.58s)]
*  in the morning, and like half the test of that interview is just like, hey, can you show up on [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1104.34s)]
*  time at eight in the morning, looking presentable, like, just the lowest form of like, prove to me [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1109.62s)]
*  that you're participating in society here. And just for that reason alone, I tend to go like, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1117.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm not sure I want to make it easier to vote. I think before you vote in the popularity contest [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1124.1s)]
*  of who rules over me, maybe there should be some minimum requirement that you meet. Does that make [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1131.7s)]
*  sense? I don't know that I agree with it, but I, it certainly makes sense. I get where you're coming [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1137.7s)]
*  from. Well, it just seems like they're trying to stick up for the person who can't do any of that. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1144.02s)]
*  They're like, man, if we could get those people, maybe we could, you know what I mean? It's the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1149.06s)]
*  same reason like who the hell wants 16 year olds voting. Like, I don't know, this just already shows [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1153.54s)]
*  something about you. 16 years old is like, oh, look, we got to set the age somewhere. It's like, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1159.7s)]
*  okay, granted. And we all agree it's not eight because I might say 16, you say 18. I mean, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1165.14s)]
*  think about the fact that like, you'd listen, dude, if somebody, if an adult had consensual sex with [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1170.26s)]
*  a 16 year old, we all think they should go to fucking jail for a long, long time. And why is [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1179.06s)]
*  that? Because like a 16 year old can't really consent to an adult. It doesn't matter if they [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1186.26s)]
*  said it or you're, you're, you're just so psychologically and mentally more powerful than [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1191.3799999999999s)]
*  them that you are just totally like, it's, it's, it's just taking advantage of like prey in order [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1197.54s)]
*  for you to like extract some form of consent out of them. So who the hell are these people who it's [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1204.18s)]
*  like, that's where you want to go for your voting base. Like you got to look at the people who are [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1210.34s)]
*  fucking 16 and then the people who couldn't figure out how to register for a vote. And that's who you [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1215.3s)]
*  want to be. You know what I mean? To be your reinforcements. Like I just, I find it disturbing. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1221.06s)]

*  pitch instead of Hey, 90 million people are unengaged in our political process. And so I [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1338.02s)]
*  think we need to figure out how to speak to these other individuals, the rights that will get them [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1342.58s)]
*  to show up and vote for how do we compel these people to engage because and then make up some [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1347.06s)]
*  bullshit of I know that these are the people that would be better represented by the Democratic [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1352.26s)]
*  Party. And so we just have to figure out how to reach out to them. But to just say, hey, we have [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1358.34s)]
*  to make it easier for these people who are unengaged to show up. That's not that's not [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1362.5s)]
*  firstly, it doesn't seem like a winning strategy. I don't think the voter registration is what's [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1367.54s)]
*  getting in the way of these people voting. So you're just talking nonsense here. But now you're also [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1371.94s)]
*  just thinking like, how do I just get bodies here? Like, how do we not change any policy? How do we [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1376.26s)]
*  not change what we're doing? How do I just figure out how to win this game and get more bodies [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1381.06s)]
*  showing up? Because we can't vote the corpses anymore. We lost that one. We did it once and [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1385.22s)]
*  it worked for us. So what's our new scheme? We can't get immigrants over the border because [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1389.46s)]
*  we're not in control anymore. We were trying that one. So what do we have left? I don't know. We [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1393.3799999999999s)]
*  can make it easier for the other 90 million people to show up and offer them some free stuff. And [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1397.22s)]
*  maybe. Yeah, I mean, that's right. That's what it seems like to me. And there's, like I said before, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1401.3799999999999s)]
*  there's such an admission that you feel like you can't win with the electorate as it is. And look [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1407.06s)]
*  like, I don't know. I just, the Democrats, you're like, if you look around, you'd be like, hey, look, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1412.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, obviously you lost pretty bad in this election. But you know, Donald Trump's approval [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1420.26s)]
*  rating, from what I've seen, has been hovering between 47 and 53%. That's not like, oh my God, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1426.4199999999998s)]
*  it's insurmountable. You know what I mean? Like there's a good chunk of the country who's opposed [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1434.26s)]
*  to Donald Trump, maybe not a majority, but very close to half of the electorate is opposed to him. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1439.38s)]
*  And like you ran the most God awful candidate ever. So you would sit there and be like, okay, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1446.9s)]
*  all we got to do is like figure out a good candidate, figure out a good message, actually [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1452.5800000000002s)]
*  stand for something, actually do something for the American people. Instead this like going to, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1456.1000000000001s)]
*  well, let's see if we can't win over the people who are totally not engaged. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1462.02s)]
*  And then of course, the other major flaw in this strategy is that like, look, this is, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1468.98s)]
*  okay, so I don't know if I've ever told you this story before, but I always love this. Now, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1477.94s)]
*  this is something I've never done in my life in standup comedy. I don't think it's something [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1483.22s)]
*  you've ever done, but it is an old thing that you've probably heard of been done before. But [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1486.9s)]
*  I remember this one time I was watching this comic and he was bombing having a real rough one. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1491.46s)]
*  And it's just the crowd hated him. Nothing's going over his now. Now he's getting heckled and he [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1498.58s)]
*  hasn't gotten any laughs the whole set. And then at one point he goes, so one of the guys was [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1503.8600000000001s)]
*  heckling him and he goes, Oh yeah, dude, you think this is so easy. You want to try to do my job. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1508.9s)]
*  And he offers him the microphone to come on stage and come do it. Now, I don't know if you've ever [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1513.54s)]
*  heard of this, you know what I'm saying? You ever heard that? But I remember thinking to myself, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1519.7s)]
*  I was a young comic at the time too, but I was like, Oh man, this guy's instincts are so bad [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1524.1000000000001s)]
*  that he doesn't even get what that old game is. Like, okay, I've never done this and I would never [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1529.6200000000001s)]
*  do. I would never give up the microphone at a standup comedy show. I feel like that's yours. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1536.82s)]
*  You're the comedian. You get the microphone. You don't give that up. But the way that old dealing [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1540.26s)]
*  with a heckler thing works is that you're killing with the crowd. The crowd loves you. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1545.94s)]
*  One guy starts heckling and you go, Oh, you think this is so easy. Come up here, do that. This guy's [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1554.26s)]
*  totally unprepared to be a comedian. He gets on stage with a microphone. The whole crowd is [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1559.22s)]
*  rooting for this guy to lose. And so the cars are totally stacked against him. You're going to win [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1564.1000000000001s)]
*  this thing. Cause you came as a professional comedian with jokes and he has nothing. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1570.34s)]
*  You don't do that move when you're dying, when the crowd doesn't like, because God forbid [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1575.3s)]
*  this guy grabs the microphone and says one funny thing that gets some laughs. And now not only did [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1583.54s)]
*  you Bob your ass off at this set, but then this guy came and got laughs. And it's the worst moment [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1590.74s)]
*  in the history of the world. So anyway, the comic goes, give him like the manager of the club came [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1595.14s)]
*  in and broke it up, said, you can't have the microphone and brought the next comedian on stage. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1598.5s)]
*  It was a whole nightmare situation. Anyway, the point I'm making is this move has a prerequisite [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1602.58s)]
*  to it. Okay. Well, we're going to abolish voting registration. Well, that would have to be done [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1611.94s)]
*  with federal legislation, which you do not control. You have to get power back first. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1618.9s)]
*  So this is all, like the prerequisite to all of this is that you have to win back power first, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1628.8200000000002s)]
*  meaning you can't telegraph this strategy. You can't sit there and go, Hey, listen, voting [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1637.46s)]
*  electorate, I know you've rejected us, but if you elect us again, we are going to dilute down your [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1643.3s)]
*  votes with bodies who we think we can manipulate more easily. This is, this was a good strategy [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1650.66s)]
*  for when Joe Biden was in and the Democrats had Congress be like, do this now, hush, hush. We say [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1657.46s)]
*  quietly that a board room meeting somewhere, and then we won't have to worry about this next time. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1664.5s)]
*  It does not work as the underdog strategy to announce this as your plan to regain power. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1670.9s)]
*  If you get what I'm saying there. So I just find this funny that this is the music like on [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1678.8200000000002s)]
*  end MSNBC as the ratings are collapsing, they're going, I know what we're going to do. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1683.22s)]
*  Use all this power we have in the federal government to overhaul voting. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1689.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, anyway, as no matter how much you can try to spin this and try to play this as like, you know, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1694.18s)]
*  it's all these disenfranchised people or something that we're trying to give a voice. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1703.86s)]
*  The bottom line is that when you've taken a shellacking and you're on a network whose [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1708.02s)]
*  ratings are collapsing, when you come out here and go, we need to be able to get a whole different [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1712.98s)]
*  electorate. Uh, I don't see how that doesn't come off as, as weak and desperate. That'd kind of be [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1719.06s)]
*  my final thought. Any, any final thoughts on this one, Rob? I hope he, uh, returns to the Dilbert [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1726.58s)]
*  cartoon in which he came. I'm in, we can only pray. We can only pray. All right. Let's, uh, um, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1731.46s)]
*  there was another, I'm actually maybe a little bit embarrassed, uh, to admit this, but I wanted to go [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1737.78s)]
*  to this next clip because this was from a Bill Mars show, the kind of more or less on the same theme [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1743.1399999999999s)]
*  of the United States of America. Um, and a little embarrassment that I did not actually know this. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1749.54s)]
*  Um, so Bill Mar open talking about, um, kind of like the, uh, the, the future of jurymandering and, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1756.4199999999998s)]
*  um, results of the great migration ships within the United States of America over the last few [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1765.3799999999999s)]
*  years. Anyway, let's, let's go to this clip because I did find this really fascinating. Uh, here is Bill [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1770.6599999999999s)]
*  just to continue on this for a minute, because I just saw this really bad news for Democrats [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1776.8200000000002s)]
*  2030 reapportionment. There's a group called the American redistricting project. And in five years, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1781.78s)]
*  we will be redistricting California's projected to lose three seats, New York to also going to lose [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1787.0600000000002s)]
*  a seat, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Illinois, all blue States who's getting these Texas, Florida, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1793.94s)]
*  Idaho, and Utah. I mean, this looks like game over, you know, and the reason why people are [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1800.9s)]
*  voting with their feet is a lot of what your book is about taxes and regulation. I certainly been [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1806.66s)]
*  screaming about it forever. I did three years with a sign here that said, how long is it going to [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1813.6200000000001s)]
*  take me to get my solar hooked up three years talking about it on television in this state? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1818.26s)]
*  You couldn't do it. This state has almost 400,000 regulations. I just put in a new roof because [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1824.66s)]
*  the fire, I thought, Oh, let's get a roof. That's not going to burn up to inspections. Why are you [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1830.9s)]
*  inspecting my roof? It's my fucking roof. That's my problem. And we're taxed more than any other [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1836.42s)]
*  state. People are leaving these kinds of States for places where they're not led to feel the [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1848.9s)]
*  heavy breath of governments on them. It's just, it's not that hard for Democrats to understand [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1855.54s)]
*  this, but they seem to be incapable of doing anything about it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1861.54s)]
*  I thought there was a really powerful rant from Bill Maher and it's very interesting. I didn't [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1868.66s)]
*  realize how soon it was coming and how many seats were going to be going from blue States to red [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1875.3s)]
*  States, but he's not wrong. I mean, that's a really big deal. I think he rattled off 10 or 11 [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1880.66s)]
*  seats and in a closely divided Congress. I mean, that's a really big deal to take 10 or 11 seats [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1885.3000000000002s)]
*  and give them to the other side, which theoretically is where that's going. And it was interesting to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1891.6200000000001s)]
*  me to see kind of like a group of three liberals who are all at that table, having to kind of [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1897.94s)]
*  grapple with this fact that taxes and regulations like big government is unpopular. And of course it [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1905.22s)]
*  is. It wouldn't be government if it wasn't, you know what I mean? Like it would be done voluntarily [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1914.9s)]
*  if it were popular. And the, no, I think that probably there's a bit more to it than that. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1919.54s)]
*  I don't think it's as simple as taxes and regulation, but undeniably that is a huge component to this. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1929.06s)]
*  And it is, you know, when you have, and again, I don't want to do the thing that a lot of [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1938.98s)]
*  Democrats are doing right now where they're going like, they're acting like Donald Trump and Elon [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1948.1s)]
*  Musk were me and you, like we took over, you know, crystal ball said, anarcho capitalism is the [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1952.82s)]
*  driving ideology behind all these guys. And, you know, their mission is to destroy government [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1958.02s)]
*  or something like that. But when you kind of broadly, at least in the American people's minds, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1963.94s)]
*  have the idea that, okay, the Republican party is like, if I had a loose sketch of this, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1969.1399999999999s)]
*  they're talking about how there's fraud and abuse and government, how there's a swamp, how there's [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1974.42s)]
*  a deep state, and we have to kind of like roll that back. And then you have the Democrats over [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1978.82s)]
*  here who are like the party of government, the party of we need rules and regulations and all [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1983.62s)]
*  of these things. It's very challenging to be the party of government when all of your major cities [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1988.82s)]
*  where you guys are the government are a disaster, are all like the poster boy for inept, corrupt [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=1997.2199999999998s)]
*  government. That is a tricky position to be in. And that's really, I think, what's going on in [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2007.3799999999999s)]
*  a lot of these big cities. What are your thoughts, Rob? I didn't realize Bill Maher was such a [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2012.74s)]
*  libertarian. Hey, this is my roof. Why do I need the government coming in here and tell me how I [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2017.38s)]
*  should operate my own roof? It is it is I guess I should dig in a little bit more on just how much [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2022.5s)]
*  migration there's been from these large states. I'm sure that the problem for the Democrats is [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2030.98s)]
*  going to be amplified if there actually is a mass movement of illegal migrants out of the country. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2035.3s)]
*  And I'd love to see actual figures on that of exactly how many people came over and what that [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2041.7s)]
*  means for congressional seats, particularly as a lot of them did make their way to New York, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2046.26s)]
*  because there were good social services for a period of time, including hotel stays. And then [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2051.14s)]
*  even Republican governors were just busting them right up in there, which was actually a good [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2056.26s)]
*  strategy for educating the public at large. But it might have been a bad strategy for [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2061.14s)]
*  congressional seats. But anyways, it is I think one of the it happened in New York State, they [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2066.98s)]
*  got a massive federal bailout during COVID. And I thought that that was bad, because we need to [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2073.86s)]
*  showcase bad liberal policies in order for people to actually realize that they're failed policies [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2079.5400000000004s)]
*  and to make the correction of people leaving these areas, because it's corrective. And I think, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2085.5400000000004s)]
*  you know, it kind of showcases the bad policy failing when it actually fails. And I guess that [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2092.1s)]
*  this is a pretty good storyline that Republicans are going to pick up this many congressional [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2098.98s)]
*  seats. I didn't realize that it was that big. What's that? What was like 12 seats you just [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2102.9s)]
*  mentioned? It's pretty big. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think that the, you know, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2107.22s)]
*  there's basically been I think since really since 2020, late 2020, early 2021, the the exodus out [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2112.82s)]
*  of California and New York has really just not stopped. I mean, I think it's had higher and lower [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2124.9s)]
*  moments, but Hollywood's over. Like, I listen, I can't prove this to you. But it just seems that [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2130.7400000000002s)]
*  there's actually a lot more independent filming going on now. And it seems like more and more [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2137.94s)]
*  Hollywood projects are taking place in other areas. And I wonder how much star power really [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2142.02s)]
*  wants to hang out in that state versus going to new areas and just, you know, with more favorable [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2147.38s)]
*  taxes on the works. Like, why is everyone hanging on to California? Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2153.62s)]
*  if you've seen I mean, these are the things that I don't like. The stories that don't typically [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2160.02s)]
*  interest me that much. But I don't know if you've seen everybody's making a big deal out of this [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2165.7s)]
*  Snow White movie, I guess just totally flopped. And I feel like you'll be on beef, though. I [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2169.38s)]
*  didn't I didn't totally follow the story. But there was fun beef between Gal Gadot and the other lady [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2175.86s)]
*  because they were both making like opposing political views of her being pro Palestinian [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2181.06s)]
*  and Gal Gadot, the gorgeous Israeli. And so they got some they got some bad press up front over [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2186.26s)]
*  that. And I just thought that princess drama, pouring off screen of dissenting political views [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2191.94s)]
*  in the Disney environment, I dug in zero other than seeing the headline, but I just thought no, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2198.26s)]
*  I was hilarious. All all I saw was and I kind of feel bad because the girl seems so young. I mean, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2202.26s)]
*  I don't know how old she is, which she said her oldest in her early 20s. But the girl who's like [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2208.34s)]
*  the star of it was, you know, she she had several interviews where she was like, you know, just kind [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2214.6600000000003s)]
*  of like shitting on the old version and being like, you know, the original was made in 1937. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2220.26s)]
*  And like, you can totally tell. And we're not going to be doing that whole thing where we're [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2226.02s)]
*  waiting for a prince and we're doing that, you know, she's 23. OK, so I thank you. But so I, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2230.02s)]
*  you know, I'm really hesitant to ever like try to trash anyone that age, because like, I don't know [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2236.42s)]
*  what what she's doing is just the typical thing that we all did as adolescents. It's one of the [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2242.18s)]
*  unfortunate qualities, but it's also probably like a necessary quality. Like when you're young, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2247.06s)]
*  you have this tendency to be like, I've sized up the whole world and you know what? It's all [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2251.78s)]
*  bullshit. The grownups are all wrong. And that's, you know, there's there's some positive in that, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2256.42s)]
*  as well as some negative. As you get older, you're supposed to kind of gain a little bit more respect [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2262.1000000000004s)]
*  for your elders and be like, actually, maybe they did have a point. Maybe they learned a few lessons [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2268.1800000000003s)]
*  that I had to learn myself. But there is something about it that's very unappealing. You know, if [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2272.6600000000003s)]
*  it's very unappealing to listen to a teenager talk about how their parents are assholes and [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2278.26s)]
*  you're kind of like, yeah, but you know, they're both they're working their ass off to give you [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2283.46s)]
*  everything you have. So, you know, but so I'm not like, but there is something [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2287.6200000000003s)]
*  about watching. It's not her like whatever. She's a she's a young girl and she's probably [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2294.0200000000004s)]
*  very talented and is part probably part of the reason why she's here. What's crazy is that all [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2300.1800000000003s)]
*  the adults around her, you know, meaning Hollywood, put this front and center and then [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2305.14s)]
*  expected this to like sell well. And evidently, there took a huge flop on like the money they [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2312.3399999999997s)]
*  put in verse how many people want to see this thing. I just think there's something about this [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2317.62s)]
*  the point that we've gotten to where they almost seem incapable of readjusting and going like, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2326.2599999999998s)]
*  OK, we got to like we got to drastically cut overhead and really put out a product that [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2331.86s)]
*  our consumer base wants to say. They're just incapable of doing it. And so I agree with you. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2337.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, like, I really I don't know what the future of Hollywood is, but there seems no reason [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2343.78s)]
*  to me why there should be any future. Why the hell do you need these big studios anymore? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2347.6200000000003s)]
*  The people you got little I mean, I know this from from, you know, my work, I'm sure you do too, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2353.06s)]
*  Rob. But there are these little, you know, there are little production companies that you could pay [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2357.94s)]
*  like twenty thirty grand that can make like fucking magic happen. And some of these, I mean, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2363.2200000000003s)]
*  if you had like a few hundred grand to pay them, they could make a badass, cool looking movie for [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2368.42s)]
*  you. You know, it's like, why is it exactly that you need these big studios at that point? Anyway, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2373.86s)]
*  to Bill Maher's thing, you know. If you really want to look at it and I think there's [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2381.2200000000003s)]
*  probably someone could dig into the data and really find numbers to support this. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2388.98s)]
*  But the fact is that where when people really started fleeing out of the big cities in this [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2393.62s)]
*  country and like me and you are kind of two examples of this, Rob, but it was during Covid. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2403.14s)]
*  And it was the fact that the blue cities look, everybody locked down. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2408.42s)]
*  All due respect to Kristi Noem, who was the governor of South Dakota. She did not. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2413.46s)]
*  But, you know, it's still South Dakota. But for the rest of the country, everybody did the lockdowns. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2418.34s)]
*  But like the blue states just hung on so much longer and were so much stricter. Then it was [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2424.58s)]
*  way past the point way, way, way past the point where everyone had already come to terms with [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2431.78s)]
*  what level of risk they were comfortable with with the virus. And so they just kept these [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2436.74s)]
*  cities shut down. This is a big part of the reason why Austin had such a huge surge, because, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2442.1s)]
*  you know, people wanted to find a city where you could still go to a restaurant, where you could [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2450.8999999999996s)]
*  still be normal, where you didn't have to wear a mask everywhere, all this stuff. And then also, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2454.8999999999996s)]
*  as a result of those prolonged lockdowns, the homelessness, the drugs, the crime, I mean, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2461.38s)]
*  all of these things just got materially worse in all of the blue cities. And it is one of those [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2468.7400000000002s)]
*  things where it's pretty easy for somebody who is, let's just say, even slightly liens conspiratorial [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2474.58s)]
*  for them to just go, oh, George Soros is intentionally trying to destroy the United [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2485.3s)]
*  States of America. Why else would you do this? Well, you know, I mean, like, if your plan was [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2490.18s)]
*  to have prolonged lockdowns, and at the same time period, say, we're going to stop prosecuting [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2496.2599999999998s)]
*  property crime, we're also at the same time going to say, homeless people are allowed to build [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2503.94s)]
*  encampments on public sidewalks wherever they want to. I mean, like, what? Who could be shocked [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2509.54s)]
*  that people were like, oh, I think I might move them? Like, what did you think the result of all [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2518.58s)]
*  of this was going to be? That people would just, you know what I mean, accept it? It's no, people [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2523.86s)]
*  are moving. And then the really sick thing, right? This was so bizarre, and I guess seemingly ironic [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2529.2999999999997s)]
*  on first glance, but I think not actually ironic once you dive into it. But like, you know, when [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2536.2599999999998s)]
*  you see, let's say when you see people leaving, let's say Los Angeles and New York City by the [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2541.86s)]
*  hundreds of thousands every year, hundreds of thousands pouring out of the cities, and by the [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2549.46s)]
*  way, I should be clear, this was happening before COVID. It just picked up after the lockdowns. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2553.54s)]
*  But when you see that, well, if you dig a little bit deeper and look into who's moving, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2559.78s)]
*  it's almost all middle class, upper middle class, upper class people. That's who's leaving. Now, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2565.7000000000003s)]
*  you could sit there and say, oh, that's because of the taxes. Part of that's true. But the other [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2570.58s)]
*  major part of that is that, you know, working class and poor people just can't afford to move. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2576.18s)]
*  They just don't have that luxury. I mean, if you're if you're a working class guy, and you've got a [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2582.18s)]
*  job, you can't really just pick up and move. Also, there's there's big expenses to interstate moving. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2587.06s)]
*  You may not have that option. And so the whole bottom 50% of all of these major cities are [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2593.38s)]
*  essentially just stuck. Many of them would move if they could. They just don't have that option. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2600.1s)]
*  And it's a pretty terrible thing to do to people is to kind of make them, you know, like, I don't [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2606.74s)]
*  know exactly what the number is, how many people would leave these cities if they had the opportunity [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2612.98s)]
*  to but don't. But there's a lot. There's a lot of people who are essentially just trapped in these [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2617.38s)]
*  cities as they become objectively much worse places to live. And that is, you know, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2623.86s)]
*  that is a real albatross around the Democrats neck. I don't know exactly how they're going to [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2634.5s)]
*  get rid of like, how are they going to deal with the fact that it's like, yeah, you literally had [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2640.26s)]
*  full control of these areas and made them such nightmares that even the people they are wanting [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2646.26s)]
*  to leave because all things being equal, people tend to want to stay where they are. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2651.94s)]
*  All things being equal. You're like, I live here. I don't know. It's a pain in the ass to leave. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2656.82s)]
*  That thing's got to be pretty bad before they make people leave in mass like that. So rough, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2661.94s)]
*  rough time for the Dems. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2668.26s)]
*  show, which is sheath underwear. I've been telling you about them for years and years. Now the best [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2674.02s)]
*  pair of boxer briefs you will ever own, the most comfortable underwear I have ever put on my body [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2679.78s)]
*  and the only underwear that I ever wear at this point. Also, longtime sponsors of this show. So [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2685.6200000000003s)]
*  make sure you go support sheath. Sheath creates amazing underwear. And if you don't love them, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2691.2200000000003s)]
*  they have a 100% money back guarantee off your first pair. Plus they have an amazing line of [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2695.94s)]
*  underwear for women as well. So it's not just for us fellas. Go check them out at sheath underwear [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2701.78s)]
*  dot com and use the promo code problem for 20% off. They ship anywhere in the world. One more [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2706.66s)]
*  time, sheath underwear dot com promo code problem for 20% off. All right, let's get back into the [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2712.74s)]
*  show. I don't know. Any other thoughts on this one, Rob? I bet remote work also is a variable that [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2718.8199999999997s)]
*  you're no longer necessarily restricted to having to live in major cities in order to work your [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2724.42s)]
*  careers, which is also a result of a democratic or nationwide policy that was a little bit more [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2729.78s)]
*  sold by the Democrats through the COVID regime. Yes, that is a, that's a good point. A very good [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2737.46s)]
*  point. That is that that probably did have a huge impact on it too. Once you're not, once you're [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2744.7400000000002s)]
*  working from home, you have a lot more options of what you can do. And a lot of people who have jobs, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2748.5800000000004s)]
*  you know, jobs are a big thing that draws people into cities. And once you could have that job [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2754.5s)]
*  from somewhere else, it's, you could probably have a lot more, you know, a much bigger home for the [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2759.78s)]
*  same price or whatever. And a lot of people probably chose that. All right. Fair, fair point [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2764.9s)]
*  there, Rob. All right. Let's, let's move over to this appearance by Tom Homan. Am I saying his name [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2769.86s)]
*  right? Is it Homan? I think so. I think Homan, but Homan, Homan, the borders are, he really does, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2776.9s)]
*  his personality really is much more of the borders are than any name that you could come up with. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2784.18s)]
*  That seems like that should have been what his parents named him. Anyway, he was on officer [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2791.06s)]
*  hard ass. Yeah, that's literally be his name from birth. First name officer, last name, hard ass. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2795.54s)]
*  Well, look, he's a, he's a character for sure. And in some ways you can understand why he's an [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2800.8199999999997s)]
*  appealing character to be the borders are. I've always been a little bit of two minds about the guy, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2806.42s)]
*  you know, like I do, I do think that it's like the immigration policy under Joe Biden was beyond nuts. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2815.46s)]
*  I think it was suicidal and horrible. And I think you need kind of someone like this, maybe almost [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2823.06s)]
*  to clean up that mess. It also does like my libertarian spidey senses go off where I go, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2829.7000000000003s)]
*  this is everything about the beginning of a dystopian movie where this guy's in charge and [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2834.9s)]
*  is like, we're just going to clean up the problem. Okay. So there's, there's been a lot being made [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2839.78s)]
*  about the way that the Trump administration is going about some of these deportations. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2846.5s)]
*  And Homan was on this week on ABC to discuss, go ahead. If I can give a very short synopsis. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2851.6200000000003s)]
*  Essentially a number of suppose it Venezuela and gang members were flown to a jail in El Salvador, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2859.78s)]
*  which is seemingly probably one of the worst jails on the planet. Now, both sides of the story stink [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2867.54s)]
*  in that I don't think district judges should should be able to basically overrule the president. And [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2875.78s)]
*  that becomes an issue because for example, when Joe Biden was saying you're not allowed to evict [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2884.1800000000003s)]
*  tenants and then a court overruled him, I thought that that was illegal of Joe Biden. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2888.9s)]
*  And so there needs to be some sort of a mechanism to check the president. I think you almost need a [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2893.38s)]
*  secondary federal Supreme court that has multiple judges on it versus single courts and a single [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2897.62s)]
*  democratic judge. I believe this might've been a different case, but I think this guy was the guy [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2904.5s)]
*  who gave a soft sentencing to Ray Epps. So that's a little bit shady. And so I think single judges [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2909.38s)]
*  from democratic districts that were appointed by democratic presidents checking the current [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2920.1s)]
*  president, that doesn't make a lot of sense. And now there needs to be a mechanism [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2926.7400000000002s)]
*  for policing the president. If he is engaging in illegal behavior, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2931.38s)]
*  I think we need a different system than district judges. So I think it's a problem that a district [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2935.4599999999996s)]
*  judge is giving him a hard time about it. But what they did here of just taking people that they're [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2940.9799999999996s)]
*  saying are Venezuelan criminals or gang members, not even necessarily that they committed a crime [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2946.8999999999996s)]
*  other than being in a gang, and then just depositing them in a jail seemingly for life, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2952.2599999999998s)]
*  that doesn't seem like if you want to just ship them back to Venezuela and then Venezuela [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2957.14s)]
*  process them directly into jail, that's on Venezuela. That's not on us. But for us to just [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2961.46s)]
*  take people and never perform a court case and just putting them directly into a jail that's not [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2966.1s)]
*  even their country of origin. And I made a joke on a run your mouth that if you're in a gang, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2970.42s)]
*  you should get a tattoo that just says not a gang member. Because I was just saying these are for [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2975.06s)]
*  sure. I'm sure that there are some people that ended up in there just because of their tattoos. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2979.62s)]
*  And there's one lawyer claiming that a guy was a fan of soccer and just got the wrong tattoo. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2984.58s)]
*  We'll find out whether or not that is a true story or not a true story. If as a betting man, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2988.66s)]
*  just with the way the government operates, if you take 300 people without a court case and you just [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2994.2599999999998s)]
*  throw them into a jail, how many people you think are going to be innocent? I mean, if you had to [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=2998.34s)]
*  throw a number on it's going to be more than two. Do you want to take the over under on 25? I might [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3002.5s)]
*  even take the over on that. I'll probably take the under on 50. But I'm just saying that there's some [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3007.2999999999997s)]
*  people that just got sent to a jail in a country that they're not from for life directly from the [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3012.42s)]
*  United States government. And now this is the video of him defending his reason for doing this. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3018.5s)]
*  And I don't think it's much of a defense. All right. Yeah, let's let's play the video. That [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3024.34s)]
*  was a good setup. I'm joined now by the Trump administration's Borders are Tom Homan. Mr. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3028.1s)]
*  Homan, thank you very much for joining us. I want to start with something you you said last week [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3034.66s)]
*  that caused a big stir. You said I quote, I don't care what judges think. Now, I know you have since [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3040.34s)]
*  said that the administration will abide by court orders. We heard Donald Trump say the same thing. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3046.9s)]
*  So what do you mean when you say I don't care what judges think? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3051.86s)]
*  No, I don't care what that judges think. As far as this case, we're going to continue to arrest [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3057.06s)]
*  public safety threats and national security threats. We're going to continue to deport from [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3061.7000000000003s)]
*  United States. I understand this case is in litigation to the Alien Enemies Act and will abide by [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3065.38s)]
*  the court order as litigated. But my quote was despite what he thinks, we're going to keep [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3071.54s)]
*  targeting the worst of the worst of the worst. Here's another just interesting thing to note. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3077.54s)]
*  I've seen in the past where they'll use a law that hasn't been enforced for a long time. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3086.5s)]
*  And then you go, hey, that's kind of corrupt. We don't usually use this law. The last time the Alien [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3091.7000000000003s)]
*  Enemies law was used was when we interned the Japanese during World War II. And I don't think [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3096.42s)]
*  there's a lot of people that are pointing to that and going that was a good American policy. This is [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3101.7000000000003s)]
*  a good rule on the books. So when he goes, hey, there is a law in the books that gives us the [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3106.1800000000003s)]
*  authority to do so. From what I understand, and I think I read that in the New York Times, the last [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3111.94s)]
*  time that law was used was interning the Japanese. And I don't think people look at that now and go, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3117.3s)]
*  hey, that was very moral and just what we did during that time. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3121.86s)]
*  Yeah. And I must say that I really just cannot stand the kind of ridiculous, like kind of circular [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3126.2599999999998s)]
*  argument that it'll just be like, well, look, we're concerned that you're not getting the worst of the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3134.42s)]
*  worst here. And it's like, well, we're going to keep getting the worst of the worst. That's why [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3140.1s)]
*  we're targeting them because they're the worst of the worst. Straight just deporting someone. Go ahead. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3143.86s)]
*  If someone is stuck in the country illegally and you want to deport them, I think we should go after [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3148.5s)]
*  the criminals first. But I, and I've also said, just make them second-class citizens where they [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3152.82s)]
*  don't get benefits. They can't vote. I think everyone wins, but fine. You want to deport people [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3157.2200000000003s)]
*  back to their country of origin, go ahead and do so. You want to go after the criminals first? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3160.9s)]
*  Great. You can't just take people and deposit them into a jail without any sort of a court process [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3164.82s)]
*  whatsoever. That's just not what we're talking about here. And that's not even what you're saying [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3170.02s)]
*  when you go where we're going to continue to go after criminals and deport criminals. Great. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3174.02s)]
*  Deport criminals, but don't deposit them into a jail without a court case for life. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3177.86s)]
*  Yeah. No, look, if somebody's here illegally, then I think you have a right to force them to leave. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3183.1400000000003s)]
*  But yeah, when you're talking about sending them to a brutal prison in El Salvador, you're going [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3189.86s)]
*  to have to give me at least a little something like, we know this is a bad person because of X. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3195.38s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is paint your life. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3201.54s)]

*  United States, to the various flaws on the books. We're not making this up. The Alien [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3314.82s)]
*  Enemies Act was actually a federal law. It's a statute enacted by Congress and signed by the [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3319.38s)]
*  president. Now that's under litigation. But put that aside, we still have Title 8 authority to [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3323.62s)]
*  remove illegal amends for the United States and we're going to continue to concentrate on those [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3329.2200000000003s)]
*  who are the biggest threat to our communities, the public safety threats. But you're going to [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3333.2200000000003s)]
*  abide by court orders as long as, you know, and go through your appeals process, but you are not [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3337.06s)]
*  going to defy those orders. No. Okay. Let me ask you about the flights at issue here. The flights [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3342.98s)]
*  to El Salvador. You have said that everybody on those flights had ties to the Venezuelan gang, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3351.54s)]
*  Trende Agua, or to MS-13. Can you give me some background? Help me understand how these people [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3360.26s)]
*  ended up there. Are these people that were recently arrested? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3368.02s)]
*  There were some more. Some were in custody for a little bit. Some on that plane were Title 8 [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3373.38s)]
*  removals, which means they were order removed by the immigration judge. And some other were [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3379.7s)]
*  removed through the Alien Enemies Act. I think about 240 on that flight were Venezuelan gang [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3384.58s)]
*  members, TDA, and I think we had 21 MS-13 members and a couple of specific MS-13 cases. But as far [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3391.78s)]
*  as the Venezuelans on that flight, every single one, according to the information given to me from [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3403.78s)]
*  the field, are members of the TDA. And TDA has been determined to be terrorist organizations. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3407.86s)]
*  They are not classified as terrorists, so that plane removed 240 terrorists from the United States. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3415.3s)]
*  How do you determine, or how do your people in the field determine that somebody is a gang member? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3421.38s)]
*  There are various methods. I've noticed in the media, a lot of them don't have criminal [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3429.7799999999997s)]
*  histories. Well, a lot of gang members don't have criminal histories. Just like a lot of [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3434.42s)]
*  terrorists in this world, they're not in any terrorist database. We only know the information [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3437.7799999999997s)]
*  within databases based on, for instance, most terrorists we arrest that are identified as [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3442.98s)]
*  government are later identified through a Title III investigation or through an undercover operation. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3447.8599999999997s)]
*  They're not in any terrorist screening database. We know that. A lot of gang members, I started as [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3452.66s)]
*  a cop in 1984. Many gang members don't have a criminal history. We have a kind of social media, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3458.1s)]
*  we have a kind of surveillance techniques, we have to count on sworn statements from other gang [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3463.06s)]
*  members, we have to count on wiretaps in Title III. Everything involved with the criminal [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3467.2999999999997s)]
*  investigation has come into play. Just because someone hasn't been arrested and charged with a [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3472.9s)]
*  crime yet, doesn't mean they're a member of a gang. The obvious problem here is that it also [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3477.7000000000003s)]
*  doesn't mean they are a member of a gang. There is a presumption of innocence, even for people who [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3487.94s)]
*  are here illegally in the country, maybe not a presumption that they ought to be allowed to [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3494.7400000000002s)]
*  stay in the country. But in the same sense that we couldn't just throw them in an American prison, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3498.18s)]
*  the idea that we could just throw them in a foreign prison does, you know, it seems... [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3504.18s)]
*  And let me just say, well, this guy is good at being kind of like, like you said, officer hard [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3508.8999999999996s)]
*  ass. And if he's going to be like on a debate against somebody who's arguing for Joe Biden's [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3518.4199999999996s)]
*  loose immigration policy, he's probably going to say all the hardcore right things that people [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3524.58s)]
*  want to hear. There's major problems with this. And it's not just, look, there's the first and [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3529.7s)]
*  foremost, it's like, yeah, but like, what if you get the wrong person here? Like you said, Rob, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3537.86s)]
*  earlier, it's almost a guarantee that at some point you will. And that is the idea of like [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3544.1s)]
*  throwing somebody who doesn't deserve it into one of these prisons on its own is really horrible. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3550.82s)]
*  And then I would just say, sorry, and then you can go ahead, but then just number two, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3557.54s)]
*  why I think even like hardcore border restrictionists who support Donald Trump, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3562.5s)]
*  you should be a little bit concerned about this, because you got to think here, man, like, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3568.5800000000004s)]
*  as much as everybody always tells me Donald Trump is playing 4D chess, this is an area where you [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3573.54s)]
*  actually have to play 4D chess to some degree. And look, God forbid there is one or maybe a few [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3578.1s)]
*  of these cases becomes a high profile example of where you really fucked up. Like, let's say you [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3588.1s)]
*  actually got an American citizen here, you know what I mean? And like they whatever didn't have [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3594.3399999999997s)]
*  their papers or fucking they're all tatted up or whatever. Oh, my God, the nightmare that that's [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3598.8199999999997s)]
*  going to be toward the whole project of like deporting illegals and getting border security [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3605.62s)]
*  and all the things that we kind of all want to see. You got to be really careful with this one here, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3611.7s)]
*  man, because if you got like, I mean, the nightmare of the PR, if you like got an American [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3617.06s)]
*  citizen and had them tortured in one of these jails somewhere, that is really not going to be [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3623.38s)]
*  good. So yeah, this is this makes me a bit uncomfortable. I think it's something that [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3628.66s)]
*  Trump supporters would be wise to consider the risks associated with a policy like this. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3636.66s)]
*  And what he's really explaining here are suspect suspected gang members. Yes, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3643.7s)]
*  that would be until you go in front of a judge and you go, here's all the reasons we think this [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3648.8199999999997s)]
*  person is in this gang. And it's well, we actually bust him at the headquarters, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3653.54s)]
*  the other people testified, then fine. Now you've got evidence that the guy's in a gang. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3657.94s)]
*  And then the next layer to that is there. That's the problem with these terror designations is that [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3662.9s)]
*  once you label a group as being terrorists, and in this case, you know, I still think of terrorists [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3668.2599999999998s)]
*  as being they belong to Al Qaeda, they came into this country, and they're trying to blow up our [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3673.38s)]
*  buildings. I'd like to hear a little bit more clarification on why Venezuelan gang members are [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3677.38s)]
*  considered terrorists now. Now you might say that they're undermining our society through drug trade [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3684.02s)]
*  or that the Venezuelan government specifically wanted to deposit violent criminals here. But [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3688.58s)]
*  just the fact that you can throw in the terror designation and then go, well, you just belong to [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3694.26s)]
*  this group. Are you the DJ there? Do you deliver the what is that? At the beginning of this, he [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3698.82s)]
*  said affiliated with the group or ties to the group. So what does that mean? You were the [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3703.46s)]
*  accountant for them? Like, are your brothers in the gang or something like that? I mean, like, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3707.78s)]
*  what? Yeah, it's just very, look, it's very vague. I do. We got to wrap up here in a second. But I [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3712.34s)]
*  do think like this type of like, look, we've been saying this from before the election results came [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3717.2200000000003s)]
*  in. It's like, this is where things are going to get dicey. And this is going to be a real test for [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3725.94s)]
*  Donald Trump. And in the same way that look, again, I'll end on this. But I know I've made [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3731.62s)]
*  this point before. But, you know, Martin Luther King, okay, in the Civil Rights Act, the entire [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3739.7799999999997s)]
*  thing was performative. And I don't mean this is a knock necessarily. It's just a fact of history. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3747.06s)]
*  But like, they chose Birmingham, Alabama. They decided to go there because they knew what the [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3753.2999999999997s)]
*  reaction was going to be. And they knew they were going to get it on television. And there were [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3760.9s)]
*  millions of white Americans, including many who harbored prejudice of their own, like many people [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3766.5s)]
*  who still believed in segregation, many people who did not believe in the goals of the civil [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3773.54s)]
*  rights activists. But when they looked on TV, and saw, you know, black men in suits and ties [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3778.98s)]
*  getting chased down by like police dogs and fire hoses turned on them. They were just like, no, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3786.74s)]
*  we can't support that. Like we, we just can't support this level of violence against people. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3794.02s)]
*  Now it's much easier when you see people add it up, you know, from head to toe, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3798.9799999999996s)]
*  you don't even want to know like in the same way that Martin Luther King would have his guys wear [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3806.1s)]
*  suits and ties. There's a reason for that. And there's a reason why when you see a guy with face [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3809.4599999999996s)]
*  tattoos, you go, ah, he's a criminal of some sort, fucking throw him in jail, whatever, you know. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3813.22s)]
*  But look, in 2017, the even though it was all bullshit, and the facilities were built by Obama, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3818.2599999999998s)]
*  and half of the pictures were taken under Obama, the kids in cages thing really did [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3825.8599999999997s)]
*  radicalize and mobilize a lot of Trump's detractors. And it's just something that [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3832.1s)]
*  number one, whenever you're using violence, and even when it's state violence, you always want to [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3838.58s)]
*  be careful about it, because you don't want to fucking, you know, use it on people who don't [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3843.38s)]
*  deserve it, because that's a bad in and of itself. But it would also, you know, it's like, you got to [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3847.2999999999997s)]
*  really pay attention to like, how this is going to be perceived, and how this could end up backfiring. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3853.86s)]
*  And the truth is that as as furious as Americans were under about Joe Biden's immigration policies, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3861.2999999999997s)]
*  there is a level of violence that the American people will not tolerate. And you want to be [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3869.22s)]
*  really careful about flirting with that. All right, I do have to wrap up there. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3874.74s)]
*  Playing without commentary. But the next part is he does get questioned directly on what was the due [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3880.42s)]
*  process and essentially says there was no due process. But the Americans that have been victims [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3884.74s)]
*  of gang members, what due process did they have? Which, oh, and he says, he says, what did Larkin [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3890.1s)]
*  Rose, what due process did she have? And you're like, wait, what? That's not what due process is. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3895.14s)]
*  Like, that's not. And by the way, I believe her killers were convicted of murder. They did have due [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3900.02s)]
*  process. And they did. It's like, yes, no, murder victims don't get due process. It's the reason why [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3905.14s)]
*  we oppose murder. Just so we're all on the same page, right? Just throw Muslims in jail after 9-11 [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3910.42s)]
*  and go, well, what the victims of 9-11, what due process do they have? Well, the answer is we got [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3917.7s)]
*  to make sure that these are the people that actually perpetrated the crime. Otherwise, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3922.26s)]
*  for free people being in jail or innocent people being whether you're for the death penalty or not. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3927.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. There's there's good reasons on on both sides of that issue. Forget where you stand on [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3932.82s)]
*  that. We all recognize there is a difference between that and the state just killing somebody. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3938.0200000000004s)]
*  Like there's a difference between those two things. And we insist that there is due process, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3946.34s)]
*  that you get a conviction of this person before you do that. That's why it's a crime if you don't [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3950.66s)]
*  do that. You know what I'm saying? Like if again, so like if Larkin Rose, am I saying that name? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3956.02s)]
*  Right. That's her name. Right. Lincoln. Whatever. So I don't mean to be disrespectful. I'm just bad [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3960.74s)]
*  with names. But like had that person had she been convicted of murder in the first degree [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3966.2599999999998s)]
*  and then killed, it would be a different story than when she's just some innocent girl and gets [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3973.62s)]
*  killed. That's the whole point. So anyway, like yes, to your point, it's just a non-answer. He [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3978.82s)]
*  essentially just had no answer for that. And essentially the answer is that they don't get [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3984.26s)]
*  due process. That is an issue. All right. Got to wrap up there. Catch you guys next time. See you [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3988.02s)]
*  in Boston this weekend. ComicDaveSmith.com for those tickets. Catch you then. Peace. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXxhrcHLCRI&t=3993.2200000000003s)]
