*  I guess when you say it like that it sounds like it's really not that exciting and we're just old men who may or may [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=123.60000000000001s)]

*  To come see me and Rob in a city near you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=158.84s)]
*  All right. So I did I [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=164.12s)]
*  Wanted to say something about this, although I don't exactly I don't know if you've had this feeling Rob, but I have [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  so [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  this year, I [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=176.28s)]
*  Think perhaps last year [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  2023 was the first [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=181.52s)]
*  Holiday season since kovat where Fauci was not recommending you don't have a holiday [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  But 2020 2021 and 2022 for sure. They were all recommending you don't do your normal holiday thing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=193.4s)]
*  Very it's as much as we were covering the whole thing as it happened [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  It's still so bizarre when I just say that out loud. It just feels so weird to me something out of like a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=206.36s)]
*  Like an episode of the Twilight Zone or something like that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  It just seems so bizarre that that would actually like really government officials are telling you not to celebrate the holidays with your family [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=215.4s)]
*  But I remember I've kind of thought about this every every holiday season since kovat that it is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=222.88s)]
*  It just like how important that is for people to have that time, you know, it's kind of seems silly when you're a kid [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=231.56s)]
*  I think a lot of times it just is like oh [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=238.64s)]
*  It's the time of year when you get presents or whatever [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  But like as as an adult particularly one with little kids, it's just the most important thing [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=242.56s)]
*  It's like everything else you do for the year is so you can have these moments with people you love and these celebrations [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=248.22s)]
*  And I just couldn't help but thinking about that. I remember feeling the same way last year [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=254.26s)]
*  but sitting here and going like man how many Americans actually listened to those people and did not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=260.06s)]
*  You know like do this thing that human beings need to do [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=267.7s)]
*  Which is like celebrate and have rituals and have community and family and friends and all of these things and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  Like what a crime it is to rob people of that the years of their lives [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  Like it's just I don't know. I'm still as angry as ever about everybody who participated in the kovat insanity [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=285.98s)]
*  Anyway, just wanted to open up by saying that people need to celebrate people need [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=293.06s)]
*  Holidays that's every civilization that's ever existed has had them even really really poor [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=298.86s)]
*  civilizations from thousands of years ago would have like [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  Feasts where they would do like these crazy things because you just need that you need something to look forward to you need to be [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  around your community and your friends and your family and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=313.12s)]
*  It's still so goddamn crazy to me that they actually convince people not to do that for years [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=317.42s)]
*  And that's why we need to prosecute Fauci [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  Because the masses need to learn that there are no points in heaven for fake government compliance by fake government compliance [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=325.78s)]
*  I mean complying with government feeling like you're doing something for the greater good [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  Only to find out that you were rotting in your apartment for absolutely no reason whatsoever [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  And that listening to government does not give you points in heaven. Oh [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=340.74s)]
*  Man, that's gonna be so hard for some people when they get up there and find that out. Wait, what? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=345.5s)]
*  Fouch where's Fauci and God's gotta be like Fauci's not here. He's somewhere else [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=351.5s)]
*  He means supporting the local abortion clinic and forced welfare distribution that left us all more poor and supportive foreign wars [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=357.54s)]
*  Wasn't what I was supposed to be doing with my life [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  Man it is it is something to to look back on and there is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=369.7s)]
*  There's I [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=376.5s)]
*  Think one of the things that was exposed over the last few years is that you know, it's not just [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=378.62s)]
*  That obviously like the levels of government corruption or like the levels that government corruption had infiltrated the medical [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=386.7s)]
*  Establishment was I think one of the big lessons for a lot of people and this is something that really [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=394.58s)]
*  Red-pilled a lot of people like a lot of people really woke up to this and and in some ways I think [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=400.58s)]
*  Me and you were several steps ahead of people in the in some ways [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=408.5s)]
*  I'm saying that like, you know, you kind of we were already operating under the belief structure that okay [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=413.5s)]
*  the corporate media are a bunch of liars and the government's a bunch of criminals and that these people are like the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=419.78s)]
*  destroyers of civilization rather than the the helpers of civilization, but [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=425.46s)]
*  It is something that will you know, as I've said many times we'll spend the next [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=431.3s)]
*  Two decades at least figuring out what the impact of all of that really is [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=436.18s)]
*  but [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=442.7s)]
*  One of the things that was also exposed [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=444.9s)]
*  was just [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=448.38s)]
*  kind of how sick [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=450.14s)]
*  dominant liberal progressive culture is in this country and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=452.94s)]
*  There's a couple of clips that we have for today's show and I did think that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=457.74s)]
*  They were kind of getting at that in some way like that. It's like, oh, there's this whole, you know because [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=462.41999999999996s)]
*  the whatever you might call it like liberal progressive [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=469.09999999999997s)]
*  Establishment types have been so dominant for so long [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=474.02s)]
*  They have been the force in American culture and lots of this was because for throughout our entire childhood Rob [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=478.78s)]
*  they [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=486.65999999999997s)]
*  Ran the TV and the TV dictated so much about culture [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=487.78s)]
*  I mean the television was all done in LA and New York and so why is it that every single show? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=492.26s)]
*  You ever grew up watching like if you're around our age the shows were like [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=499.5s)]
*  Seinfeld and friends and shows like this. They were all about people who lived in big cities lived in very liberal environments [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=504.5s)]
*  That's just always the dominant, you know Fox News [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=511.9s)]
*  Stood out because Fox News was like the one cable news channel that wasn't [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=515.3s)]
*  Involved in that it was you know the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=521.62s)]
*  The exception they were the Black History Month of television, you know, but everything else was liberal [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=525.02s)]
*  the liberal world and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=532.5s)]
*  That was true for a very long time for a very long time [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=535.02s)]
*  It was like there was right-wing talk radio and there was Fox News and they were all very controlled [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=537.54s)]
*  Conservatism ink outlets who also themselves accepted much of the progressive worldview, but [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=543.54s)]
*  Because of that it's very easy for people to notice when there's a sick culture on the right [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=551.62s)]
*  The the dominant kind of liberal culture is something that I think people always just took for granted as like oh [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=559.4599999999999s)]
*  That's just the normal way to be I think a lot of that's been exposed over the last few years as well [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=566.14s)]
*  There's some I don't even know if I can quite quantify it [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=571.38s)]
*  But there is some sort of a feel-good feeling when you're on board with the liberals that you just feel like you've earned [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=574.86s)]
*  Maybe it's just some sort of level of acceptance or status and the one time I had an experience with this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=581.5s)]
*  You know in the archives I used to do a show called Rob's newsroom [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=586.7s)]
*  we did a bunch of really funny sketches on it and [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=589.46s)]
*  One of the ones that we did was I think it was when the tree [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=591.9s)]
*  There was some incident where a black guy got killed and I built the don't shoot suit [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=594.58s)]
*  Which was a suit with black hands that always had the hands in the air so that cops couldn't shoot you that was that was [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=598.3s)]
*  That was that was that was the joke of it and the arts and crafts and me I built the thing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  It looked great my friend menu and did it [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=608.0999999999999s)]
*  But I had this moment where I was going to Michaels and I was trying to get black paint for the hands [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=610.0999999999999s)]
*  And I'm talking to the the black lady and I'm all excited because I'm doing this thing [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=614.66s)]
*  That's like very liberal of you know, don't shoot black people. It shouldn't be very liberal, but at the time it was [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  It's a far-left position yeah, and so, you know, I have this feel-good feeling of oh wow, everyone's gonna like me on this one [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=625.18s)]
*  I'm not telling that we shouldn't have government socialized health care and all the things that you almost curl up because people think oh if you [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  Talk about that government shouldn't get involved and not steal our wealth pretending like there's global warming [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=638.18s)]
*  You know what? I mean? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=643.06s)]
*  Like there's something that you got to fight up against people whereas if you just said hey [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=643.54s)]
*  We should all care about global warming then everyone accepts he gives you a nice big hug and you get to feel good [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=647.26s)]
*  So I remember I for one day I had that feeling until I'm having this moment with this lady and she's picking out the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=652.82s)]
*  Pain and she hands me some black paint and I go no I need more of like a human black [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=658.22s)]
*  She just looked at me like excuse me and I was like no that's like for the sketch [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=665.7800000000001s)]
*  It's like good for your kind of people. I was like, you know what? I'll just find it. Thank you for your time [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=669.74s)]
*  It's not what you think we're making it's so cops don't shoot black people it's [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=676.38s)]
*  But yeah, well look man it is [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=681.46s)]
*  There's a real [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=685.38s)]
*  human desire to be like accepted and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=687.58s)]
*  You know, I mean, this is like there's something to it [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=692.26s)]
*  And that's I think that's why so many people fall in line and I think that's kind of what the elites tap into [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=695.58s)]
*  Is that it's so much it's so much easier to just go. Oh as long as I pay my taxes and I [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=702.06s)]
*  Advance the ideas of forced wealth [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=707.58s)]
*  Redistribution I'm being a kind person. I don't need religion in my life. I don't need family, but that's me caring for the poor [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=709.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't have to think about any of these issues. Like that's kind of the sale of government is hey [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=715.9000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna come in as the nice people and we're gonna make sure that the poor are taken care of and so as long as you [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=720.46s)]
*  Support us in doing so then you're a nice person as well [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=725.98s)]
*  And that's a very easy worldview for a for a lot of people to accept [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=728.7s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's right and to kind of remove themselves [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=733.26s)]
*  From the ugliness of what you're actually advocating when you advocate for that stuff that it's like, you know, there's um, you know [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=737.7s)]
*  There are all these videos [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=744.7s)]
*  online [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=746.74s)]
*  You know that goes super viral in like, you know, there's um [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=748.86s)]
*  Like kind of the I forget what they call it [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=754.42s)]
*  I think they call it the red pill community sometimes which I don't like because we were using that term first [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=756.9s)]
*  But like the Mano sphere guys who are the gay Mexicans took it over. Yes [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=762.18s)]
*  but like there's [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=769.1s)]
*  You know, like I've I've I had Andrew Wilson on the show before it was a very good episode [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=771.3s)]
*  I thought but he's like one of the guys who does those podcasts there's and I did the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=776.9s)]
*  Fresh and fit podcast with Myron. I enjoyed doing the show very much [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=784.5s)]
*  But I did it like just me and him talking it wasn't like, you know arguing with club chicks [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=789.24s)]
*  Which is what they're you know, I've gotten kind of famous for but one of the things that was interesting [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=794.48s)]
*  That I have seen that are like viral clips that come out of those shows [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=799.88s)]
*  Is that they'll be? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=804.0400000000001s)]
*  You know whatever like some some 20 year old chick today and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=808.2s)]
*  They'll they'll have this attitude where they're like, oh, I don't we don't need men like men are obsolete [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=812.2s)]
*  And then it's interesting when they get confronted by these guys and they're like, oh so like but what do you do if like someone? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=817.48s)]
*  Breaks into your house and they're like, well, I call the cops and you know [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=824.48s)]
*  You're like and you figure out that you're like, you know, you could say you don't need men but like [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=828.2s)]
*  You're only one degree separated is really all that's happening [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=834.12s)]
*  Is that instead of like a man directly in your life you call a group of men to come do it? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=837.6400000000001s)]
*  But the road you drive on was paved by men and the building you live in was built by man and the bed [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=842.92s)]
*  It's just but there's just something that's interesting about the mindset where that 20 year old chick could say I don't need a man and [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=847.6s)]
*  kind of on some [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=855.24s)]
*  Superficial level that could sound plausibly true to her like what you know what I mean? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=857.68s)]
*  Like no, I don't need a man now if you really think about it [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=862.48s)]
*  You're like, well, no, but you do and you do at every bit as much as anyone every any woman ever has maybe even more [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=864.9s)]
*  But you're just a little bit removed from it and there's something kind of similar to that with people who just advocate for government [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=871.9599999999999s)]
*  All the time where it's like you may not feel like you're being violent and in some sense you're not [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=878.8399999999999s)]
*  But you certainly are advocating for it and you certainly do need it in order to sustain this [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=885.2399999999999s)]
*  worldview that you have and so I think of course that leads toward [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=892.0s)]
*  Kind of a sick culture because all of that stuff when you're saying you're advocating for more government intervention or any of that stuff [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=897.48s)]
*  What you're advocating for is more violence [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=904.44s)]
*  By definition, that's what government is and increasing it is just increasing the amount of violence in people's lives [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=907.4s)]
*  Everything about government is violence, you know, every single rule is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=914.64s)]
*  Underwritten by the threat of force. That's how the whole thing works [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=920.12s)]
*  It's not anything that the government does there's never like it's never a conversation [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=924.3199999999999s)]
*  It's there's a there's a gun pointed at you, you know [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=930.1999999999999s)]
*  Whether it's the whether it's just paying the fucking tag paying property taxes or something like that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  If I don't pay my property taxes men with guns will come and take my house away from me [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=938.64s)]
*  And if I try to resist to them, they will shoot me. That's kind of the basic [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=943.56s)]
*  Foundational [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=948.22s)]
*  Truth about what the government is and anyway, it's just interesting to me to see a lot of this now [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=951.02s)]
*  But so there's a couple clips here. This this first one I want to play [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=956.22s)]
*  As this is an older clip [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=959.58s)]
*  and it's about a show that uh that I used to watch and really love [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=962.58s)]
*  Which is Homeland and I just saw that a chief nerd had posted the video [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=969.22s)]
*  Yesterday and it's been blowing up and going super viral. I mean he's got like 10 million views on his post from it [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=976.82s)]
*  It's from 2018 [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=983.14s)]
*  But it's a clip of Claire Danes and she's talking about the show Homeland on [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=985.3000000000001s)]
*  on the Colbert report and or I'm sorry not on the Colbert report on the on the late show and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know. Did you watch Homeland by the way rub [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=997.86s)]
*  Loved Homeland loved Homeland. Yeah, it was like it was like 24, you know [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1000.78s)]
*  Even if even if you knew all of everything we knew about the government and CIA you could love and watch that show [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1005.82s)]
*  I'll say it was a slightly updated [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1011.58s)]
*  24 because it wasn't 24 still came out in the war on terriers by the way [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1014.34s)]
*  I got to admit I loved 24 to loved it [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1019.1800000000001s)]
*  Even though I know it was just the 24 the level of propaganda with 24 was nuts [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1021.6600000000001s)]
*  It was always like no the government torturers are the good guys and you just have to torture and people who don't [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1025.98s)]
*  Understand that you have to torture are just wimps, you know, but Jack Bauer was the shit so I don't care [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1031.7s)]
*  I can still enjoy a show [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1036.7s)]
*  but [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1038.58s)]
*  anyway in [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1040.1s)]
*  Homeland they did a little bit better of a job of dealing with the fact particularly in the later seasons that they were like [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1041.34s)]
*  You know, there's a whole lot of people completely opposed to what we do and then her character even was like, yeah [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1046.98s)]
*  I think we are wrong for doing all this shit [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1052.3s)]
*  So like it was but it was it wasn't Israeli show by the way that got remade in America [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1054.2s)]
*  but I I loved the show and I thought the the opening like [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1060.9399999999998s)]
*  Whatever it was like 10 15 minutes into the first episode [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1067.54s)]
*  When you kind of figured out what the plot for the show was and I remember as I watched that just thinking that might be [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1071.06s)]
*  The best plot I've ever seen for a show like laid out [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1077.5s)]
*  Which I don't know. I guess I'm not spoiling anything. I could tell say it right. Okay here [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1081.8999999999999s)]
*  Spoiler alert if you haven't seen season one episode one of [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1086.5800000000002s)]
*  Homeland but the way the show starts is that it starts with her in I can't remember what Middle Eastern country [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1090.14s)]
*  But she's in the Middle East [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1099.14s)]
*  She's a CIA operative and she's trying to get into this prison to talk to one of her sources [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1101.0600000000002s)]
*  Who's about to be executed and she gets in and he whispers in her ear something [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1106.22s)]
*  she got the information she needed to out of them and then it cuts to like months later and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1110.6000000000001s)]
*  They're back in at the CIA and they've rescued an American POW [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1116.0600000000002s)]
*  Who they believe didn't exist they thought there were no American POWs [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1121.5800000000002s)]
*  But they found one and then what you find out is that her source had told her that an American [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1125.18s)]
*  POW had been turned against America and was working for al-qaeda [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1131.9s)]
*  And so then the whole show is basically that she didn't believe him because she's like there is no POW [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1136.0600000000002s)]
*  But then they find out there is and it's him and he's been turned [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1140.5s)]
*  Anyway, just I thought the show was great [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1143.5s)]
*  There's really was no need for me to get into this detail [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1146.38s)]
*  plot, but anyway [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1149.66s)]
*  Alright guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is monetary medals [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1151.54s)]

*  Okay [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1224.58s)]

*  Do you do this every season where you go get to spend some time with some actual spies? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1229.3s)]
*  We do it's like the coolest part of my job sets that up who calls the CIA goes [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1233.82s)]

*  Passed away a number of years ago [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1244.78s)]
*  But his dad was in the CIA and his cousin was a mentee of his father's and was also in the CIA a very [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1246.6999999999998s)]
*  Accomplished person there and he recently retired but in his retirement he curates this week-long [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1252.94s)]
*  spy camp for us [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1258.94s)]
*  producers and writers and really yeah, is it like yeah, so we park ourselves in a club in Georgetown and talk to like [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1261.46s)]
*  real [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1269.5800000000002s)]
*  Spooks and you know people in the intelligence community and and the State Department and journalists and people who really what do they tell you? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1270.98s)]
*  Like what's the most surprising thing that they've told you about their jobs or something you would need to know well every year [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1278.46s)]
*  It's different right we've been at it for a while and and the climate has been has changed [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1283.56s)]
*  but this year it was all about you know, the distrust between the administration and the intelligence world and [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1288.54s)]
*  And the intelligence community was suddenly kind of allying itself with journalists, which [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1294.78s)]
*  Start shooting this [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1300.6200000000001s)]
*  To choose the way Colbert gets visibly nervous and changes the subject immediately [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1303.62s)]
*  Is goddamn hilarious? I mean he actually he physically moves back from her as she's saying this [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1311.26s)]
*  Anyway, hey, so what's the most interesting thing you've learned about the job? Well, it's interesting [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1320.1399999999999s)]
*  You see they're actually at war with the president and they're completely embedded in the corporate media [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1324.56s)]
*  Anyway [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1328.8s)]
*  Anyway, let's talk about something else [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1331.0s)]
*  But isn't that first of all just a little bit of a window? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1332.4399999999998s)]
*  into this entire world and how crazy it is is number one that they have a long-standing [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1337.48s)]
*  relationship with [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1344.76s)]
*  Hollywood and with producers and stuff like this and that they're the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1346.3999999999999s)]
*  Intelligence agencies are they're not doing this just like out of the kindness of their own heart [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1351.8799999999999s)]
*  They're not just like oh [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1356.3999999999999s)]
*  This will be kind of like a take your kid to workday type thing where we all show you about what the CIA does [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1357.24s)]
*  It's like oh if there's gonna be a movie or a show made about the CIA [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1362.3999999999999s)]
*  We want to make sure that we have some hand in crafting how this is gonna be explained [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1367.6399999999999s)]
*  And then she just throws out that you know things have really changed now, which I mean, okay [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1374.08s)]
*  She may have said it in slightly nicer language [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1379.4799999999998s)]
*  But she was basically like, you know things are different now because the CIA is at war with the president and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1381.9199999999998s)]
*  So what and so what are they doing? Oh, they're working with [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1389.1599999999999s)]
*  journalists [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1394.9599999999998s)]
*  in a very close relationship [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1396.8s)]
*  To help their effort against the president [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1399.9199999999998s)]
*  Isn't it just wild I'm sorry no matter who you are [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1406.12s)]
*  No matter what your politics are to see that and then like again [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1409.6799999999998s)]
*  Obviously, there's a little bit of confirmation bias here because this is the shit me and you talk about all the time [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1414.9599999999998s)]
*  But when you see that and then go oh and the entire corporate media hates [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1419.24s)]
*  Donald Trump's guts in a way that no other president has ever been hated and then you just get fed the information [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1425.12s)]
*  that the CIA [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1432.56s)]
*  Who allegedly works for the president mind you is very involved in that [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1435.36s)]
*  What a shocker, you know [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1441.8799999999999s)]
*  But the fact that this could come out and that [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1443.44s)]
*  Colbert's reaction wouldn't be to ask like a follow-up question on that or want to hear. Whoa, that's really interesting [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1445.9199999999998s)]
*  Isn't it who isn't interested by that? Who doesn't think that's like? Whoa, wait, what the fuck you talk? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1453.2s)]
*  You're telling me something that's so much cooler than the show that you're talking about is that which by the way [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1459.08s)]
*  I'm on record. I think was a really cool show [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1464.08s)]
*  Anyway, I just thought this moment was so crazy and it's great that it's going super viral right now [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1466.56s)]
*  It's also it's such a fun insight into people [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1471.72s)]
*  like I because you know [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1474.56s)]
*  She's just talking about her actor process of trying to meet the individuals and how she absorbs some of the language and the energy [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1475.98s)]
*  Of the spooks so that she can better replicate on camera. I don't think Claire Danes worked at the CIA [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1482.22s)]
*  I think she's a great actress and so she's just describing her process of her art [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1487.52s)]
*  Now for the spooks, it's funny what you might accidentally say just hanging out at a party [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1492.56s)]
*  It's a you ever see the movie the big short. There's that scene where yes the great movie [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1497.92s)]
*  Yeah, and there's that scene where I they're talking about like the mortgages that they're doing for people that can't afford them and [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1502.96s)]
*  and they ask [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1510.16s)]
*  Why they're being told that he goes, oh, I think they're just bragging [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1513.04s)]
*  There's something about like sociopaths that you know, we go why that he goes it's a great scene and he goes why are they confessing? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1516.04s)]
*  And he goes they're not confessing they're bragging [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1522.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. Yeah, there is something about that. And so the CIA people hanging out at this party [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1526.64s)]
*  I don't know why my camera just went down. I'll fix that in a second. Can you still hear me? I can hear you [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1531.56s)]
*  Yes, all right. Yeah, I'll fix that a second [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1536.8s)]
*  I it's essentially you're hanging out a party and your your life is power and in your little social circle [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1538.3s)]
*  It's about what you can execute on [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1544.48s)]
*  so the idea of hey this administration is not like the Bush administration and we don't just have a [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1545.96s)]
*  Free pass to go do what we want to do [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1550.8s)]
*  And so now we got a fight for our agenda a little bit more of what we think is important for national security [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1552.76s)]
*  I could see why you would just say that openly and then people like us would go hey [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1557.96s)]
*  You guys oversaw a disaster for the last decade and no you shouldn't just be allowed to drone kids [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1563.68s)]
*  Yeah, no 100% it reminds me a bit of [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1569.96s)]
*  Like the the project Veritas [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1574.08s)]
*  style [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1577.0s)]
*  Reporting which I know what's his name James O'Keefe. I think he's not with them anymore [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1578.32s)]
*  I can't remember the name of his his new company, but he's still doing like that type of [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1583.04s)]
*  You know guerrilla journalism for anybody who doesn't know I'm sure most of the audience have seen their videos [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1588.12s)]
*  But they'll do things where they get it's almost always a date [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1593.1599999999999s)]
*  Like it's it'll either be a guy. I think it's worse than that. I think sometimes it's not even a first date [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1597.28s)]
*  I think it's a after after they slept and there was the time of some dudes life [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1602.88s)]
*  And so he's he's hoping for a round two and he'll school all the beams the beans to try and pretend like wait [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1607.48s)]
*  You're interested what I do at work. No, I'm so [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1613.8000000000002s)]
*  The problem with that obviously is that because there is an issue with that type of journalism, which is that what you get? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1616.92s)]
*  Oftentimes are dudes who are trying to kind of brag their way into getting laid [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1624.92s)]
*  So they're always like playing up how important their job is [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  But there there's no question that there is also a dynamic of what you're talking about there [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1634.96s)]
*  where you just get a couple drinks in these guys and they kind of want to brag about how you know, like [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1640.3400000000001s)]
*  Whatever they're just if they're just some guy who works on a show like works on Don Lemmon's show at CNN [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1646.44s)]
*  But they're real quick to tell you like yeah [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1653.04s)]
*  Our goal is to bring Donald Trump down and that's what we've been trying to do and we're trying to we're trying to push the [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1655.32s)]
*  COVID vaccine because we're trying to get that in as many arms as possible [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1660.76s)]
*  but we're gonna pivot to climate change pretty soon and but and they'll just say it straight up and just let them know and [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  It's it is that that scene in the big short isn't a perfect like [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1670.28s)]
*  Thing to mention because it isn't they're not confessing. They're bragging [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1675.8400000000001s)]
*  They're bragging about how it is that they can get away with this stuff [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1680.28s)]
*  another example of that that I I think of is the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1685.48s)]
*  the [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1690.1200000000001s)]
*  when Michael [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1691.28s)]
*  Haste fasting I'm saying that right the he was the journalist who died in that very suspicious car crash [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1692.8s)]
*  But he was a journalist for Rolling Stone and he published the piece that got [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1699.6s)]
*  General McChrystal fired or admit forced to resign. However, it was that he left but [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1703.84s)]
*  Part of that was that they just started drinking with them at the bar [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1710.24s)]
*  Pretty soon that general McChrystal just couldn't stop bragging about how much he fucking hated Obama and how much Obama was a rookie and didn't [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1714.3600000000001s)]
*  Know what he was talking about and he tricked him and blah and all this stuff and you that one [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1722.24s)]
*  Was really crazy because you would certainly you would think like a four-star general would be really guarded [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1727.3600000000001s)]
*  about ever trashing the commander-in-chief around a [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1735.0s)]
*  Journalist, you know what I mean? Like it's like he's there too [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1739.3200000000002s)]
*  Now I think part of the thing is that he reported for Rolling Stone [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1743.3200000000002s)]
*  And so they just didn't they didn't treat him like he was like a Washington Post New York Times journalist [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1746.5600000000002s)]
*  They were like, it's the Rolling Stone guy [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1752.1200000000001s)]
*  But the idea that you would ever lower your guard enough as a four-star general trashing the commander-in-chief [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1754.8000000000002s)]
*  to a reporter, you know, but it's also it's there's something in there about like [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1762.88s)]
*  Human psychology and the fact that when these people [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1768.44s)]
*  Get these positions they are [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1773.04s)]
*  They're kind of drunk on their own sense of importance, you know [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1775.92s)]
*  That's just kind of the way it works and this was something that I really saw firsthand [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1779.84s)]
*  During my time at cable news was that it is like [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1787.24s)]
*  Like the currency there is your own self-importance and [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1792.96s)]
*  I'm sure that's true to some degree in every field [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1798.48s)]
*  But particularly in the cable news corporate media world [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1801.28s)]
*  You would just see a lot of this where like people are bragging about who they had lunch with or who they hung out with at a [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1805.28s)]
*  cocktail party and it's always like, you know something like I [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1812.0800000000002s)]
*  Remember I dick Cheney's chief of staff was always the one that I used because that was specifically [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1816.48s)]
*  What someone there bragged to me about that? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1821.36s)]
*  They had just gotten off the phone with dick Cheney's chief of staff and I remember and this is like this was Donald Trump was president [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1824.3999999999999s)]
*  already, so this was [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1831.04s)]
*  After eight years of Obama and into I don't remember exactly what year it was, but it was like [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1833.52s)]
*  2017 maybe something like that. So it was already like bragging about dick Cheney's guy like [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1838.24s)]
*  What that old guy who was wrong about everything but it's like [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1845.52s)]
*  To them it was still like dude [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1849.68s)]
*  That was the vice president's chief of staff and I just got off the phone with him. And so now [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1851.36s)]
*  There's this weird incentives where then you're kind of like well [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1857.84s)]
*  I'm gonna go say exactly what he told me to the camera because I have some feeling like I got an inside scoop [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1861.36s)]
*  That I can share with everybody and then that also makes dick Cheney's chief of staff want to get back on the phone with you [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1868.32s)]
*  Because what's actually happened here? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1874.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, you're distracted with the bells and whistles of like aren't I an important person? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1876.88s)]
*  I know important people and they take time out to give me a phone call [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1880.96s)]
*  But what that guy just figured out is he has a puppet in the media now [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1884.8000000000002s)]
*  Who he can totally like use your mouth to say whatever he wants to say to the American people [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1888.3200000000002s)]
*  Which of course in this case was we sure do got to go throw Bashar al overthrow Bashar al-assad in Syria [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1894.0s)]
*  That's that's what the conversation was about at the time and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1901.0400000000002s)]
*  By the way, it's [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1903.92s)]
*  They ultimately ended up getting that done, but not not at the time and not for a while. But anyway, so it's just [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1905.52s)]
*  What a like it's [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1913.04s)]
*  again, you have these like [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1915.3600000000001s)]
*  You've got this the the worldview that has been dominant in the corporate [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1919.1200000000001s)]
*  You know tv world has been for a while that if you were like if I were to judge [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1925.28s)]
*  Come and here's what's really wild about it. Okay, let's just say I was on [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1931.68s)]
*  The late show with Stephen Colbert. I don't i'm not holding my breath [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1935.8400000000001s)]
*  But let's just say hypothetically right and he was interviewing me. Let's say me and you go on rob [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1940.8s)]
*  And he was interviewing us about like what our worldview is and what part of the problem is about and what we believe [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1946.24s)]
*  And we were to say well like [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1954.0s)]
*  We essentially believe that [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1957.28s)]
*  The cia has for many many decades been embedded in the [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1960.0s)]
*  in major newspapers and in television news and all of this stuff and that they [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1964.8799999999999s)]
*  For their own reasons, but for their own agenda [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1970.32s)]
*  Have been attempting to propagandize the american people to believe in certain things that are in their interest [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1973.84s)]
*  But not necessarily in the interest of the american people and many times [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1981.04s)]
*  Quite clearly a lot of people believe that [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1984.8799999999999s)]
*  Many times, uh quite clearly against the interests of the american people [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1986.88s)]
*  I mean you could already see that this would we would be laughed out of the room [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1992.0s)]
*  But he would mock us he'd make some joke about it. The audience would clap like seals for him [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=1996.16s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Like it's very easy for them to go like oh these conspiracy theorists [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2001.44s)]
*  Oh, this is so this is these are a bunch of kooks [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2006.8000000000002s)]
*  And yet here you have somebody who was on the biggest cia show [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2010.3200000000002s)]
*  You ask her what field research she did to prepare for that role and she is just telling you that this is what they're openly telling us [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2016.72s)]
*  That they're at war with the president and they're using the corporate media in order to hurt him [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2025.6000000000001s)]
*  And not only do you not ever address like wow, that's that's [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2031.3600000000001s)]
*  By the definition of the word. That's quite a conspiracy that you are exposing here on this show [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2036.64s)]
*  But it just it's like it goes in one ear out the other ear and that will never [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2043.04s)]
*  even have [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2048.96s)]
*  the tiniest effect [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2051.04s)]
*  On how colbert talks about trump going forward [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2053.76s)]
*  like [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2057.12s)]
*  This is why also it's very hard for people to believe that like he's not in on a conspiracy or something like that [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2058.32s)]
*  Now, I don't necessarily think that's the case. I think it is [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2064.4s)]
*  um, it's incredible what incentives can do to people [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2067.36s)]
*  and how much how [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2072.08s)]
*  How easily people can rationalize? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2074.56s)]
*  A way the way they're being manipulated by their incentives. It's something we all got to guard against if i'm being completely honest, but [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2077.92s)]
*  The wild thing is that this could just be acknowledged [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2084.88s)]
*  on steven colbert's show [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2089.12s)]
*  And then it's like oh that doesn't have an impact on anything [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2091.92s)]
*  ever [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2095.92s)]
*  you know like [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2097.04s)]
*  It'd be like i'm trying to think of the example but like if I if I did find out [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2098.72s)]
*  that [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2106.0s)]
*  I I don't even know like if you if you found out that like um, you know your your favorite [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2107.68s)]
*  You know free market economist was in fact hired by the cia and was part of [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2114.32s)]
*  An operation to get people to believe in this stuff and you just found that out [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2121.44s)]
*  You'd think that would at least have an imp like you'd have to like oh i'm gonna have to go grapple with that for a while [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2126.16s)]
*  Like what does that mean exactly? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2131.36s)]
*  whereas like you [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2133.36s)]
*  Steven colbert here is this it's tearing apart his entire existence [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2135.12s)]
*  Like when you really think about what she's saying there she's going hey the cia is okay [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2139.84s)]
*  i'm using the term at war she didn't say at war but [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2145.7599999999998s)]
*  She basically did say that there's this new dynamic now where the cia is working against the president who by the way [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2149.6s)]
*  They work for they they are part of the executive branch [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2156.08s)]
*  They are they are to report to the president who is their commander in chief [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2160.96s)]
*  And you're saying oh, no, they're working against him and they're using the media to do that. And who is stephen colbert exactly? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2165.92s)]
*  What role is he playing in this game? Well, you're like right at the center of that [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2173.2799999999997s)]
*  You're one of the late night hosts who are trashing donald trump every single chance you get [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2177.2799999999997s)]
*  And for to hear this and have it have no impact on you [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2182.56s)]

*  Luigi mangioni dropped his extradition fight and was flown from pennsylvania. All right, that's that's it essentially. That's all we wanted to play [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2308.32s)]
*  So he again [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2317.52s)]
*  Look, i'm not trying to like make [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2319.68s)]
*  More of this than is justified [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2322.72s)]
*  um, it's just that [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2325.12s)]
*  You have like I I guess what's running together to me? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2327.44s)]
*  I understand these are just like random clips one of them's from 2018 one of them's from recently [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2331.04s)]
*  i'm not trying to overplay my my hand here, but [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2335.04s)]
*  There is something interesting to me that within kind of like what we're looking at here [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2340.8s)]
*  In both cases are the the comedy shows of the liberal establishment [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2346.56s)]
*  the progressive establishment in america and [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2353.12s)]
*  They're the shows that have been look they've spent particularly the last eight years [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2356.72s)]
*  Very transparently morally judging the right half of america, you know judging trump supporters judging [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2363.8399999999997s)]
*  conservatives judging people who are kind of [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2371.3399999999997s)]
*  Judging people who were skeptics of the covet regime, you know all of this stuff and yet [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2374.16s)]
*  Is there ever a point where we start talking about this culture [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2381.76s)]
*  And how truly sick it is. I mean [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2386.56s)]
*  Isn't this bizarre dude that this guy? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2390.0s)]
*  Is just his name is brought up and it gets from the liberal women in the crowd [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2393.36s)]
*  like [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2399.36s)]
*  They're not even embarrassed to just loudly be cheering [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2400.32s)]
*  For him because like he's a hot [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2404.4s)]
*  Murderer or something like that. I I don't know rob how much you've been following this [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2407.44s)]
*  I really have not myself that much at all because it really um [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2411.92s)]
*  Sometimes there are topics that just make me genuinely uncomfortable [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2416.56s)]
*  And I just can't [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2420.7200000000003s)]
*  What you know, it's like people get into those like a pedophile hunting [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2422.56s)]
*  Shows like I just can't watch them because it's too creepy [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2426.08s)]
*  And like I feel the same way about people who actually like are writing this guy love letters and trying to [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2429.28s)]
*  Date him from prison or whatever [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2435.2s)]
*  but [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2437.44s)]
*  The dude straight up murdered somebody in cold blood. That's all we know about him [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2438.4s)]
*  Evidently from the other information that i've seen out there. He was not a policy holder of united [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2444.56s)]
*  So it's not even like what the story seemed like it was at first [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2450.0s)]
*  Like you remember when it first happened and they tried to make it out like oh [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2453.76s)]
*  Maybe they denied his claims so much that he went and killed the ceo of the company [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2456.2400000000002s)]
*  No, that's not the story at all [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2461.04s)]
*  And yet still like how sick is this that you're making this guy into like a sex object or something like that? I [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2463.2000000000003s)]
*  I just find this so bizarre [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2470.96s)]
*  Um, well as a person who's attracted to men I fully understand [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2474.2400000000002s)]
*  Why these women are so excited by the guy being taken away in a jumpsuit? Um [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2478.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean firstly there's it just it's it [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2483.52s)]
*  I I did the joke on run your mouth that for some reason they got this guy in designer streetwear [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2486.88s)]
*  And then there was that ugly guatemalan and they put him in a trash bag [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2491.12s)]
*  So I don't understand [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2494.32s)]
*  I don't understand what government's making them look cool and they're doing a parade for him [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2496.08s)]
*  It's like it's almost like that con air scene with uh, steve buchemi [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2500.16s)]
*  And like almost doing it up like how how much of a badass this guy is [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2504.2400000000002s)]
*  um [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2508.48s)]
*  There is all right. I want to make it clear. I'm not endorsing violence. Nobody should go out and kill anybody and [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2510.08s)]
*  We're here and we're kind of idealistic and that's what we do [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2517.84s)]
*  And so we talk to what should be the better avenues to clean these things up [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2520.88s)]
*  And obviously the problem in our health care is the government's involvement. It's the very existence of insurance [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2525.2799999999997s)]
*  It's licensing laws and uh, it's the conglomeration of these companies and that you can't just have open markets to go [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2531.2s)]
*  Purchase insurance blah blah blah. We can go on and on about the problem with uh, insurance and government's involvement in it [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2538.1600000000003s)]
*  um, I do think that you know [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2545.04s)]
*  Violence works very well. And for the most part government has monopolized violence and we're not really able to just pursue means for justice [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2548.7200000000003s)]
*  or for violence [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2557.6000000000004s)]
*  Um, the fact that a ceo was murdered and that there's so much discontent with health care [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  That people are even excited and think that it was justifiable that a ceo of a corporation that they see as being evil was murdered [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2565.52s)]
*  I mean you want to talk about what might enact better change is you know people being on notice of hey if our corporations are actually [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2573.92s)]
*  really [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2581.84s)]
*  Fleecing people and maybe it's just because of the backings of the guy [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2583.04s)]
*  I'm just saying if you want to game theory things that might create so [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2586.0s)]
*  All i'm trying to say is the fact that people are excited about this [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2590.24s)]
*  I think it's because they're real [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2593.44s)]
*  There is discontent and they'd like to see a change initiated and they're not really here [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2595.52s)]
*  Is that better than if government were to step in and you know? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2600.48s)]
*  Like i'm not i'm not advocating for the violence. I'm more justifying why I think people are [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2603.92s)]
*  Uh, not completely condemning this like I I just understand where people are coming from where they're like [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2608.96s)]
*  Um, and and that's tragic that people feel so imprisoned by bad systems and by the way government's operating that they're now going to be [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2614.48s)]
*  Excited for hits against ceos, but I mean it that's kind of where we're at [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2622.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I when I was on pierce morgan's show, um a few days before christmas [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2628.2400000000002s)]
*  And he brought up like a poll [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2633.76s)]
*  Of young people I think it was 25 and under in which like 40 percent of them had said that they had a favorable view [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  of this luigi, uh, whatever his name is guy and you know, I [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2644.4s)]
*  I basically said on the show that [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2649.6000000000004s)]
*  You know like same with you like I condemned the violence of it [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2653.2000000000003s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, this is like sick and disgusting and this is not a good solution to any of these problems [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2656.6400000000003s)]
*  And you know first off it's horrible. The guy's got a family and like that's terrible [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2661.84s)]
*  And then also it's just like well, what are we going to do? You're going to go murder everybody you have an issue with [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  That's not a way to run a good society [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2670.8s)]
*  Um, but I did say that like look, I mean for all of us who feel that way [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2674.24s)]
*  You got to look at a poll like this and be like, whoa, what's going on here? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2680.24s)]
*  and particularly [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2684.48s)]
*  With young people and I was like, well look, I mean I do think we have to be kind of honest [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2686.24s)]
*  And this is something, you know, i've talked about a lot on the show [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2693.44s)]
*  But it's like one of these themes that you can never talk about enough, but it is [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2696.16s)]
*  What's being done to young people in our society is so profoundly wrong [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2701.2799999999997s)]
*  And so many I think of these young kids are just in this situation that [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2709.68s)]
*  you know [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2714.16s)]
*  it is [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2715.36s)]
*  The fact that like my grandfather could have in a much more primitive economy in a much less advanced economy in a much poorer society [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2718.32s)]
*  That my grandfather could when he graduated high school [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2730.32s)]
*  Could and and this is true for everyone in his generation could go wait on a line to get a job at a factory [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2735.1200000000003s)]
*  and get a job that day and have a job that they could support a family off of [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  Where the woman didn't have to work and you could own a house and have two cars and send your kids to decent schools and [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2748.0s)]
*  Play poker with your buddies on the weekend and whatever, you know, like just live a normal american life [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2755.04s)]
*  And the fact that now today with so with where we're such a richer country [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2761.12s)]
*  technological advancements over the time my grandfather graduated from high school that are [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2766.46s)]
*  essentially indistinguishable from magic [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2771.58s)]
*  Compared to what they had back then [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2774.08s)]
*  And that now you've got an entire generation of young people who are [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2776.8s)]
*  Six figures in debt from a bullshit. Um, uh liberal college with a bullshit liberal arts degree [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2782.24s)]
*  um, they are [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2789.7599999999998s)]
*  Working for at a starbucks or a coffee house or whatever for you know, uh, maybe 20 bucks an hour [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2791.7599999999998s)]
*  If they're lucky, um, maybe they get to split up a tip jar at the end of their shift [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2800.3999999999996s)]
*  And the average price of a house is like 600 grand [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2805.6s)]
*  And there is no [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2809.6800000000003s)]
*  even conceivable path [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2811.84s)]
*  For particularly i'll just say in this for young men [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2814.32s)]
*  I mean it's true for young women too, but there's a particular dynamic with young men when you have no conceivable path to go from that [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2816.7200000000003s)]
*  toward [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2824.62s)]
*  Owning a home starting a family being able to provide a decent a reasonable life for a family [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  in that situation [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2833.12s)]
*  You're going to have problems and I think one of the problems is that yeah [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2835.2s)]
*  They start looking at a guy like this as someone who I don't know [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2840.24s)]
*  took things into his own hands and did something about it and [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2844.08s)]
*  there is something man where it's like [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2848.96s)]
*  You you want to be able to understand that mentality as best you can that doesn't mean you want to justify it or agree with it [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2852.4s)]
*  But you do want to understand that mentality because something like when you're getting cheers like this when you bring up that guy's name [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2860.32s)]
*  something sick is going on like [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2867.6800000000003s)]
*  and you kind of want to be like what exactly is the diagnosis here because there's something really disturbing happening and [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2870.08s)]
*  I you know, I I do think that's that's at least part of the reason [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2877.6s)]
*  Why young people are looking at this like good, you know someone went and did something [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2882.48s)]

*  Well, you know, it's it's kind of similar to the way like kids become school shooters when they're all messed up [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2891.2s)]
*  It's like as much as that is just pure destruction and evil and and it's not making your life any better [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2896.56s)]
*  A lot of times people prefer that identity to being the kid who's just picked on all the time [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2903.36s)]
*  I'd rather be the one who fucking instilled fear in everybody else [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2909.6s)]

*  That he got that reaction from his own audience and then he has to go like yeah [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2934.8s)]
*  I don't I don't know if we should be wooing this guy, but there really is a there's something [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=2938.24s)]

*  um, there's also [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3004.0s)]
*  You know, I I don't know [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3005.92s)]
*  I know when it came to uh [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3008.1600000000003s)]
*  The creation of obama care one of the big talking points was hey [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3010.0800000000004s)]
*  We need go we need we need coverage for pre-existing condition which is an insurance [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3013.84s)]
*  And so you essentially you sit down with the it's the mob bosses sit down [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3018.8s)]
*  You got obama sits down with the insurance companies goes I need you guys to cover for pre-existing conditions and they go fine [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3022.72s)]
*  Here's how we do it. You got to get rid of our competition and so you can't have catastrophic care plans [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3028.64s)]
*  I'm sure that they eliminated other forms of competition [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3034.3199999999997s)]
*  But that's one of the things that they did is we need more young healthy individuals to be paying [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3037.2s)]
*  Insurance premiums and what we in you're not going to be able to purchase insurance year-round because we can't screen for pre-existing conditions [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3042.4s)]
*  So now there's going to be a limited window of which you can acquire insurance and so [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3049.8399999999997s)]
*  Obama gets to get on tv and say hey, I look good [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3054.3199999999997s)]
*  I got you coverage for your pre-existing conditions and then the insurance companies they got what they needed to make sure that they're still profitable [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3057.04s)]
*  Um, and I I think by most metrics more profitable [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3063.44s)]
*  Um as uh, you increase the demand for their product and got rid of some of the competition. Okay now [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3066.48s)]
*  There's mechanisms by which uh insurance companies can boost their profits and one of them is handling claims [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3072.96s)]
*  Which is essentially when people are making their claims you try and do everything you can not to pay them out [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3080.08s)]
*  um [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3086.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm sure to some extent there were similar meetings between the insurance companies and government [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3087.2799999999997s)]
*  in terms of what they can get away with but like for example, if you [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3093.36s)]
*  Have a health care problem [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3098.4s)]
*  And your insurance company is supposed to cover it and for some period of time they delay it [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3100.3199999999997s)]
*  Or they deny it and then you're able to get your care later on [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3105.44s)]
*  And i'm not familiar with this [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3108.88s)]
*  I don't know if there's any mechanism to sue them for the amount of time you were in pain [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3110.4s)]
*  Or the hardship you had to go through in order to get coverage [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3114.96s)]
*  Um, so I know an example I I know with a family member that they had like a an older family member that they had a hip [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3117.84s)]
*  Replacement that was ultimately covered by insurance [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3123.5800000000004s)]
*  But my uncle said it took him 15 phone calls and a month for them to finally process it [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3126.56s)]
*  Is there a way to sue the insurance company that you're then able to you know, basically get paid for your full-time job? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3132.4s)]
*  Of having to get them to just pay for what you've been paying into the system for so [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3138.8s)]
*  I I do think a lot of it comes down to the government protections of these companies [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3144.96s)]
*  And that they're able to use these tools without you know, the same as vaccine manufacturers don't have to pay for uh for [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3150.0800000000004s)]
*  For liability and injuries and I don't know the specifics of what exists in insurance [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3157.04s)]
*  um, the point i'm getting at is that [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3161.04s)]
*  The like [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3164.16s)]
*  You understand how corrupt the system has to be that for most individuals or 40 of college kids if you ask them [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3165.52s)]
*  Hey, if you go murder the head of this company [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3171.28s)]
*  Do you think that should be a crime or consider vigilante justice? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3174.16s)]
*  And if you then went down the corporations of america, I bet you said ceo of starbucks [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3177.68s)]
*  41 of them aren't going to say oh you can kill the ceo of starbucks [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3181.58s)]
*  but now if you start asking them about weapons manufacturers or maybe [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3185.44s)]
*  In a couple years from now if there was more bad data about vaccines and you started telling them about the ceo [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3190.24s)]
*  You know the guy in charge of pfizer [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3196.32s)]
*  That they're it just kind of showcases the fact that government's not doing its job and is offering too much protections to these companies [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3198.72s)]
*  That the general public is actually okay with vigilante justice in order to even if they might say [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3205.68s)]
*  Hey, this is wrong and it's terrible that this guy lost his kids [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3212.24s)]
*  But this system is so corrupt where we actually need violence on our side to try and force the hand [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3215.2s)]
*  I mean, it's not that different than terrorism at that point [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3220.64s)]
*  But it's just kind of showcasing where people are at that. They see this as being the only way towards change [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3225.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I think it is terrorism if the goal was some type of political change [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3231.68s)]
*  Which i'm i'm not sure about but if that is the goal then I think it meets the definition of terrorism [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3236.4s)]
*  I don't even know if that's the kid's goal as much as that's I think people I think people are excited about for two reasons [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3241.04s)]
*  One the kid's attractive and that's just a horrible flaw in human logic that we like people that are more attractive and you can look [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3246.32s)]
*  At crime statistics. They end up with uh with lesser sentences blah blah blah because we all just uh, uh [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3252.6400000000003s)]
*  Just grant goodness to people who look attractive and just assume that they're better people. It's dumb. It's a it's a human stupid fallacy [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3259.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, and then there's just maybe we're right [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3267.2000000000003s)]
*  So maybe we're right to do it. Maybe they are just better than us rob [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3270.32s)]
*  Yeah, pride bit for president your point, but I get your point. I mean look there's no question [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3273.44s)]
*  It's it's interestingly one of the uh, privilege groups that never comes up [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3277.1200000000003s)]
*  I always thought through the years of like, um kind of the rise of really insane social justice warrior stuff [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3282.48s)]
*  um [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3289.84s)]
*  I always thought it was so funny every time you'd have like, um [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3291.44s)]
*  an attractive girl [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3296.48s)]
*  Talking about like male privilege or white privilege or whatever it is and you're like are you [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3298.64s)]
*  You're really going to ignore the elephant in the room here [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3305.04s)]
*  Which is that you have the number one privilege of all of these things which by the way to your point [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3307.52s)]
*  Is born out in study after study after study. There is just no question about it that [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3313.52s)]
*  Human beings give preferential treatment to good-looking people. It's particularly true for good-looking women [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3319.12s)]
*  Again i'm not knocking you for that. Hey you were born with it and enjoy it. It's [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3325.76s)]
*  Something that we all participate in I guess in some way [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3331.36s)]
*  but like if you're having a conversation about privilege you might want to think about that as being one of the major ones like [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3334.16s)]
*  the level of privilege between like [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3340.16s)]
*  a gorgeous chick [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3343.6s)]
*  and a really ugly dude is just like [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3345.52s)]
*  They're living in two different universes when it comes to like participating in society, um [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3349.8399999999997s)]
*  But yeah, I mean I think look [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3357.04s)]
*  I mean one of the things I guess that disturbs me to no end about this is that because of the biases in left-wing [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3358.48s)]
*  thought there's like there is almost like because you're [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3365.52s)]
*  the ceo [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3370.3199999999997s)]
*  Of a company that's like in this fucked up field. They'll always be kind of like [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3372.16s)]
*  Less sympathy [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3378.08s)]
*  For you you get totally like dehumanized [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3380.08s)]
*  Yet the government the political class [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3384.2400000000002s)]
*  Escapes without any of the blame and like personally to me [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3387.42s)]
*  I just have so much more contempt for the government's role in this than I do for some guy who's just kind of like [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3391.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, these are the rules of this fucked up game and i'm gonna play within them to make as much money as I can [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3397.04s)]
*  That that to me does not seem as fucked up as like people who pose as our elected representatives [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3404.2400000000002s)]
*  Who sell us out in order to to create? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3411.04s)]
*  This fucked up system [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3415.04s)]
*  Um, so there's always there's there's a that's a huge [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3416.7200000000003s)]
*  You know factor for me that I just think is very disturbing about this [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3420.08s)]
*  I also think you know to your point. Oh here we could play this clip because I never played this [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3423.6800000000003s)]
*  This was like from a couple weeks ago, but I did just think this was so funny [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3427.92s)]
*  Um, but let's do the whoopie goldberg on the view because when you thought when you were talking about like, um [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3431.52s)]
*  You know pre-existing conditions and how you're no longer dealing with insurance [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3437.44s)]
*  I mean you cannot begin to even have this conversation [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3441.92s)]
*  when [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3446.16s)]
*  the like [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3447.2s)]
*  The literacy level of the people who are having the conversation is so I mean you want to talk about not getting what? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3449.2s)]
*  Insurance is here is whoopie goldberg on the view and yes, she actually said these words [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3455.52s)]
*  They actually left her face and came out of her mouth on national television. Here's whoopie on insurance [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3460.56s)]
*  There are things we can [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3468.8s)]
*  Fool with and things we can't health care is one of those things [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3471.52s)]
*  That you shouldn't be able to fool with and insurance companies [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3476.16s)]
*  Who you pay I pay into my insurance you pay into your insurance [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3480.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't understand if I don't go to the hospital for a whole year. Where's my money? [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3485.52s)]
*  Why don't you give me the money back there? You don't have to worry about [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3489.92s)]
*  Because I feel like you know, I said this. Okay. Okay [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3493.52s)]
*  We got bill come on, I know we got bill coming [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3499.12s)]
*  All [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3503.6s)]
*  Right [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3504.7200000000003s)]
*  There is whoopie I think the only correct thing that she said in there was I do not understand [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3505.52s)]
*  And she nailed that [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3513.2s)]
*  She nailed that part. I think I told you this rob when we first when I first saw this video, but chris rock [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3515.12s)]
*  I remember chris rock had a bit about this [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3521.28s)]
*  Um, it was either in bring the pain or bigger and blacker [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3523.68s)]
*  It was in one of his great comedy specials and back in the day [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3526.88s)]
*  I mean chris those two specials were so good. It has been a long time since i've seen them [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3529.84s)]
*  But there I I thought that at the time these were like two of the best comedy specials that had ever been made [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3533.92s)]
*  But he had one joke that was like that where it was like they shouldn't call it insurance [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3538.7200000000003s)]
*  They should call it in case shit you pay in case shit happens now [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3543.0400000000004s)]
*  Tell me this if shit don't happen shouldn't I get my money back? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3547.28s)]
*  And I remember at the time and I adored I just loved him as a comedian [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3551.2000000000003s)]
*  And um, and I wasn't a libertarian or anything like that yet [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3555.6800000000003s)]
*  I wasn't interested in politics, but I remember just hearing that joke and going [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3558.8s)]
*  And that doesn't really work [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3562.56s)]
*  Because that's stupid [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3565.4399999999996s)]
*  Because that's the whole point [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3567.12s)]
*  The whole point is that you're mitigating risk and you're paying [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3569.2s)]
*  a smaller amount than the catastrophe would be [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3573.12s)]
*  To insure yourself against a catastrophe happening [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3577.4399999999996s)]
*  And then if the catastrophe if the catastrophe happens the idea is you won't be on the hook for all of it because you paid [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3579.7599999999998s)]
*  This small amount in but for whoopi goldberg like a grown adult who's on a talk show where they talk about these issues [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3585.2799999999997s)]
*  To say that is it you're like, oh [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3592.16s)]
*  So we can't even begin to have a conversation about this because in your warped [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3595.2000000000003s)]
*  Liberal worldview they're already robbing from you by not giving you your money back at the end of a year [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3601.5s)]
*  If you didn't go to the hospital like it's almost but by the way, I mean this reminds me of [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3608.48s)]
*  When left-wingers will talk about profit sharing for all the workers [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3614.0s)]
*  You know rob will say why shouldn't the workers all share in the profits and you'll be like, okay [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3619.52s)]
*  Should they share in the losses? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3624.64s)]
*  Oh, no, you don't want them to share. Okay. Well, it's only it's it's either both both or neither [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3627.44s)]
*  You can't just share in the good stuff, but not share in any of the bad stuff [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3632.8s)]
*  That's not how life works [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3636.56s)]
*  And so like if you're going like if you're saying like well [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3638.32s)]
*  Hey, if I pay these insurance premiums and I don't use health care for the whole year, shouldn't I get all the money back? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3641.28s)]
*  it's like [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3646.56s)]
*  Sure, if when you do need to use it the insurance company can also say oh, we're not paying for any of it [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3647.68s)]
*  Then that's an even trade. I don't know what what the point is here. No, like are you this brain dead? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3654.72s)]
*  No, that's not the way it works [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3660.16s)]
*  The whole point is you got a lot of people pooling in a little bit of money [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3662.16s)]
*  And if one person has a gigantic expense the little people the little pools cover that gigantic expense [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3666.24s)]
*  If you have to give back all the money that everyone's pooling in what's going to cover that gigantic expense? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3672.24s)]
*  That like it this makes absolutely no sense at all [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3677.44s)]
*  But this is actually the mentality and i'm not claiming me and you are two genius experts or anything like that [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3681.04s)]
*  But what do you even say when the people discussing this have zero understanding of what the topic they're even discussing is [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3688.08s)]
*  So this is what this is whoopi goldberg's idea of how health insurance should work that [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3697.2799999999997s)]
*  Multi millionaires should get their money back for their premiums if they didn't go to the doctor that year [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3702.56s)]
*  I mean, I I don't know what to say about that rob you can you can take a stab at it [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3709.44s)]
*  Yeah, whoopi goldberg's an idiot [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3714.56s)]
*  Yeah, I guess there you go. I guess that pretty much sums it up. All right guys, uh, that's that's our show for today [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJrSIBcByhM&t=3717.2s)]
