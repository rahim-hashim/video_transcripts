# Dave Smith | Thoughts on the JRE Debate | Part Of The Problem 1251
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k)
*  What's up, what's up everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=9.32s)]
*  Kind of a special episode, a late night episode. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Of course, I'm Dave Smith and he is Robbie the fire Bernstein. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=16.22s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=19.16s)]
*  I'm doing well. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=20.16s)]
*  I'm so close to being done with having to take Adderall and put together these poor [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=21.16s)]
*  store dates and I'm very excited to be done with it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm in Pensacola, Florida is the start of the tour and you can find that at porch store.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=28.64s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=33.2s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=34.2s)]
*  Make sure you guys, if you're in the area where porch tour comes, go out and see one [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=35.2s)]
*  of the shows. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=37.68s)]
*  This has become legendary at this point. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=38.68s)]
*  People tell me I hear led all the time I'm on the road. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=40.4s)]
*  Oh, I went to the porch tour. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  He brought me in the middle of the woods and did a ceremony of some sorts. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And then it's not the best show of my life. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=48.16s)]
*  Then I passed out and woke up, you know, blood coming out of my ass. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=50.28s)]
*  I don't know how many more, I don't know how many more purchase I've left in me. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=54.64s)]
*  I don't I don't know that I got another year of taking Adderall and coordinating dates. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=57.72s)]
*  So this might be the last one. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=61.04s)]
*  Anyway, so I just I just got home today, spent the day with the family. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=65.08s)]
*  It was very nice. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=69.44s)]
*  I've been on a crazy stretch of just traveling nonstop. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=70.44s)]
*  And of course, it the last thing that I did was that well, I was out, you know, we were [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=75.52s)]
*  in Boston. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=81.16s)]
*  Then I went down to Austin, did a solo episode with Rogan. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=82.16s)]
*  Then I went and did the Nashville Comedy Festival, hung out with Kid Rock. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Did you get a word in guy? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=89.68s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=90.68s)]
*  He talks about tariffs. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=91.68s)]
*  Dude, he couldn't have been cooler. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=92.68s)]
*  Awesome guy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=95.08s)]
*  And no, we didn't talk tariffs. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=96.08s)]
*  I was just trying to angle for, you know, you try you don't you talk to Kid Rock to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=98.56s)]
*  get a meeting with Donald Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=102.28s)]
*  What makes you even think you should have an opinion? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=103.84s)]
*  Well, OK, so then let's get to it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=107.76s)]
*  And the thing that I did well just came out today and we did it yesterday. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=111.56s)]
*  So I figured we'd do an episode kind of giving my thoughts on this debate. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm exhausted. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=121.44s)]
*  I've been doing a lot of traveling and I've been getting not so much sleep. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=122.44s)]
*  So this might be a little bit of a shorter one. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=127.32s)]
*  But I did think maybe we would just, you know, talk about it a little bit. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=129.28s)]
*  I could give my thoughts, my recap of it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=132.84s)]
*  And you I know you watched it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=135.72s)]
*  So you could give me your thoughts on it as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=137.0s)]
*  It was my opinion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I watched it and I have thoughts, but where do I get a credential? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=141.44s)]
*  Well, were you there? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=144.88s)]
*  But were you there, though? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Were you live? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=147.52s)]
*  I've never set foot in the Rogan studio. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=148.52s)]
*  So I guess I haven't. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=150.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=151.68s)]
*  Unless your feet touch the ground, you don't really absorb the information. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=152.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=155.04s)]
*  You shouldn't really talk about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=156.04s)]
*  I'm not arguing that you shouldn't talk about it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=157.04s)]
*  That's not my point. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=158.72s)]
*  My point isn't that you shouldn't talk about it, but you shouldn't talk about it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=159.72s)]
*  And probably there should be experts who talk about it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=162.48s)]
*  And that's not OK. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=165.72s)]
*  Anyway, you know, I kind of I my assumption is I know it's. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=167.56s)]
*  Sometimes it almost seems a little, you know, douchey to do these recap episodes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=176.36s)]
*  It's just I think this is probably going to end up being the biggest thing that I've ever [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=177.36s)]
*  done. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  I just have the feeling that this debate, I think me and Douglas debating would have [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  been a big numbers show anywhere. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  But then you put that on Rogan and it's like, holy shit, this is going to be a big, you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=187.8s)]
*  know, a big episode. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=191.56s)]
*  And people love debates like that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  So it was, you know, going into it, it was like, OK, this is going to be a big thing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=195.28000000000003s)]
*  This is I was very much looking forward to it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=199.84s)]
*  I'm a bit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=204.68s)]
*  I was fairly confident about how it would go. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm happy with how it went. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=209.4s)]
*  It's it's I think it's great. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=210.88s)]
*  I'm a bit shocked at how crazy it was. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=213.56s)]
*  And in the way I'll say this, right, is an interesting. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=216.0s)]
*  Being Douglas both whatever side you're on, one of the really interesting dynamics, I [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=221.88s)]
*  thought of the debate that stuck out to me was that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=226.28s)]
*  And I think even if you're like a Douglas Murray fan and you think, oh, he smoked me [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=229.8s)]
*  or whatever, which most people seem to not think is the case. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=233.84s)]
*  But some of his say, you know, he's got a lot of big fan base and I have a big fan [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=237.92s)]
*  base. And so in those debates, there's always some people who are just firm on one side. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=242.32s)]
*  The interesting thing that we could all acknowledge is that me and him debating would [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=247.32s)]
*  have been way more vicious on both ends on any other platform. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=251.8s)]
*  It was only because it was on Rogan that we're both. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=256.56s)]
*  So the whole time, both of us like want to be going more vicious than we are. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=259.36s)]
*  But we're both kind of holding back, which just made for like a strange and kind of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=263.92s)]
*  funny dynamic to the debate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=268.36s)]
*  You know, I know that what Rogan wanted was to have like a civil exchange of ideas [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=271.24s)]
*  and not have it turn into like a vicious food fight. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=276.76s)]
*  And so I was like not going to disrespect that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=280.12s)]
*  And I understand why on that platform it it should be a little bit different than it [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=282.6s)]
*  is on Piers Morgan or something like this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=286.92s)]
*  This is for long form conversations. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=288.8s)]
*  So I go into it with that attitude. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=291.6s)]
*  And I also think that's kind of why I didn't. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=294.08s)]
*  You know, there were areas I probably could have gone a little bit harder on him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=297.08s)]
*  But I also look, I'll say this and then I'll shut up and let you talk for a little [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=300.0s)]
*  bit and you could tell me what you think. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=307.04s)]
*  But I really I left there with the feeling I would say even a half hour in to the show. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=308.6s)]
*  I just. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the reaction that we're getting, you know, I've had a lot of debates where [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=318.24s)]
*  the reaction is overwhelmingly that I won the debate in this particular case. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=322.2s)]
*  It's just that he lost it like it wasn't even that I beat him in the debate. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=327.64s)]
*  He started out with a 40 minute struggle session for Joe Rogan that just contained [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=332.56s)]
*  probably the longest stretched logical fallacy I've ever seen anyone open a debate [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=342.28s)]
*  with just a naked appeal to authority, completely unclear with what he was saying. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  He literally he came in. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=353.76s)]
*  So in this struggle session with Joe Rogan, I could make this up. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=355.32s)]
*  This is barely before I presented any thought or argument or opinion. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=358.28s)]
*  I think I think it was before that he comes in with this long stroke that is an [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=363.44s)]
*  appeal to authority, an appeal to expertise. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  You're having these non experts talk about issues that experts should talk about. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=370.92s)]
*  And I'm not saying they should be censored and I'm not saying they shouldn't talk about it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=374.92s)]
*  But they're talking about it and they're acting like they're experts. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=378.0s)]
*  How are they acting like they're experts? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=380.56s)]
*  Because they're talking about it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=381.8s)]
*  And when they're talking about it, it was just the most ridiculous argument, the most [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=383.12s)]
*  pompous, elitist, but essentially telling the host of the show and the entire audience, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  your opinion doesn't matter. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=394.64s)]
*  Like it was just a strategy to me that was like, do you want to make everyone think [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=396.08s)]
*  you're a pompous asshole? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  It was wild in there sandwiched in this appeal to expertise. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  He trashes Darrell Cooper and Ian Carroll, whose names he doesn't even know and admits [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=407.68s)]
*  that he's never consumed any of their material before. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=413.64s)]
*  Yet he's trashing them and then claiming that you can only talk about these issues if [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=417.24s)]
*  you have expertise. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  Then when he's asked, does he have expertise? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=422.2s)]
*  He goes, well, in some things, do you talk about things you don't have expertise in? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=424.08s)]
*  Yeah, all the time I talk about things I don't have expertise in. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=427.0s)]
*  OK, well, why can you do that? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=429.04s)]
*  You're not even understanding my point. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=431.16s)]
*  You know, it was just like the most wild thing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=433.24s)]
*  And it just became clear as the show went on that Douglas Murray came to do anything [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=435.96000000000004s)]
*  but debate me. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  Like that was the theme of the entire show. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=445.68s)]
*  He was there to do every single thing except have an exchange of ideas with me. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  Everything it was from it was either I'm going to go on, you know, the long appeal to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  authority or I'm going to play ridiculous semantics games with you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  Like when I say we are at war, you say we are we at war and you're not at war. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=464.56s)]
*  Your military is having an action and you're not. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=469.48s)]
*  And just contradicting himself constantly. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  The things he like instead of ever taking on my argument, he would think it was a big [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=476.6s)]
*  blow to be like, you haven't been there. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=482.16s)]
*  You haven't been there. You don't have expertise. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's so bizarre because it's like. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  This would be like, I'm not saying I would agree with it, but at least it would make [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=491.04s)]
*  sense if Douglas Murray refused to debate me and then made a video about why he [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=495.04s)]
*  wouldn't debate me. And in the video, he said because he doesn't have expertise and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=499.72s)]
*  because he hasn't been there and because. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=504.12s)]
*  OK, but once you agreed to the debate, you can't just say I have expertise and you [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=506.04s)]
*  don't have experts. You can't spend 40 minutes on that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=512.04s)]
*  It's like demonstrate it, motherfucker. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=514.4s)]
*  If you've been there and that gives you some greater insight, then demonstrate that [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  and win the argument and counter what I'm saying. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=521.64s)]
*  He would never. I mean, the entire thing, it was straw man. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=524.5999999999999s)]
*  He would argue against what other people are saying. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, if I said, oh, the NED in the USAID poured one hundred million dollars into [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=532.48s)]
*  the Maidan protests in 2014, he'd go, you know, sometimes libertarians speak as if [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=537.7199999999999s)]
*  everything that happens in the world is done by America. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=543.76s)]
*  And really, there are no other actors and nobody else has agency. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=546.68s)]
*  And I'm like, what? No, all the people there have agency. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=550.16s)]
*  Also, the US poured one hundred million dollars into a street putsch that overthrew [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  a democratically elected government like what? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=556.2399999999999s)]
*  No matter who I do to his big like blows that he tried to land were I'm not an expert, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=557.9599999999999s)]
*  but I present myself as an expert. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=563.92s)]
*  And then I said, I don't claim to be an expert. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=566.36s)]
*  And he said, see, that's the problem. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=568.12s)]
*  I haven't been there. I haven't been to Israel. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=570.64s)]
*  So therefore, I don't know. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=573.48s)]
*  Can't comment on it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=576.36s)]
*  And then at the end, what I I literally cited that the supreme commander of the of the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=578.52s)]
*  NATO forces and the four star general, Wesley Clark said that the plans to overthrow seven [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=585.52s)]
*  different governments came from Paul Wolfowitz. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=591.32s)]
*  And he said, I shouldn't say Paul Wolfowitz because that'll make people hate Jews or [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=593.72s)]
*  something like that. I can't mention the deputy defense secretary anyway. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=599.4s)]
*  I don't know. You could tell me what you thought of it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  But it was a it was I don't really think I particularly won the debate. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=607.76s)]
*  I think he just showed up trying to do anything he could not to debate. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=612.72s)]
*  It was transparent. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=617.12s)]
*  People could see through it. It was smug and condescending. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=618.48s)]
*  And that's why the reaction is what it is. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=621.4s)]
*  That's kind of my thoughts. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=623.8000000000001s)]
*  First, it did an excellent job. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  It was a it was a fun watch. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=628.36s)]
*  I knew that this was happening for a while and I was very excited for it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=630.04s)]
*  And that was a good recap there to hop into the Paul Wolfowitz thing, just because it's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  the last thing you said. And then maybe we could address some of the others because [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=637.96s)]
*  they were all just such fascinating points. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  But let's start with the Paul Wolfowitz one. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=644.6800000000001s)]
*  You mentioned the name and it was so not the point of what you were trying to address. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=647.24s)]
*  I think you guys were having a conversation about the regime changes in the area and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=654.04s)]
*  in the agency and you were trying to say, no, America's clearly had an involvement. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=658.4399999999999s)]
*  And he said that as an aside, he scoffed, oh, and you're like, well, why is that part [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=662.16s)]
*  funny? And then he circled it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=665.36s)]
*  He circled it back into an argument with himself about the detail that he picked up, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=667.4s)]
*  which was the guy's name, and then saying, well, what you're doing is bad for the Jews [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=672.24s)]
*  because it creates this this narrative that the Jews run the world, blah, blah, blah. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=676.96s)]
*  But it's like that was a minute side point from the bigger thing that you guys have been [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=681.16s)]
*  arguing with. He managed to circle himself into his own argument, which I thought we [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=686.08s)]
*  said. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=690.76s)]
*  It's all just like when you say and I know, look, there are a few people out there I did [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=692.08s)]
*  see who are like the hard, you know, look, I mean, with all of these things, the hardcore [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=696.64s)]
*  Israel supporters, some of them are just locked in and think somehow that was a really [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=700.68s)]
*  great point when he told me I haven't been to Israel or something, you know, like, but [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=705.28s)]
*  which is ridiculous. It's it's objectively a non-argument. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=709.64s)]
*  I thought you crushed him on that one and it actually got kind of dropped. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=713.64s)]
*  But I think if you can tell me if maybe I miss if I misheard this because it kind of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=718.3599999999999s)]
*  moved quickly, he had said that you need to be there. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=722.52s)]
*  You had a great point about the Nazi Germany thing. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=724.8s)]
*  But then you had a secondary point, which is weren't you there at the beginning of the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=727.3199999999999s)]
*  Ukraine war and said we could win it, which is well, then I thought that was such a [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=730.36s)]
*  bombshell of you were on the ground. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=734.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I thought the ground reporting and you got the story wrong. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=736.84s)]
*  So what what is being there do if that just gives you actually a bad take, dude? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=740.44s)]
*  All of them. Listen, all of it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=745.36s)]
*  It's objectively they're non-arguments. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=747.44s)]
*  They're just non-arguments. You get in a debate in the spirit of a debate. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=749.84s)]
*  You get zero points for that. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=753.48s)]
*  You haven't been there. OK, fine. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=755.2s)]
*  So what's the point? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=756.6800000000001s)]
*  Grapple with my argument. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=758.32s)]
*  I'm sitting there the whole time like, let's debate this. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=760.12s)]
*  He's like, let's debate Darrell Cooper and Ian Carroll, two people I know nothing about, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=762.96s)]
*  admittedly don't even know their names, admittedly have never consumed their content. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=767.12s)]
*  That's where he starts with. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=771.2s)]
*  I know, by the way, you have to be an expertise in the subject matter that you talk about, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=772.48s)]
*  you know, while demonstrating none of it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=776.16s)]
*  But the idea, look, number one, the appeal to authority obviously is a logical fallacy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=777.96s)]
*  On top of that, Joe has had many experts on many different subjects. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=784.76s)]
*  Douglas's issue, his issue isn't the proportionality, like he said, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=790.0s)]
*  or that Joe Rogan doesn't have enough experts on. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=794.48s)]
*  I mean, listen, like he he he didn't complain. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=797.2s)]
*  I brought up he was like, who have you had on who's on this side? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=800.36s)]
*  And I brought up Coleman Hughes and like some other common use is not an expert on [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with what he [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=806.72s)]
*  said on the show. He's not he's going, oh, you've had more. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=810.08s)]
*  You've had way more people who are critical of the war in Ukraine and critical of the war [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=813.52s)]
*  in Palestine than those who support it on. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=817.68s)]
*  What does that mean? Joe Rogan is an obligation to be a 50-50. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=819.8399999999999s)]
*  What type of equity bullshit is this? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=823.56s)]
*  Do you think Douglas Murray is upset that Joe Rogan had more pro-Trump people than pro-Kamala [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=826.0s)]
*  people on? Because he did. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=830.52s)]
*  Is he upset about that? No, because he agrees with that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=832.88s)]
*  He agrees. So if he agrees with it, he wouldn't have a problem. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=835.92s)]
*  He's just he just wants more people spouting his shit on there. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=838.4s)]
*  But it's just such a weird thing to start the show complaining about. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  But then also, look, there are. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=844.88s)]
*  Look, the fact is there are an unlimited number of of experts, not an unlimited number, but [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=848.6s)]
*  a large, large number of experts on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=855.36s)]
*  Many of them are on the pro-Israel side. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=860.0s)]
*  Many of them are critical of Israel. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=862.16s)]
*  Like, it's not the case that you can. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=863.8s)]
*  And many people who have been to Israel, you know, agree with me. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=865.76s)]
*  Many people have been there, agree with with Douglas. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=870.9200000000001s)]
*  It's just a non point. It's nothing. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=874.9200000000001s)]
*  You get zero points for that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  And then, of course, every time I would make I mean, he was just evasive about everything. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=878.6s)]
*  So if I go like if I were to say, you know, like whatever the one point I said to him, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=883.8000000000001s)]
*  he was like, you know, the war wasn't over Ukraine entry into NATO. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=890.9200000000001s)]
*  And and I was like, OK, well, you got to admit they said forever that that was their [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=895.4000000000001s)]
*  brightest red line. And then there's all these people at the top level of our intelligence [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=899.32s)]
*  who said, you know, when they say this is the red line, I think they really mean it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=902.96s)]
*  I think we better not flirt with crossing this red line. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=906.88s)]
*  And then we kept flirting with crossing the red line. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=909.32s)]
*  And he'd be like, oh, so now you trust the head of the CIA? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=911.88s)]
*  As if like there's some contradiction, like, yeah, now I love the organization that is [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  the CIA. I'm just saying even the CIA head himself admitted they all say this is the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  brightest of red lines and I think they mean it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=924.6400000000001s)]
*  And I think this might lead to war that you're not taking on the argument at all. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=927.2s)]
*  And then he'd go, well, it wasn't about NATO expansion and say something else about how [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=931.88s)]
*  Putin wants to constitute the Soviet Union. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=935.48s)]
*  And I'd say, OK, well, the head of NATO literally said that Vladimir Putin sent him a [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=938.04s)]
*  draft treaty saying just put into writing that you won't bring Ukraine into NATO and [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=943.28s)]
*  then I won't invade right before he invaded. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=949.28s)]
*  And he'll go, the war was never about that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=952.76s)]
*  And then there's always this feeling that it's about the Americans and it's always [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=955.16s)]
*  about what we're doing. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=958.52s)]
*  And it's not it's like you didn't counter the art. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=959.72s)]
*  You know, like, he's just not he was there to do anything he could do except grapple [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=961.72s)]
*  with any of the arguments because, you know, on some level, he knows the shit is [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=967.04s)]
*  indefensible. I mean, I don't know what to say. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=970.36s)]
*  And so I think. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=972.92s)]
*  It in a weird way, I ended up I think I ended up just collecting kind of an easy win [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=976.48s)]
*  on that. I mean, I'm glad people are telling me I did a good job. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=980.68s)]
*  I'm glad people feel that way. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=983.76s)]
*  But it just seemed almost like, oh, he's just kind of hanging himself. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=985.24s)]
*  I mean, think about like he came in and picked a fight with the moderator and then [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  essentially the entire audience. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=995.0s)]
*  It was like Jesus Christ. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=997.04s)]
*  And I just think that whatever, at least from what I've seen of the reaction, and I [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=998.4s)]
*  do tend to like, you know, I tried my best to not like live in the YouTube comments. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1002.96s)]
*  But on a show like this, it's kind of impossible for me to not, you know, when you [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1008.76s)]
*  do this on, it's not like if I do a show in front of my audience where I kind of, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1011.92s)]
*  you know, I know my audience knows me very well and I know them very well. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1016.88s)]
*  And at this point, the Joe Rogan audience knows me, but it's not the same. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1020.52s)]
*  And it's such a huge show that you're like, oh, I like I'm kind of interested how [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1024.32s)]
*  people responded to this. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1029.6s)]
*  And it was, I mean, the second I looked through the comments, it was like exactly [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1031.8s)]
*  what I said after the show, exactly what everyone there, because he like left [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1036.32s)]
*  right after. And I asked a bunch of the people who are there and like, watch it [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1039.68s)]
*  like, hey, what'd you guys think? Brutally honest. Like, what'd you think? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1042.0s)]
*  And they were all like, oh, he just killed himself like right away. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1044.4s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. And then that's what every single comment was. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  Every comment was just like torching him for that shit. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1050.3600000000001s)]
*  He couldn't even figure out what he was saying. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1053.48s)]
*  It felt like for the first like 40 and he took 40 minutes. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1055.68s)]
*  He took like 40 minutes of the thing and just dragged it into this struggle session. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1059.44s)]
*  It was so wild to sit there watching. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1063.28s)]
*  I'd love to take on some of the logic of the arguments he was putting forward. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  So the first one is we're not experts. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1069.84s)]
*  And so if we are an experts, we should be very easy to dismantle. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1072.76s)]
*  And if anything, we're round one. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1077.6399999999999s)]
*  And if you can't get through our questioning or your questioning, then there's no [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1079.4s)]
*  reason to have to escalate it to having a conversation with an expert because, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1084.28s)]
*  wow, this is the degree by which the expert class is lying about a topic that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1088.6s)]
*  someone as dumb as me take, take COVID, take green energy, take a lot of these [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1094.28s)]
*  topics that the expert class told us we weren't allowed to question. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1098.96s)]
*  Take the track record of this show. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1102.96s)]
*  It's if anything, it's showcasing the degree by which the expert class is lying [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1105.04s)]
*  and abusing, abusing that title that they fall apart under questioning and they [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1110.16s)]
*  need to appeal to authority and go, Hey, we can't have other people questioning [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1114.84s)]
*  this stuff or not. No one else is supposed to have an opinion. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1119.44s)]
*  We need you to trust the experts. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1122.28s)]
*  That's the only way that society functions. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1123.88s)]
*  Well, then if you guys, the experts and we're not, you should be very comfortable [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  to hop into the ideas, have the arguments and dismantle them. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1129.5600000000002s)]
*  And if you're unable to do that, maybe you shouldn't have the expert title or [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  maybe you're abusing it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1137.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. But also like, you know, it's right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1139.0800000000002s)]
*  And he made, he would make some arguments like that were things that, yeah, neither [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1141.8400000000001s)]
*  me nor Joe would have disagreed with, like what he was saying, the thing where he [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  was like, OK, I understand the experts have discredited themselves, but that [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1150.6s)]
*  doesn't mean we need to turn over every single stone or just have everything. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1154.12s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, sure. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1157.32s)]
*  OK, that's why you have to be judicious about it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1158.76s)]
*  But like, now let's be judicious. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1161.4399999999998s)]
*  We're here to talk about the issue. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1163.12s)]
*  Let's see if you have an actual argument. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1165.7199999999998s)]
*  Like it was enough. Like it almost felt like that whole thing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1167.6s)]
*  Like what I was saying before, when I was like, it would kind of make sense if [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1170.6399999999999s)]
*  if he had refused the debate and then was saying why he refused the debate and it was [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1174.72s)]
*  like, oh, this guy's beneath me. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1181.68s)]
*  He's not an expert, which, by the way, I thought I saw Sager and Jenny, who I love, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1183.4s)]
*  he posted today and he's like he has a bachelor's in like English or something, which [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1189.0s)]
*  I didn't even know. He's like totally just not an expert on anything. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1193.8799999999999s)]
*  This is the weirdest argument to be making. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1197.68s)]
*  But you know, I've made more tea than you, Dave. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So so, you know, well, he's a bit like he's making this this argument. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1204.56s)]
*  And there is something about it that and I'm not saying like, again, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1209.6s)]
*  it's like he's coming into a fight. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1214.92s)]
*  It's like we've agreed to fight. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1216.8s)]
*  And then before, like it's just like when the bell rings, he's like, well, let's just do [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1218.92s)]
*  like I just want to tell you for 40 minutes, like I'm such a better fighter than you. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1223.48s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy that I'm even fighting you. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1227.44s)]
*  This is just kind of ridiculous. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1229.44s)]
*  Like, why would I fight someone like you? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1231.04s)]
*  And I'm like standing here with my gloves up like, yeah, OK, but like, are we come on? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1233.2s)]
*  I think we're going to fight now and you can show me if you're better than me at this. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1237.76s)]
*  And then once it comes to that, it's like he has nothing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1242.0800000000002s)]
*  It's always so shocking, like they just have nothing. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1244.2s)]
*  The same way I felt after the Dennis Pregway, he didn't have one like real argument. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1246.88s)]
*  There wasn't anything that I said that it was like, oh, shit, he took that on and really [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1250.8400000000001s)]
*  knew better than me. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  They'd be like, OK, you know, the World Bank said that the the the embargo in 96, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1255.92s)]
*  which wasn't as severe as the full blockade that's been around it since 2007. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1261.96s)]
*  They said just for the one year that it they said it caused a 40 percent [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1267.76s)]
*  retraction in the economy of Gaza. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1272.0s)]
*  You know, the Great Depression was a 30 percent contraction. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1274.3999999999999s)]
*  So we gave them a Great Depression one year. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1277.32s)]
*  Now you've had this blockade on them since 2007. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1279.12s)]
*  What do you think that's done to the economy? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1282.2s)]
*  And his response is, oh, so you trust the World Bank now. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1283.84s)]
*  Very convenient. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1287.2s)]
*  Like, is that really taking on the argument? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1289.36s)]
*  OK, maybe their estimate isn't perfect or whatever. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1291.32s)]
*  Who's like, do you know? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1294.0800000000002s)]
*  Obviously, you've also never seen the border crossing. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1295.44s)]
*  So why would a firm analytics like that even be able to complement your analysis? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1298.4s)]
*  Right. Exactly. I mean, it's just it's just totally ridiculous. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1303.68s)]
*  Like just complete non-arguments. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1308.04s)]
*  You'd only embrace these tactics if you had nothing. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1309.72s)]
*  But I do think there's also and I do I think part of the reason why like that part, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1313.56s)]
*  that that clip actually soars. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1318.2s)]
*  You want to see you could if you want to bring that up, maybe we could play that clip [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1321.0800000000002s)]
*  because I think this one was I saw was getting shared a lot. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1325.32s)]
*  And I think it was one of the moments it's you know, I kind of felt like, you know, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1328.48s)]
*  in a weird way, it was a little bit similar to the Cuomo debate dynamic where [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1331.96s)]
*  like when I debated Chris Cuomo, I had like this huge it's by the way. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1336.6000000000001s)]
*  So if you go to my Twitter, it's a chief nerd posted it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's I retweeted it somewhere. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1344.8400000000001s)]
*  But if you want to grab that. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1346.32s)]
*  But, you know, I had this huge advantage when I debated Chris Cuomo, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1348.96s)]
*  because it's like the entire audience that we're talking to already decided [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1353.6399999999999s)]
*  they agree with me, not you on this. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1358.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like it's we're talking about the Iraq war now. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1360.76s)]
*  It's everybody agrees this thing was a mistake. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1364.0s)]
*  There's no like, you know, it's just it's as unanimous as an issue can get. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1366.24s)]
*  And even though somewhat ironically, even though like Donald Trump [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1369.9199999999998s)]
*  was the president through 2020 and was the you know, the buck stops with him. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1374.52s)]
*  He was the guy who made a lot of the terrible calls. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1379.08s)]
*  Yet in our very interesting political climate, only five years later, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1382.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's entire base is with Bobby Kennedy on the health stuff, not with, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1388.28s)]
*  you know what I mean, any of that shit. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1393.36s)]
*  Like everybody's rejected the covid stuff as being bullshit. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1394.72s)]
*  And so in the wake of that, the biggest like [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1399.04s)]
*  the biggest thing that we've ever like collectively lived through. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1403.92s)]
*  And there's this huge unanimous consent or damn near close [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1407.76s)]
*  that the unanimous agreement that, OK, yeah, all the experts got this wrong. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1412.2s)]
*  All of this was bullshit. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1417.8799999999999s)]
*  And all the mantra of trust the science and only listen to the experts [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1419.08s)]
*  was all just bullshit so that they could propagandize us with lies. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1423.24s)]
*  For him to even be attempting to make that argument, I just have this in time. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1427.8s)]
*  I have this huge advantage just because like the entire [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1432.72s)]
*  Rogan base is just like, oh, yeah, but that's everything we just reject. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1437.56s)]
*  You're making the exact argument that we all just saw was complete bullshit. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1441.52s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1445.88s)]
*  I think it was just again, it was kind of handed to me. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1447.28s)]
*  OK, yeah, let's let's play the clip and then we could we could discuss a little, I guess. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1451.56s)]
*  I do also think that one of the bigger [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1456.68s)]
*  kind of the bigger picture dynamics to all of this is that we have [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1459.92s)]
*  at least since 9 11 been in a state of perpetual war. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1466.0800000000002s)]
*  And all of these wars have been disasters. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1470.0s)]
*  They have been so many lies involved in selling all of them. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1474.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the whole Iraq war, the whole war in Afghanistan, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1477.92s)]
*  just lying the whole way through. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1481.96s)]
*  I mean, I remember literally having conversations with Green Berets [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1483.8400000000001s)]
*  in the middle of the war in Afghanistan. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1487.0400000000002s)]
*  And they're like, George W. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1489.04s)]
*  Bush is telling you that the army we're building up there is really successful. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1490.68s)]
*  This thing's going to fall in a week without us. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1494.0s)]
*  And then all through the Obama administration, it's just like lie after lie [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1496.6s)]
*  after lie with disastrous wars. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1499.8799999999999s)]
*  And so this does create a fertile ground for people to say, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1501.6399999999999s)]
*  I wonder if they were lying about all these wars. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1505.6399999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm not really trying to argue about it. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1507.68s)]
*  Hold on, you know, I'll pause it for one second. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  I'll go. I'll be I'm sorry. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  I just got to run and open a door. I'll be right back anyway. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1513.96s)]
*  OK, so sorry. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1516.76s)]
*  Where were we here? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1520.1599999999999s)]
*  OK, so I was talking about how we they they lied to us into all these wars. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1521.24s)]
*  It's created fertile ground for for people to believe their line about other things. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1525.12s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1531.36s)]

*  You got to get a Ridge Wallet. I love it myself. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1538.84s)]
*  I use it all the time. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1541.4399999999998s)]
*  You don't need the old school, big, clunky, leathery wallet. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1542.7199999999998s)]
*  It's throwing your spine out. It's not cool looking. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1545.88s)]
*  The Ridge is unique, slim. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1549.0400000000002s)]
*  Its modern design holds up to 12 cards plus cash. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1550.88s)]
*  Everything you need. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1554.64s)]
*  It's made with premium materials like aluminum, titanium and carbon fiber. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1555.8000000000002s)]
*  They just look awesome. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1560.3200000000002s)]
*  There's over 50 colors and styles to choose from. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1561.64s)]
*  And they're all really cool. Check them out. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1564.1200000000001s)]
*  All Ridge products have a lifetime warranty. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1566.16s)]
*  This is literally the last wallet you'll ever have to buy. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1568.48s)]
*  There's a reason it has over 100,000 five star reviews. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1571.2800000000002s)]
*  So lose your old wallet and grab the Ridge. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1575.92s)]
*  They also have air track attachments. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1578.6000000000001s)]
*  So you'll always know exactly where it is before panic mode kicks in. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1580.88s)]
*  And right now, Ridge is having their once a year anniversary sale. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1584.3200000000002s)]
*  Get up to 40 percent off at ridge.com slash POTP 10. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1587.7600000000002s)]
*  That's ridge.com slash POTP 10 for up to 40 percent off. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1593.4s)]
*  All right, let's get back on the show. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1599.88s)]
*  Yeah, let's keep playing. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1601.64s)]
*  Interesting question is whether you're busy watering it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1603.0s)]
*  What should you not talk about mistakes that were made overall? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1606.0400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1610.0s)]
*  Right. All four go back and looking at. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1611.96s)]
*  So what are you? What is your argument then? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1614.2s)]
*  It's a very weird thing to go back, zone in on a man, say this one thing [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1615.92s)]
*  is a mistake and should characterize him and you ignore everything. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1621.48s)]
*  You're taking him out of. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1625.16s)]
*  Why? Just a second. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1626.8000000000002s)]
*  Just just to be clear here, what Douglas is arguing about. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1628.5200000000002s)]
*  So it had started on Darrell Cooper. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  Whose name Douglas says he doesn't know. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1635.12s)]
*  He literally goes Darren Cooper, Darrell Cooper, and then something like that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1637.52s)]
*  And then Joe asked him at one point if he had ever consumed any of his work. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1641.36s)]
*  He says, no, I don't need to. I don't know anything about him. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1644.6s)]
*  He's talking about one line he said on Tucker Carlson's podcast. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1647.0s)]
*  Then he's saying the problem with Darrell Cooper [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1651.32s)]
*  is that he takes a guy in Winston Churchill and judges him off one thing [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1654.1599999999999s)]
*  and doesn't look at his full body of work. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1658.8s)]
*  That's what he's arguing. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1666.12s)]
*  Does anybody see a problem there? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1668.12s)]
*  Ten dollars to the first for the first person who can point out [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1672.9199999999998s)]
*  the logical contradiction in that argument. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1676.1599999999999s)]
*  It's anyway, it's just unreal. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1680.7199999999998s)]
*  Let's keep playing. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1682.56s)]
*  When you're talking about Darrell, who's done. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1684.36s)]
*  What was it? Thirty plus hours. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1686.8s)]
*  So what? Thirty plus hours. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  But you take you do that in a week. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1690.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very, it's a very, very weird thing. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1692.9199999999998s)]
*  He's not doing a podcast like talking to people. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1695.9199999999998s)]
*  I got a noise. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1698.2399999999998s)]
*  What a stupid point. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1699.2399999999998s)]
*  Paul, is he working for a second? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1700.2399999999998s)]
*  Like, what a stupid point. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1702.04s)]
*  Like, if I if I let's say I read a book on tape, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1703.56s)]
*  which is really kind of what Darrell does with these things. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1707.6799999999998s)]
*  If I if I sit down like with the effort to script out like a book, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1710.1999999999998s)]
*  that is a different thing than like what me and you are doing right now. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1714.36s)]
*  And just count the hours that we've done this and then compare it to that. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1717.9599999999998s)]
*  That's like a written presentation, an oral presentation. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1721.4399999999998s)]
*  For 30 hours. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1725.0s)]
*  Do you know it like do you not see the difference between a 30 hour [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1726.9599999999998s)]
*  oral presentation going deep in depth on a topic and all of the players [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1730.72s)]
*  and all of the histories and what started every war and how the people suffered [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1735.4399999999998s)]
*  and what both sides you know what I'm saying? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1739.0s)]
*  Like that book. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1740.84s)]
*  Yes, it's a giant book. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1743.08s)]
*  It's not having a conversation with people like which is a challenge as well. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1744.4399999999998s)]
*  But like it's a totally different thing. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1748.36s)]
*  All right. Anyway, let's keep playing. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1750.72s)]
*  In the archives, clearly. Come on. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1752.76s)]
*  I mean, this is he is not the historian of our era. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1754.32s)]
*  He's not complaining to me. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1757.6s)]
*  This is the thing, Joe. This is like punching jelly. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1759.2s)]
*  No, but you don't you don't consider it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1761.9199999999998s)]
*  But you can't dance around his work. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1763.72s)]
*  I'm saying because I don't need to consume [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1765.6s)]
*  endless versions of a revisionist history. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1769.04s)]
*  I understand. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1771.28s)]
*  But it's not revisionist history. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1772.48s)]
*  If you listen to his work, it's not revisionist history. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1774.48s)]
*  He's basing it on historical. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1777.04s)]
*  But yeah, I know. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1779.28s)]
*  OK, so this is my point about jelly. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1780.84s)]
*  It's a shape shifting thing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  Comedian or historian. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1785.0800000000002s)]
*  He's not a comedian, historian or podcast. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1787.64s)]
*  Oh, it would be historian or actual historian. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1790.8400000000001s)]
*  You say he doesn't claim to be a historian, but he's pumping out tens of hours of history. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  Dan Carlin, he doesn't claim to be a historian either. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1798.1200000000001s)]
*  You see my point about the move. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1801.3200000000002s)]
*  Pause it. Pause it for a second. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1803.0s)]
*  Exactly, Joe. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1805.64s)]
*  But why doesn't he have a problem with Dan Carlin? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1807.28s)]
*  Oh, because Dan Carlin isn't telling the truth about Israel. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1809.92s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1813.68s)]
*  It's just it's nothing but a tactic to get the guy who's arguing the point [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1814.76s)]
*  you don't like rather than fucking addressing any arguments. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1818.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's keep playing. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1822.96s)]
*  Weird Jiu-Jitsu move. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1825.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't where you say, hang on, you know all about this as well. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1827.2s)]
*  You say, I'm not a historian, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1830.24s)]
*  but I'm going to spend my time talking about history. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1833.64s)]
*  I'm not a journalist, but I'm going to spend my time talking about this thing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1836.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm not an expert on this, but I'm going to spend my time talking about this thing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1839.8s)]
*  It's a weird move. Yeah. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1843.6s)]
*  No, you don't think? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  No, I'm a free American. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1846.24s)]
*  I can talk about what I like to. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1847.44s)]
*  So I don't. So what is the point here? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1848.9199999999998s)]
*  You can. But so we all can. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1850.6399999999999s)]
*  The point is, what are you pushing? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1853.24s)]
*  What are you watering? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1855.44s)]
*  What am I pushing? Yes. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1857.08s)]
*  Liberty, free markets, peace, prosperity, not getting in another stupid, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1858.76s)]
*  catastrophic war, which we're on the precipice of right now. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1863.24s)]
*  That's what I'm pushing. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1865.9199999999998s)]
*  What are we on the precipice of? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1866.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I think you weren't you just talking about it the other day. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1868.24s)]
*  Everyone I hear on the inside says we're about to attack around. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1870.2s)]
*  I think you just said something about that the other day. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1875.4s)]
*  Am I wrong about that? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1877.08s)]
*  I thought I saw in one of your interviews that you did. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1877.92s)]
*  Possibly. No. OK. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1879.6s)]
*  That doesn't mean we are on the verge of a war. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1881.16s)]
*  I mean, you keep referring to we being in wars. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1883.16s)]
*  There's a very big difference between a country having a military that's engaged [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1885.72s)]
*  and a country being at war. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1891.16s)]
*  This country has not been at war for 25 years. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1893.28s)]
*  You have not been fighting for the American homeland for 25 years. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1896.0s)]
*  Yes, we haven't. That's true. We haven't had a war on our shores. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1899.0s)]
*  We've been picking on third world countries halfway around the world. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1901.32s)]
*  Well, you haven't been randomly picking on them in Afghanistan. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1903.72s)]
*  You went I didn't say it was random. Yeah. Right. OK. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1907.28s)]
*  It wasn't like you suddenly. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1909.72s)]
*  Was it for a second? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1911.0s)]
*  Like, dude, it's just this was the whole thing is every point. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1912.56s)]
*  He's is just garbage. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1915.24s)]
*  Like everything he's it's just I don't know. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1917.08s)]
*  Do I even need to like point this out, Rob? It's just crazy. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1919.4s)]
*  It's like the the look, by the way, there's another. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1922.4s)]
*  The contradictions are wild. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1925.84s)]
*  But there's a how pedantic to stop over. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1927.4s)]
*  We've been at war. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1929.8s)]
*  And I go, you go, I go, yeah, no, I'm not suggesting the homeland's been attacked. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1931.32s)]
*  I'm saying we've been picking on these third world countries. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1935.0s)]
*  And he goes, you haven't been randomly. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1937.28s)]
*  I didn't say it was random. Obviously. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1939.28s)]
*  What what is this? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1941.16s)]
*  All right. Keep playing. Watch out for this. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1943.64s)]
*  Not going to get Myanmar or something. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1945.64s)]
*  You went to Afghanistan to find bin Laden [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1947.84s)]
*  and take revenge for 9-11 and stop an attack like that happening again [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1951.28s)]
*  on the American homeland is very different from a country being at war. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1955.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's a total mischaracterization of the war in Afghanistan. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1959.24s)]
*  It's one thing to say that might be an accurate characterization [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1962.1999999999998s)]
*  of the special operations mission in late 2001. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1964.8799999999999s)]
*  But then we thought then we thought a 20 year regime [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1967.76s)]
*  change war against the Taliban. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1970.32s)]
*  You got dragged into the quick sound of war. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1971.76s)]
*  Pause it. OK, fine. Pause it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1974.4799999999998s)]
*  He starts the thing by objecting to me saying we've been at war [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1979.8799999999999s)]
*  and ends it by saying because you got sucked into the quicksand of war. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1984.88s)]
*  Oh, so you just use the term you in the same way that I use the term we [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1990.88s)]
*  and then use the term war in the same way that I use the term war. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1995.76s)]
*  After that was your objection. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=1999.3600000000001s)]
*  He literally starts and then just completely contradicts it at the end. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2000.72s)]
*  I didn't even I'll tell you, I didn't even notice that one live. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2004.76s)]
*  It wasn't until I saw Chief Nerd posted this that I noticed that. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2008.28s)]
*  But I was like, oh, you literally ended it by saying you got sucked into war. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2013.04s)]
*  So what the fuck are we talking about here? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2016.8400000000001s)]
*  Anyway, the thing I don't even know if it wasn't a war. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2019.52s)]
*  I was told by me. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2023.2s)]
*  So I'm saying he says he's objecting to me saying we've been at war [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2025.28s)]
*  because it's like, no, that's not really we. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2028.72s)]
*  But I was like, yeah, but that's the way people use the term way, you know, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2030.6000000000001s)]
*  like referring to your government's actions. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2033.3600000000001s)]
*  OK, fine. But then at the end, he goes, you've been at war. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2035.2s)]
*  So it's like, oh, you also implied you like talking. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2038.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2041.04s)]
*  You're using you implied and I'm using we implied. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2041.68s)]
*  Whatever. Let's keep playing. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2044.04s)]
*  Oh, I said it was a war. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2046.12s)]
*  It's your it's your use of we as if you're personally suffering this war. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2047.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2051.92s)]
*  When I say we we're tax payers, we pay for it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2052.56s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2054.88s)]
*  Doug, if I went back and corrected you on every time you've used the term [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2055.48s)]
*  we to refer to your government or something like that, like if I were to say, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2058.88s)]
*  oh, we just imposed tariffs on China, would you point out that I didn't? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2061.96s)]
*  And it was the Trump administration. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2065.36s)]
*  You take it obviously very personally and that's your right to do so, of course. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2066.72s)]
*  I'm just trying to make sure we're accurate. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2071.0s)]
*  What do you think I'm taking personally? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2072.56s)]
*  Just that the American Wars. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2074.92s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, I think they've they've killed hundreds of thousands of people [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2077.28s)]
*  and cost my country eight trillion dollars and and degraded my country very much. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2080.8s)]
*  And there's a very good argument to make on that. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2085.84s)]
*  I'm still slightly bemused about this move from [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2088.28s)]
*  I'm an expert on this and I have used to I'm a comedian. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2093.12s)]
*  I've never claimed to be an expert on anything. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2097.24s)]
*  Can you just pause again? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2099.32s)]
*  This is the problem, Joe. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2100.16s)]
*  It's it's so funny to go. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2101.64s)]
*  That's a great argument. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2103.0s)]
*  And people should really have that discussion. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2104.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like that's what we're here to do. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2106.96s)]
*  I thought. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2108.3199999999997s)]
*  But I'm confused. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2110.2s)]
*  Do it then. So what's the other side of it? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2111.16s)]
*  To me, present the argument. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2114.12s)]
*  That is just so wild. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2117.8399999999997s)]
*  It's so well, it's just I don't know what any again it's. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  And the reason, look, like I said, like the comments have overwhelmingly just been [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2122.0s)]
*  like, yeah. And again, as you can see here, it's really not anything I'm doing. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2125.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm there and I'm me and I'm arguing my points, but it's just it's all [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2129.44s)]
*  the stuff he's doing. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2133.16s)]
*  That's just like this is too easy to see through. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2134.16s)]
*  This is garbage. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2136.08s)]
*  And I did notice it's like I got a lot of comments. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2137.28s)]
*  But why do I have to hear it from a peasant? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2141.44s)]
*  And why do I even have to address it? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2144.32s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2147.44s)]
*  And this is kind of how you you measure these things in a way, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2148.12s)]
*  because there's always a certain percentage of people who have like their feet dug in, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2150.8s)]
*  who aren't going to move. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2154.12s)]
*  Like I said before, when you have guys with a big enough audience, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2154.88s)]
*  you know, there's enough of their hardcore fans who no matter what are going to say, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2158.56s)]
*  yeah, they want. And I do got to say, I think some in a way, I think some low IQ [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2162.2s)]
*  people are kind of fooled by his bravado and just the it's all delivery and performance, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2166.7599999999998s)]
*  but no substance at all. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2172.8399999999997s)]
*  Nothing. But I got a lot of people who were saying to me, man, I actually was kind of [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2174.64s)]
*  a Douglas Murray fan until this. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2180.2799999999997s)]
*  Like they just he just laid it on so thick that it kind of exposed like, look, man, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2182.12s)]
*  all of this, it's not it's so obviously evasive to just write like you said, Rob, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2186.48s)]
*  admit like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2190.84s)]
*  What you're actually saying has a point. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2191.96s)]
*  But let me move back to some other. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2194.28s)]
*  And then this claim again, like it's. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2196.84s)]
*  I mean, this there's must have been said so many times you present yourself as an expert. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2200.64s)]
*  I'm not an expert. I'm just talking about these things. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2204.28s)]
*  You're allowed to talk about these things. OK, great. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2206.44s)]
*  So then what's the problem here? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2208.6s)]
*  Well, the problem is you go back and forth from expert to comedian. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2210.0s)]
*  It's like, well, what do you mean by that? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2212.92s)]
*  I mean, look, let's keep playing and then we'll kind of get into that that point a [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2214.96s)]
*  little bit more. I mean, if if if somebody says you have to claim to be an expert on [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2218.2400000000002s)]
*  something to have an opinion on something, you don't have to be. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2223.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't have to be. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2225.96s)]
*  But this is like I'm not a historian, but I'm pumping out history. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2226.92s)]
*  But what do I want to know? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2230.52s)]
*  Next, but I'm talking all the time about. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2231.2000000000003s)]
*  But you're not even talking about specifically on what he just said. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2233.16s)]
*  No, I'm saying this is my point about this. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2236.2400000000002s)]
*  You say I'm not an expert. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2239.0s)]
*  So is it so they're like God bless Joe Rogan. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2241.4s)]
*  Because he's really he is trying to keep it civil and be as nice as possible. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2245.16s)]
*  But he's just like, it sure does seem like the thing you're saying doesn't at all [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2248.92s)]
*  address the very reasonable thing that he just said, like what that you even [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2252.52s)]
*  admitted was reasonable. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2256.08s)]
*  So like you got anything for that? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2257.16s)]
*  I just know anything except arguing any of the wars, anything except actually [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2258.8s)]
*  putting up a debate, putting up grappling with anything I'm saying. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2263.6s)]
*  All right, let's play the last little bit. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2268.8s)]
*  Did not talk about it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2271.32s)]
*  No, it's to have more experts around. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2272.4s)]
*  Well, the expert hasn't done a great job. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2276.36s)]
*  This is followed the science. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2278.56s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2279.92s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2280.8s)]
*  I just said to you, I agree with that. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2281.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2283.6400000000003s)]
*  So Douglas, during all of COVID, I will put my track record against any of the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2283.92s)]
*  expert class on COVID. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2289.04s)]
*  I'm glad to do that. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2291.04s)]
*  So should I have just shut up? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2292.56s)]
*  Should I have shut up by opposing lockdowns and opposing vaccine mandates? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2293.76s)]
*  And so that was the argument at the time you realize that's the entire argument [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2297.1200000000003s)]
*  that you're making. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2300.4s)]
*  Let the expert handle this. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2301.12s)]
*  He's not. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2303.44s)]
*  No, it's like it's like, and he has the nerve to say that me and Joe were like [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2304.84s)]
*  jelly. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2310.44s)]
*  It's like, like, dude, you couldn't pin him down on anything, anything he says. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2311.6s)]
*  He won't just stand for. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2315.48s)]
*  And, and, you know, look, I'm sorry, this, this thing to this claim, which people [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2316.52s)]
*  try to make, right? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2323.24s)]
*  I mean, he's the only one I've ever had actually like try to make this in a [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2324.88s)]
*  debate, but I've seen other people like say it online and stuff. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2327.56s)]
*  But the idea that it's like, Hey, look, you're just a comedian and you present [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2330.8399999999997s)]
*  yourself as this expert, but then you always have this like parachute like, Oh, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2335.48s)]
*  but I'm just a comedian. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2340.48s)]
*  Um, first of all, which Douglas later at the debate directly accused me of, like [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2342.6s)]
*  that's what he said. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's just like, I don't know how many times I have to say it to him. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2348.96s)]
*  He has to be like a drunk woman and just pretend he hasn't heard it every single [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2351.7999999999997s)]
*  time and keep saying it again. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2355.96s)]
*  There's really no contradiction here. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2357.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't put myself out as the expert. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2360.9199999999996s)]
*  I never sit here on the show and say, I'm the in all of the issues that we talk [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2364.2s)]
*  about, okay, Rob, like all the big issues that we've been known for. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2368.48s)]
*  It is, doesn't it always go without saying, and I think I probably repeat it [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2373.24s)]
*  quite a bit. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2377.24s)]
*  I say the words, I'm not an expert quite a lot. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2378.4399999999996s)]
*  Actually, I make that very clear. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2381.3199999999997s)]
*  Obviously when we were talking, is there any confusion? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2383.8399999999997s)]
*  Does anybody who listens to this show, does anybody you think who listens to me [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2386.4s)]
*  on Joe Rogan, if I'm talking about, um, the, the wars in whatever country, if I'm [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2389.76s)]
*  talking about, if I was talking about the COVID COVID, does anybody think that I'm [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2395.92s)]
*  claiming to be a virologist or an epidemiologist or somebody who has studied [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2399.7200000000003s)]
*  this, my hope that is the expert on the issue. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2404.32s)]
*  Am I ever no, every time I'm going there, what I do on, on this show too, is I, I [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2406.7200000000003s)]
*  always bend over backward to flood people with the experts that have informed me [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2412.28s)]
*  and with the experts who I think are getting it right. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2417.48s)]
*  And yeah, like I said, I'm a free American. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2420.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm allowed to have opinions on things and make arguments and be like, I, this [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2421.88s)]
*  guy's case is stronger than this guy's case. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2425.28s)]
*  And no, I'm not an expert in any of the things that we talk about, but I am right [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2427.2000000000003s)]
*  about just about all of them. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2432.4s)]
*  And I have, and me and you, Rob, I'm sorry, we've been right about all the major [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2434.88s)]
*  issues over the last few years. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2438.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2439.4s)]
*  It's just the facts. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2440.12s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2441.12s)]
*  And then when, when it's this thing, it's like, I also have been doing standup [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2442.24s)]
*  comedy for like 20 years and I tour all around the country and do standup comedy. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2446.44s)]
*  I do both of those things. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2451.36s)]
*  I talk on a podcast about my views and I also do standup comedy and people who [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2453.2s)]
*  come out and see the shows, enjoy them and have a very good time. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2457.88s)]
*  I make a nice living doing both. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2460.72s)]
*  There's no contradiction there. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2463.36s)]
*  And as for this thing that it's like a parachute has been a big issue for me [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2465.0s)]
*  this thing that it's like a parachute. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2468.44s)]
*  Has there ever been a time in little? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2469.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2472.48s)]
*  There, there was one time, one time, literally. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2472.6800000000003s)]
*  It was when I debated Sam Cedar, I was very green. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2477.28s)]
*  This was a long time ago. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2482.08s)]
*  I, this has gotta be Jesus Christ. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2483.1600000000003s)]
*  10 years ago, at least I think over 10, I think maybe closer to 15, I think. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2485.04s)]
*  But regardless, it was like a Brown 15 years ago and it was a phone call into [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2490.48s)]
*  the thing, whatever I did. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2497.36s)]
*  I just did a bad job. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2498.24s)]
*  I had a bad, you know, I had a bad debate. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2499.2s)]
*  Um, and then I do think at one point in that debate, I was like, look, dude, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2501.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not the expert, I'm just a comedian, but blah, blah, blah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2505.04s)]
*  I think this, and I remember people giving me shit for saying that. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2507.3999999999996s)]
*  And, um, I think that's the only time I've ever said it. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2510.52s)]
*  Uh, has there ever been a time recently where like, I've made a point. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2513.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I really believe this, someone made a counter argument to that. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2518.2s)]
*  And then my response was, well, Hey, I'm just a comedian. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2522.4799999999996s)]
*  I don't know what I'm talking about. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2524.7599999999998s)]
*  No, I never do that. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2525.6s)]
*  So there's nothing here to what he's talking about. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2527.88s)]
*  It's like, he's basically like, he doesn't think it's just a [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2530.72s)]
*  pure argument for credentialism. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  He doesn't think I should get to be on huge shows, making these points. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2535.64s)]
*  But you know what, Douglas, you're not in control of the world because there's a [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2539.4s)]
*  free market of ideas to some extent and you don't get to decide that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2542.7599999999998s)]
*  And this is the way it is. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2547.44s)]
*  I am here on the show with you. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2548.44s)]
*  The thing is once you're here on the show with me, you got to actually [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2550.16s)]
*  engage, have an argument, have some idea. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2554.4s)]
*  You can't just sit here and talk about how you should. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2557.56s)]
*  It shouldn't be me here. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2560.08s)]
*  Joe shouldn't be having us on. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2562.16s)]
*  He should only have people on who agree with you. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2563.7999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the other side, we are like quite happy to have everybody on. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2566.84s)]
*  Let's, let's have the debate. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2571.2s)]
*  Um, so yeah, anything else, uh, anything else that you, uh, that stuck out to you [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2573.92s)]
*  that we should, uh, we should bring up. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2578.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, it just on that point, it's the fun thing about experts is they can correct us. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2580.44s)]
*  I could stand up in front of a mathematician and go two plus two equals a four. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2584.12s)]
*  And I'll be like, well, that was right. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2588.2799999999997s)]
*  And then if I said something really stupid, he'd go, that was wrong. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2589.68s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2592.48s)]
*  I might not be an expert in American immigration policy, but I could tell you [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2593.08s)]
*  that during the Biden administration, they were clearly pulling something to get as [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2596.68s)]
*  many people across the border as possible. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2600.7599999999998s)]
*  And when they said, Hey, we need to legalize 5,000 people a day before we have [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2603.24s)]
*  the authority to close the border. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2607.48s)]
*  I don't need to be an expert in United States law to go, that [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2609.52s)]
*  sounds like bullshit to me. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2612.4s)]
*  And you know how many topics we did that for all of COVID we've done that for [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2614.24s)]
*  hundreds of topics to go, Hey, I'm listening to the argument that the expert [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2617.4s)]
*  class is putting forward the, what the, the information that the experts want us [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2621.4s)]
*  to believe, and I'm calling bullshit. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2626.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2628.52s)]
*  And guess, and guess what? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2628.72s)]
*  If it was as dumb as me standing up in front of a mathematician and going two [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2630.04s)]
*  plus two equals five, it would be really easy to correct us, but the expert class [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2633.4s)]
*  is a very good, uh, has done a very good job of lying and shilling for the regime, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2637.84s)]
*  which is what leaves space for non-experts like us to have platforms and comment on [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2642.6000000000004s)]
*  things to just go, Hey, I think the entire expert class or a large majority of the [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2648.0400000000004s)]
*  expert class is lying to us. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2651.6000000000004s)]
*  Or sometimes just sit down and really cipher through a lot of the information [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2653.4s)]
*  from the expert class and go, wow, there's a lot of people who are lying about this, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2657.32s)]
*  but that John Mearsham, my guy seems to be making some really good arguments [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2660.96s)]
*  about the Ukraine war. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2664.44s)]
*  I've been reading all the coverage and everyone's been lying to me and telling [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2666.0s)]
*  me that we're going to win this war and we just have to support it. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2669.1200000000003s)]
*  And that Putin's going to take over all of Europe. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2671.92s)]
*  And I don't know, that just doesn't sound right. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2673.84s)]
*  And then you keep reading the information. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2676.32s)]
*  You keep seeing that we're not winning the war, that none of that information is [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2677.7999999999997s)]
*  true. And then you find the other experts here. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2681.04s)]
*  Like he still listens to him. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2682.52s)]
*  You're like, I kind of like this expert and you rehash that information. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2683.4s)]
*  I don't know, kind of doing a service of, uh, you know, going through everything [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2686.4s)]
*  and just putting forward your critical reasoning. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2690.92s)]
*  So I don't really, I, I just don't get the, it, I mean, it's blanket. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2694.08s)]
*  It's obvious what he's doing. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2698.52s)]
*  It's this appeal to authority that only people like me who want to spew my [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2699.64s)]
*  talking point should be allowed to have a voice. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2704.72s)]
*  And so if you're not spewing exactly what I think people should know, uh, which [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2707.2s)]
*  we don't really want to have to contend with other people's arguments about, then [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2712.3599999999997s)]
*  you shouldn't be platformed. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2715.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2717.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2718.12s)]
*  That's, that's all exactly right. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2719.0s)]
*  And, you know, I will say, um, that there's, there's something to it. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2720.6s)]
*  And, and perhaps, you know, like there's always, whenever you do these debates, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2724.44s)]
*  there's always like, Oh, I should have said this, or I should have said this. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2727.64s)]
*  And, you know, the thing about it is, is like, I feel a little almost like, man, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2730.16s)]
*  I, you know, I should have gone a little bit harder and been a little more [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2734.0s)]
*  vicious at times, but at the same time, I think Joe was happy that it went this [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2736.8399999999997s)]
*  way. And so I, you know, and I, that may, I don't know, I got a lot of people [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2740.3199999999997s)]
*  like messaging me, um, saying like they were, they thought it was great that I [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2744.08s)]
*  was so like patient and so like, was it to not get frustrated and lose my shit? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2748.36s)]
*  Um, and then I got other people messaging me like, Oh, I wanted you to [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2753.24s)]
*  fucking smash him and blah, blah, blah. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2756.32s)]
*  And I will say, even though the ones who are complimenting me, you know, I, I, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  I want to agree with the people complimenting me, but my heart is totally [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2763.92s)]
*  with the people who are like, you should have been a little more vicious. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2768.6400000000003s)]
*  Cause I'm like, I, but it is just, um, I guess the thing that's so kind of [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2770.92s)]
*  infuriating about this, this obvious debate tactic, which is again, is a [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2776.2400000000002s)]
*  tactic to avoid the debate, to come in there, to do anything except debate with [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2782.1200000000003s)]
*  me is that you immediately come in, you know, it's like, so we kind of live, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2786.2s)]
*  as everyone knows, we're kind of broadly in this new world where, okay, the kind [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2791.04s)]
*  of the dominant internet censorship culture kind of faded away in a [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2797.9199999999996s)]
*  remarkably short period of time. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2804.7599999999998s)]
*  Like we literally went from a time where like, it kind of looked like the [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  handwriting was on the wall that a show like, you know, any dissident show was [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2810.88s)]
*  eventually going to get kicked off of all the major platforms. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2816.48s)]
*  And, you know, there was a time where like people were being debanked and being, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2820.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, banned across every single platform. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2825.7200000000003s)]
*  And at the same time, the Biden administration was trying to install a [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2828.1600000000003s)]
*  ministry of truth and there was kind of like that. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2831.48s)]
*  And now that's kind of, Elon bought Twitter, Trump wins a big election. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2833.8s)]
*  Like that's all kind of like receded. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2837.1200000000003s)]
*  And now you have a little bit more of an open, you know, discourse. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2839.52s)]
*  And of course, when that happens, the dissident voices, the voices who hate [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2843.04s)]
*  the regime, they get more of a chance to get their voice out there. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2847.72s)]
*  And so you get a lot more of this stuff bubbling up. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2852.6s)]
*  And this includes people who are just like against the policies of the regime. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2854.9199999999996s)]
*  And it also includes people who are conspiracy theorists. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2860.64s)]
*  Some of them, you know, are more on point than others. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2863.0s)]
*  But there's something about like the role that people like Douglas Murray play [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2867.88s)]
*  and the trick they use to come in and go like, the first thing I want to talk [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2873.0s)]
*  about is I want you to feel bad about yourself for the fact that I think the [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2878.32s)]
*  conspiracy that you thought is wrong or you haven't called that this person who [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2883.6400000000003s)]
*  has this conspiracy or this person who has that conspiracy. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2888.04s)]
*  And it's like, dude, come on. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2891.2000000000003s)]
*  Like even what he admitted there about COVID, like he admitted there was a [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2893.56s)]
*  giant conspiracy that and what was that conspiracy that the fucking thing [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2897.12s)]
*  do that the fucking pandemic that the entire corporate media and the entire [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2902.6s)]
*  media class used to install totalitarian lockdowns was a fucking lie that they [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2907.12s)]
*  had made the goddamn virus and then lied to cover it up and then instituted [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2913.7599999999998s)]
*  totalitarianism and then gave giant banker bailouts and corporate bailouts [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2918.7999999999997s)]
*  and then forced a bullshit jab on billions of people. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2924.12s)]
*  I mean, like the fucking the current president of the United States of America, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2929.08s)]
*  who is I think the most popular political figure in America today, was framed for [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2933.6s)]
*  treason by his own deep state. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2938.2400000000002s)]
*  They tried to smear him as a traitor to his country. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2941.0s)]
*  Then they tried to throw him in jail. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2944.36s)]
*  And then coincidentally, nothing to do with that at all. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2946.84s)]
*  But the sniper did get a clean shot at his head from 130 yards away. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2949.12s)]
*  And, you know, whatever, it's just that that has nothing to do with anything. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2952.7599999999998s)]
*  And sure, he had been in a couple of Black Rock commercials and there's no data on [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2955.7599999999998s)]
*  any of his phones or whatever. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2958.7999999999997s)]
*  But yes, this place had been professionally swiped. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2959.7599999999998s)]
*  Whatever that I'm saying, that part's unrelated completely. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2962.48s)]
*  But anyway, is it? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2965.3199999999997s)]
*  And so in this environment where there is this just like, you know, also like there [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2966.96s)]
*  was a freaking pedophile ring that can't must be there's a pedophile ring that [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2971.08s)]
*  involves all the most powerful cultural and political figures in the United [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2977.7999999999997s)]
*  States of America. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2981.2799999999997s)]
*  And the details of it have to be redacted for national security purposes. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2982.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, like and then your response to that is to come in and just counter signal [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2987.24s)]
*  against anybody who's a conspiracy theorist, anybody out there who might be a little [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2992.3599999999997s)]
*  sloppy the way they're putting dots together rather than you know what I'm saying? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=2997.08s)]
*  Like there's just something about that that's like and then not just that, but then [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3001.2s)]
*  to like try to shame other people for not also counter signaling them like, hey, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3004.56s)]
*  motherfucker, it's totally reasonable for me to say, all right, you know what? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3009.44s)]
*  I don't agree with a lot of the conspiracy. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3012.56s)]
*  As I say on my show, sometimes if a conspiracy comes up, I go, yeah, I think people [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3014.48s)]
*  are jumping to conclusions there. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3017.8s)]
*  I don't think that's right. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3018.88s)]
*  People know what I say. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3020.0s)]
*  I say what my views are. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3021.16s)]
*  But no, I don't have to spend all my time counter signaling when other people who [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3022.92s)]
*  hate the government class like get it wrong, maybe or go a little bit too far. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3026.88s)]
*  Because like I could just it's totally reasonable for me to say, no, I'm going to [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3031.76s)]
*  focus on this criminal regime and my outrage for them. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3035.4s)]
*  And then especially when like, you know, the policy again, the policy that Douglas [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3038.92s)]
*  is advocating is so much more evil than pushing like one of these conspiracy [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3044.1600000000003s)]
*  theories. And of course, that's why he doesn't want to actually defend that. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3049.08s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3052.96s)]
*  is my patriot supply. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3056.32s)]
*  You've heard me talk about them before because I trust them when it comes to my [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3057.92s)]
*  family's well-being. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3061.4s)]
*  And I just got word they're doing something they've never done before. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3062.7599999999998s)]
*  Right now, you can get the best selling mega three month emergency food kit [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3065.72s)]
*  supply for the same price as the standard kit. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3070.2799999999997s)]
*  That's more than three hundred and sixty dollars of real beef, real chicken, farm [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3073.3199999999997s)]
*  fresh fruits, vegetables included at no extra cost. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3078.24s)]
*  Even better, the kit now gives you twenty five hundred calories a day more than any [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3081.8399999999997s)]
*  other emergency food supply I've seen. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3086.7599999999998s)]
*  And let's be honest, when things go sideways, you're going to need more than [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3089.24s)]
*  just survival. You need strength. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3092.88s)]
*  You need energy. You need real food. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3094.64s)]
*  Look, this is something that for me personally, after the covid insanity, I [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3096.7599999999998s)]
*  will always make sure I have a supply of food. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3101.24s)]
*  I get it from my patriot supply. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3104.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a great company. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3107.2799999999997s)]
*  Go check out my website, prepare with Smith dot com and claim your mega kit. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3108.52s)]
*  Well, it's this offer lasts. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3112.96s)]
*  That's prepare with Smith dot com. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3114.72s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3117.52s)]
*  That's why he'd like to. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3119.4s)]
*  And look, I will say I think he in a way made an effort. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3120.6s)]
*  And to the extent that he was successful, it's that we only really talked about [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3124.48s)]
*  the war for a pretty short period of time considering how long the podcast was. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3128.2s)]
*  But when we were talking about that, he didn't land one blow. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3133.12s)]
*  He didn't take on one point. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  It was always just this stuff. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3139.44s)]
*  And then the problem is just that his tactics were so transparent that it just [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3141.7999999999997s)]
*  seems like people saw through it. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3145.72s)]
*  It's just, you know, it's just you can't if you watch this at all with an open [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3147.28s)]
*  mind, you're going to be and that's why. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3151.88s)]
*  Look, the reality is that I'm getting like I said, I've been flooded with people [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3154.36s)]
*  saying, like, you know, either like. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3159.7200000000003s)]
*  I actually used to really like Douglas Murray. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3162.5600000000004s)]
*  I lost a lot of respect for him on this. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3164.5600000000004s)]
*  I came in neutral, but yeah, he just didn't put up a fight. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3166.5600000000004s)]
*  I got a lot of people saying, I still disagree with you on the issue, but like, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3169.32s)]
*  yeah, he really didn't argue, you know, he lost the debate on his bullshit arguments. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3172.4s)]
*  And I'm sure I'm sure there are some people who are like have their feet planted [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3180.52s)]
*  are fans of his and think he won the debate. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3183.84s)]
*  I saw a couple of people posting that. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3185.52s)]
*  Yeah, he exposed Dave when he showed that he's never been there or whatever. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  It's just too dumb. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3191.4s)]
*  But. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3192.6400000000003s)]
*  You're not going to see anybody who like was like, oh, I was a huge Dave Smith fan. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3194.4s)]
*  And then this debate changed my mind about that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3199.8s)]
*  So that's kind of how you measure this. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3202.36s)]
*  These things you try to move the people in the middle. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3204.2000000000003s)]
*  I guess I was able to do a decent job of that. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3206.52s)]
*  Again, like I said, I think he lost a lot more than I won. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3208.96s)]
*  But that's I think that's as like any other thoughts, Rob. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3211.84s)]
*  I got one other thought. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3215.4s)]
*  I might not articulate this in the best way. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3216.84s)]
*  And I don't know, maybe maybe it's a it's a little bit too complicated. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3219.8s)]
*  So I don't want to steal any shine from your brilliant performance. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3223.6800000000003s)]
*  And listen, there were very flagrant tricks that he pulled. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3227.4399999999996s)]
*  There was the appeal to authority right off the bat. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3230.48s)]
*  Well, if you're such an expert, why don't we discuss the ideas? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3232.7599999999998s)]
*  There was the well, if you've never seen it, you can't have an opinion. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3235.2799999999997s)]
*  Just to speak to how much nonsense that is, I'm in New York City all the time. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3238.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't see an immigration problem. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3241.68s)]
*  If I was just going off of what I see, I go there's no immigration problem here. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3243.3999999999996s)]
*  But I can then read an article about the [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3246.96s)]
*  cost that it's done to New York City, and it's clearly a problem. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3248.6s)]
*  So I actually have better information [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3251.8799999999997s)]
*  from what I've read than from what I've seen. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3253.52s)]
*  And I mean, that's just one example. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3255.52s)]
*  But like that's just such a that one's stupid. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3257.2400000000002s)]
*  Also, the argument of like selectively picking from government sources. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3260.08s)]
*  You know, like, I don't know if during Covid, the New York Times said, hey, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3265.1200000000003s)]
*  the Johnson and Johnson shot is bad. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3268.92s)]
*  And I go, look, even the New York Times is telling you that this one's bad. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3270.96s)]
*  And you go, oh, well, suddenly you believe the New York Times. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3273.6800000000003s)]
*  No, I think the New York Times has been [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3275.84s)]
*  showing a narrative the whole time, and when even they're going to concede this [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3277.7200000000003s)]
*  point, that's when I'm going to go look, that's how flagrant this is. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3281.2000000000003s)]
*  And so there's a bit of a flip on that one. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3285.4s)]
*  And then there was also just a lot of just [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3288.8s)]
*  wasting time and pulling a little finicky, oh, we, we, you know, like that kind of [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3290.96s)]
*  that kind of stupid thing, there was one other thing that stuck out to me. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3294.6s)]
*  And maybe you can better articulate than me. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3298.44s)]
*  But I feel like on some of this talk, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3300.96s)]
*  like some of these topics, all that you're really left with, because the government [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3303.2000000000003s)]
*  does a good job of not leaving a clean track record of its own crimes. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3307.1600000000003s)]
*  Like even look at Pat Fauci post Covid. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3310.8s)]
*  I said that I said that I was [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3313.1600000000003s)]
*  making a recommendation, I was passing this to that. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3315.12s)]
*  Like, so you take the situation in Syria, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3317.2799999999997s)]
*  in which he was trying to make the case that we weren't involved or that's, you [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3320.96s)]
*  know, why you look at it was a smaller factor. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3324.2s)]
*  OK, now I can't I I'm not an expert. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3327.24s)]
*  I can't point to specific proof of the fact [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3330.52s)]
*  the United States government managed to overthrow Assad at the end of the Biden [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3332.88s)]
*  administration, but the fact that there was Ukrainian stuff over there that Israel [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3336.52s)]
*  stepped in, took over military bases and the relationship that we've had in the [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3340.64s)]
*  past working with groups such as Al Qaeda in the region, while saying the moderate [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3344.68s)]
*  rebels, yeah, I can't prove to you that that was America. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3349.44s)]
*  But I think there's also at the very least, if you if you arm and back a group [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3352.64s)]
*  and they try to overthrow the government and it fails and then years later they try [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3359.0s)]
*  to throw the government and it succeeds, even if we don't have the proof yet, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3363.3199999999997s)]
*  which we might well get in the future, we'll say that there was direct American [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3367.16s)]
*  involvement in the second time you still back to the group. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3371.44s)]
*  The first time it was still your [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3374.28s)]
*  intervention that ultimately led to this outcome. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3376.1200000000003s)]
*  And of course, this is the game that they play a lot. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3378.96s)]
*  But like the whole point is like everybody who studies this shit knows, right? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3381.6800000000003s)]
*  The whole game of CIA backed coups is always to like move the needle enough [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3386.1200000000003s)]
*  with as little a footprint as necessary. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3393.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. So like maybe there's a an uprising, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3396.2000000000003s)]
*  but the government is stronger and could put it down. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3399.48s)]
*  But like if you send some weapons in, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3401.48s)]
*  that'll be the difference between them taking over the government or not. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3403.68s)]
*  And then you could sit back and go, oh, it was just a little bit of weapons [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3407.48s)]
*  that we sent in. And it's like, yeah, but the point of sending it in is to make [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3410.32s)]
*  the difference. That's the whole game. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3413.32s)]
*  State a little bit differently. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3415.0s)]
*  And I'll bring I'll give another example. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3416.32s)]
*  If we can only trust the expert class and we can only criticize government, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3418.28s)]
*  if there's direct government evidence, how do you ever question government policy [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3422.88s)]
*  or if it's in our interest? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3427.8s)]
*  And so another example would be there was a long discussion about, you know, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3429.9199999999996s)]
*  Israel's tactics in terms of what it's been doing in Gaza. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3435.16s)]
*  And, you know, I've said it a lot. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3439.2s)]
*  I actually don't know the history of the situation, but I look at what's going on [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3441.3199999999997s)]
*  there and I just don't think you can kill civilians in the way that the Israeli [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3444.52s)]
*  government has been doing so. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3448.56s)]
*  And so he's trying to walk the line of, well, although they're doing it, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3450.3999999999996s)]
*  they don't intend to do it. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3454.72s)]
*  And now all insert conjecture once again. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3456.2s)]
*  I've heard of programs like Daddy's Home, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3458.72s)]
*  which they're waiting until someone goes back into a building. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3461.08s)]
*  I'm looking at all these homes being bombed. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3464.3999999999996s)]
*  And then he wants to say, well, that's because the booby traps after the fact. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3466.64s)]
*  Well, I've even read stories of and once again, conjecture, I've read stories [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3469.7999999999997s)]
*  of the Israeli government sending Palestinians in to set off the booby trap. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3474.64s)]
*  I don't know if that's true or not, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3478.08s)]
*  but I've certainly just seen the Israeli government lie about, oh, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3479.56s)]
*  there's no it was a it was a haretz piece where they spoke to a couple different [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3483.16s)]
*  IDF soldiers. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3487.68s)]
*  So it's, you know, again, like you never know for sure with these things, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3489.8399999999997s)]
*  but it seems like a pretty like just to take it as a given with all the death [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3493.3199999999997s)]
*  that's happened in the area at the beginning of the war. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3498.52s)]
*  I just remember this example where they bombed that first hospital and they said [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3500.8399999999997s)]
*  it was a main base and they were pointing to the tunnels. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3503.68s)]
*  Then it turned out that Israel had the tunnels. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3505.6s)]
*  And then when they said, look at the military gear, it was less than I've seen [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3507.6s)]
*  in police raids in New York City on gangs. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3510.48s)]
*  So like there might have been a presence there, but to say it was the main base [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3512.64s)]
*  and then to just say, well, I should just give it as an absolute given [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3515.48s)]
*  that that Israel's working in a very moral capacity. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3518.6400000000003s)]
*  So, sure, I'm working off conjecture when I go. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3522.1200000000003s)]
*  Firstly, I think that this death is outrageous. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3524.6000000000004s)]
*  And yes, I also just can kind of deduce I think they're lying about the morality [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3527.0800000000004s)]
*  that they're handling it in the most honest and firstly, just telling someone [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3531.2400000000002s)]
*  that they can't be in their home and then just sending them off with no resources [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3535.32s)]
*  to return to empty rubble, like I don't even think that's acceptable. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3540.36s)]
*  But there seems to be like, how do you [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3543.7999999999997s)]
*  criticize anything if government works with the expert class and you need [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3546.8799999999997s)]
*  an expert class and then government doesn't keep perfect records of its crimes? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3551.16s)]
*  So at some point you have to kind of evaluate the conjecture of the situation. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3555.3599999999997s)]
*  And so if you're and then if you're just [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3559.0s)]
*  going to label that as conspiracy, which I would just say it's more just [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3560.6s)]
*  critical thinking, then how do you possibly criticize government from his perspective? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3564.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's, you know, look, the argument obviously is ridiculous, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3569.04s)]
*  but it's essentially he just tried to bring the Sam Harris argument there [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3573.16s)]
*  to scoff and say, no, we're above you. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3577.3999999999996s)]
*  We're smarter than you. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3581.44s)]
*  We're better than you will be the ones who decide. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3582.56s)]
*  And it's just like, you know, look, this is obviously the argument is elitist. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3585.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think wrong. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3590.12s)]
*  It's also just been widely rejected. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3591.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's, you know, to take that that ridiculous argument to like the Joe Rogan [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3593.44s)]
*  podcast audience just seemed so crazy to me. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3599.6s)]
*  It's almost like, you know, we disagree on so much. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3602.72s)]
*  Like if you take the broader like [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3606.12s)]
*  say, Joe Rogan's entire audience, you're talking, you know, millions and millions [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3608.7599999999998s)]
*  and millions of people, they are different points of view on a lot of different things. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3613.24s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of different people who are Democrats and Republicans. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3618.44s)]
*  There are there are people who are liberals and conservatives. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3621.8s)]
*  There are people who actually have probably like wildly left wing views [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3624.6s)]
*  and wildly right wing views who listen to Joe Rogan's podcast. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3628.52s)]
*  But like if there's one thing I feel like that there's just like [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3631.96s)]
*  consensus on is that we don't believe that, you know, we're not here because like, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3637.36s)]
*  oh, only the expert class gets to talk about issues. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3643.0800000000004s)]
*  That's the whole like concept of the show is like people, interesting people having [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3645.84s)]
*  interesting conversations. So, yeah, anyway, it was a quite an exhausting trip. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3650.6800000000003s)]
*  It's been a while. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3659.48s)]
*  Quite a run. I think I got a week in a comedy festival in the span of about five [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3661.92s)]
*  days. Yeah. And a fun weekend in in Boston right before that, too. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3666.5600000000004s)]
*  So I got I think I got a week off now, but I'm going to enjoy it. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfA4jtUHG5k&t=3670.6800000000003s)]
