*  Yeah, I go well I wasn't able to go last year. I was unfortunately sick the only weekend [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=167.61999999999998s)]
*  I believe I've ever canceled in my life and I've been like I've been sick before I was real sick at Skangfest [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=172.7s)]
*  This last year, but I've been sick, but it's always been like, you know, you could power through and like do it [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=180.73999999999998s)]
*  This was the only one where I was like I'm coming out of my eyeballs and you keep that to yourself [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  Oh, that's what I did. It's gang fest [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  But like could you know it cares anymore listen, first of all, no one cares anymore second old skank fest [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  They didn't care in March of 2020. You know what? I mean, like none of these people care and then it was like I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=196.86s)]
*  Don't know they're clearly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=202.02s)]
*  Skank fest I remember I was trying to explain this to dr. Drew's wife. I think this was two years ago. So [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=206.06s)]
*  Two years ago if you could put yourself in that place in kovat time, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=213.54000000000002s)]
*  So there's way past the point of me and you being well over this [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=217.10000000000002s)]
*  But you know, it's still a thing and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=220.9s)]
*  She had a fair argument. So he was a he had like a reunion for one of his shows [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=223.5s)]
*  What was the show teen mom or something like that? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=229.46s)]
*  Whatever version of that show that he was the host of they had like a big reunion like where are they now, you know [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=232.46s)]
*  spoiler alert not successful [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=238.62s)]
*  Don't have kids when you're a teenager so it's not the best path [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=244.06s)]
*  But so it was he was doing that and then he was like I really want to go to skank fest [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  It was like two weeks before that and she was like look if if he gets kovat at skank fest [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=252.42s)]
*  Then we lose this like huge money gig, you know [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=258.86s)]
*  And it's like there was a time where it's like if he tests positive and they're just not gonna do the the reunion and you know [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean she didn't tell me the number by imagine. It's a it's a nice chunk of change [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=267.94s)]
*  So I was like, okay listen, I get your point [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=270.52s)]
*  But I was like, let me try to make this argument and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  I was like and I'm talking to dr. Drew and his wife and I was like, you know, he's a doctor [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  So back me up on whether this is medical medically sound [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=279.62s)]
*  These are the filthiest people in the United States of America [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=283.68s)]
*  They have all clearly gotten kovat already. They're like this is actually the safest place to be these people live in germs [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  They're the safest and I remember dr. Drew goes he was like the science checks out [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=294.08s)]
*  Yeah, the Ethiopian mud babies that come to skank fest each year [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  So the long of the short is dr. Drew did not come to skank fest that year [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=302.56s)]
*  My argument was not convincing but he did come the following year [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  So something you know something got in there a little bit [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, lots to talk about today [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=312.28s)]
*  If you have any questions drop them in the live chat and we will try to address [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=314.08s)]
*  As many of them as we have time for by the way [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=318.68s)]

*  But it's not three days a week show [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=356.02s)]
*  It's a four day a week show, but you have to sign up in order to get that fourth episode. Okay [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=358.62s)]
*  So I guess the big news [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=363.94s)]
*  of the day [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=366.97999999999996s)]
*  Which is I find it totally fascinating is this stuff about Facebook or should I say about Metta? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=368.78s)]
*  Which is what Metta is the parent company of Facebook and that's I guess it's Facebook and Instagram [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=375.62s)]
*  And that metaverse thing never seem to take off. Yeah, and what is oculus? I don't think I it's the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=381.82s)]
*  Three things you yeah, I have it. I have it in the other room. I actually really liked that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=387.92s)]
*  I got into the boxing game for a while. It's a good. It's a good [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=392.84s)]
*  That it's a good hack to like [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=396.84s)]
*  Get cardio in but like you just think you're playing a game and fighting someone but man, do you look ridiculous? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=399.4s)]
*  Do that boxing game is a lot of fun so much fun so they do a really good job of making it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=407.92s)]
*  Like [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=414.24s)]
*  However, they they figured it out [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=415.40000000000003s)]
*  It is cool that like they they can measure like how much you're putting into it [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=416.92s)]
*  I'm like if you want to knock someone out, you've got to really land a clean shot [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=421.68s)]
*  The thing I liked about that game was also that was very realistic about it was that it wouldn't like if you just swing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=424.76s)]
*  Wildly, but with everything you have in it, you're not gonna knock guys out [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=432.2s)]
*  But if you like if you you could just put it like perfect placement and you can drop people and you're like, oh [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=435.56s)]
*  That's really what it's like [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=441.72s)]
*  Like it's more about like hitting someone right on the button than it is about just like swinging wildly [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=442.6s)]
*  You see you have a lot more technique than I do you just swing wildly [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=447.2s)]
*  I was not knocking people out in that game. I was throwing power punches, but I guess I don't know you got the thing about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=450.48s)]
*  The game I think is you got to like it's it [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=456.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm telling you if you go back and play it again instead of focusing on just throwing bombs [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=458.52s)]
*  Focus on perfectly placing it on the chin and you're gonna you're gonna get more knockdowns. All right [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=463.88s)]
*  I'm gonna coach you. I'm gonna make a successful fighter out of you yet [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=468.44s)]
*  okay, so I guess just [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=471.52s)]
*  Prefacing all of this which I don't know why I kind of almost feel the need to like disclose this [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=474.44s)]
*  upfront, but I do also find this whole topic of like internet censorship is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=479.56s)]
*  It's particularly I guess interesting to us because we're in this world and so it's a topic about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=485.56s)]
*  the industry that we are in or it's super relevant to that and [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=491.32s)]
*  Again with with Facebook I [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=496.56s)]
*  You know we we had our private group in in the part of the old part of the problem inner circle on Facebook [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  At which we got which got shut down in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=507.98s)]
*  2020 over the kovat stuff and I am a [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=512.12s)]
*  I'm still quite resentful about that. So it's like I you know [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  There's just kind of like putting my biases on the table at the beginning [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=520.24s)]
*  Like I am biased I do have my own angle on this and that's a big part of it [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=525.42s)]
*  and then separate from that as we've said many times I do just think that in the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=529.66s)]
*  Internet censorship is in many ways the most important issue because everything kind of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=536.78s)]
*  Follows from that, you know, like okay, the corporate press has been destroyed. Okay trust in institutions has evaporated [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=545.18s)]
*  Now we have you know these alternative voices [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=552.22s)]
*  But if we don't if they censor the internet, we're not gonna have these voices and then we're right back in the same situation [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=555.1s)]
*  So I'm I'm as I know you are to very strongly on the side of a free internet [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=560.5400000000001s)]
*  And and against censorship so that I guess just in the backdrop [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=567.62s)]
*  This is also something that's been building I guess for a while [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=574.0200000000001s)]
*  Zuckerberg has kind of come around [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=577.86s)]
*  Well, I'm curious. What do you think about the and we can play the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=580.38s)]
*  We'll get into the clip of him and then there's a clip of another guy from Metta. But what do you think about this? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=584.72s)]
*  this [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=590.02s)]
*  Transformation that we've seen over the last few years of Mark Zuckerberg. I [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=591.7s)]
*  think [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=596.54s)]
*  Not all these characters are inherently evil now. They might not be noble people [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=597.9s)]
*  They might not want to stand up for the greater good [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=602.86s)]
*  But some of these people just want to run businesses and they discover along the way that they can't just run businesses [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=605.62s)]
*  Because the mob will call them into their office and tell them hey [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=611.7s)]
*  We don't care that you're just a content platform and that you want to drive as much business here by making it open and interesting [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=614.66s)]
*  What we need you to do and here's your marching orders [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=622.46s)]
*  And so I don't think I think for some of these people like I think Google, you know, they might actually have [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=625.58s)]
*  Tie-ins with the CIA. I think they're like CNN. I don't think they just want to run an honest news network [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=632.06s)]
*  right, right, I think there are businesses out there that are highly tied into [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=637.38s)]
*  government initiatives or [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=641.9s)]
*  Specifically hijacking the government so that they don't have to compete in the market [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=644.18s)]
*  And then I think there's some people that would just want to run businesses [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=648.2s)]
*  I don't know that that's for sure is but there's something like I think the tech people got pulled in [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=651.1s)]
*  And we're told that basically you got to pick a team and you got to start paying somebody [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=657.22s)]
*  Because if not, you're gonna be in trouble [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=661.94s)]
*  I think that very specifically happened with Zuckerberg where they'll start screaming about safety this that the next thing they'll jam me up [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=663.34s)]
*  Even Microsoft had that all of a sudden an antitrust and instead of building, you know your business [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=670.5s)]
*  You're meeting with your lawyers trying to fight the government. Well, it's kind of like, you know, I [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=676.34s)]
*  Don't know it's it's a little bit of a weird situation because how much can you blame [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=682.3s)]
*  You know certain businessmen who are like look, this is the world I'm given and so I got to play this game [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=688.2s)]
*  Interestingly enough, you know, he's hiring [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=696.74s)]
*  Dana White and Dana White made the gamble during the last administration [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=699.5s)]
*  Business as usual and a lot of people won really big by saying businesses unit would kill Tony won real big [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=704.22s)]
*  I mean how many shows shut down and kill Tony's like we're still going [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=710.26s)]
*  Yeah, and it's you know [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=713.4200000000001s)]
*  So people people place that bit the last time around of going I'm not listening to this administration as they went full [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=714.82s)]
*  Hey, you're killing grandma unless you're playing into this Cove at dang [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  I think Zuckerberg was playing on Team Democrat up until we've seen this shift of just [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=723.9s)]
*  Do the ESG score thing is gone. The woke thing is gone. The green energy thing is gone. I think they tried to push [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=730.5s)]
*  More socialism than the market would actually tolerate and they just lost and so people like [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=737.88s)]
*  You know [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=743.92s)]
*  Zuckerpants was betting on we're gonna be full-scale socialism and I got to work within the machine and that entire thing [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  Has seemingly died. Yeah, look man. I look I get your point [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=752.24s)]
*  I think that's I think that's right and I also think there's also just like a [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=756.04s)]
*  human element of like [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=761.6s)]
*  Elon Musk kind of just became the cool kid in that space and I do think there it's Zuckerberg is a guy who listen [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=764.44s)]
*  Like we've talked about this a little bit on the show before but you know how sometimes like [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=775.28s)]
*  if you'll you'll see [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=780.0400000000001s)]
*  like like a male feminist or like a like a guy a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=782.76s)]
*  Dude who's super super progressive [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=787.56s)]
*  You know, maybe like a picture like whatever you want a picture like a 25 year old guy who has he him? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=790.64s)]
*  Pronouns in his Twitter bio and is like a super super progressive guy [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  Yes [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=801.04s)]
*  well [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=801.56s)]
*  but like you could be watching him and sometimes you'll be like I actually I just [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=801.8s)]
*  Think the difference between us is like our level of testosterone [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  Like I'm not sure this has anything to do with actually political arguments or anything like that [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=811.48s)]
*  I don't think I'm gonna change your mind because you were like man. That was a really compelling point that you made [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=816.56s)]
*  It's like you just need testosterone replacement and I don't know why you need it so young but something's going on [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=821.84s)]
*  I don't know what your diet is or what but like [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=827.52s)]
*  Zuckerberg is into MMA [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=830.68s)]
*  Okay, he's into MMA now. I don't know. He's an odd person [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=833.68s)]
*  I know there's all those jokes about how he's like really a robot or something like that, but he's just a weird [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=837.64s)]
*  Guy but I do think that he's at least if you're like doing jujitsu and you're a fan of the UFC [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=841.72s)]
*  You're at least enough of a dude that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=848.84s)]
*  There's just something about like oh, you're the free speech guy and you're getting a lot of love for that. That's just cool [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=852.64s)]
*  That's cooler than being the I'm the one who's in you know, like I'm doing content moderation [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=858.92s)]
*  How gay does that sound even just the words content moderation? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  Doesn't just sound like what is this for a kindergartener or an adult man? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=869.48s)]
*  You're moderating other people's content [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=874.84s)]
*  Anyway, my point is that there's just this kind of cool factor that I think played a plays a part in this as well [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=877.16s)]
*  I'm not trying to get too into like psychoanalyzing people. I try not to do that, but [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=882.64s)]
*  It okay, so on one hand this is kind of how I feel I'm going to put on a necklace [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=887.72s)]
*  Have curly hair [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=892.98s)]
*  Well, okay, so on one hand I do feel that like I'm somewhat sympathetic to people who are [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=897.22s)]
*  you know in in the world of [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=905.38s)]
*  big business and they're like look I [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=908.58s)]
*  Got to uh, I got to do what I got to do to be successful and I can't have the federal government as an enemy [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=911.86s)]
*  So I don't know what to tell you they got all the guns and they're telling me I have to do this [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=917.96s)]
*  So I'm gonna do this and be real successful over here. I'm somewhat sympathetic to that [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=922.02s)]
*  You know, it's kind of like if you're playing a game of basketball and you're just like, okay [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=925.26s)]
*  We're playing basketball here and you know, we're on a team and we're like, okay [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=929.74s)]
*  let's do a pick and roll and then look blah blah, whatever isolation on the left side and then [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=933.22s)]
*  The guy on the other team like punches you in the face and the ref doesn't call a foul the ref goes [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=938.6999999999999s)]
*  Nope, that was clean like at a certain point. You're like, oh well then [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=944.1s)]
*  Then like if we come back to the huddle and we're like hey, let's run the pick and roll again like we're the retards [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=948.22s)]
*  Right, like there's a certain point you gotta go. Oh, this is a different game [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=953.46s)]
*  Then we think it should be you know, the game is now that you can punch in the face. So now [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=956.0600000000001s)]
*  Forget thinking about the pick and roll so much like block your face and then punch back at this guy because that's the get [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=960.86s)]
*  We're fighting now. We're not playing basketball [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like the government changes things when it gets into the the market and I understand [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=967.0200000000001s)]
*  That people have to do what they have to do to survive. The other thing though is that it does [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=971.74s)]
*  With the Mark Zuckerberg thing it just feels it feels a little bit like I [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=976.9s)]
*  don't know maybe like if you were a Jew in Nazi Germany and then like, you know, someone downstairs is like those Jews in the [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=982.9s)]
*  Attic there's Jews up there go get them [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=990.02s)]
*  They're up there and then like the Nazi regime falls and then they're like that was crazy [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=992.38s)]
*  how they were rounding up Jews and everything right and you're just like [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=996.74s)]

*  And so I don't know. I guess both of those feelings are in my mind [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1006.94s)]

*  Don't know Colin Quinn just put out a new hour and he had a great joke in there about how [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1073.1799999999998s)]
*  Everyone yells about like the horrors of you're being a hypocrite. That's like yeah, it's not illegal. I'm being a hypocrite [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1078.34s)]
*  I don't know that that like that was basically the framing of the chair. Yeah, there's something along those lines [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1086.22s)]

*  To create a track record of people like us potentially being domestic terrorists. Look these people's ideas are so dangerous [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1123.92s)]
*  They had to be removed from the platform dude, and it was so I mean I can't I can't like [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  Overstate it it was so Orwellian the entire process. I mean if I so we've got this group [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  We had this group at the time called the part of the problem inner circle. It's a private Facebook group [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1146.08s)]
*  It's just a group for our listeners to talk with each other and talk with us and it was great [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1151.32s)]
*  I really loved having that group and [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1157.0s)]
*  so [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1160.0s)]
*  2020 comes right in March the the country's in lockdowns. It is the craziest freaking thing ever like you can't believe it [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1161.44s)]
*  I mean, I remember like, you know, it was a surreal time. I remember [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1168.52s)]
*  Being in in New York City [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1172.6000000000001s)]
*  At my mother's place. I'll literally never forget this as long as I live [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1175.48s)]
*  But it was the it was like a few days after lockdowns were implemented and we were at [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1178.88s)]
*  My in-laws house with our daughter son, it wasn't born yet, but we were there with our baby daughter [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1186.44s)]
*  she's like one little over one and [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1191.6399999999999s)]
*  We me and my wife drove in to New York City and we drove through Times Square just to go see like what the hell [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1195.08s)]
*  empty Times Square looks like and [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1203.0s)]
*  I mean it was like out of um, it was the Will Smith move [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1205.12s)]
*  I am legend it was like that like seeing Times Square with not a soul and like there were like a couple cops [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1208.56s)]
*  randomly, but no one's there so bizarre and then I remember we go up to my mother's house and we're walking down the street we [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1214.28s)]
*  Like parked the car and we're walking down the street in Manhattan and just hearing birds chirp [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1221.82s)]
*  In Manhattan was just so freaking bizarre, dude. There's no one on the streets the avenues [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1228.08s)]
*  I mean you look down Broadway. It's empty [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1234.28s)]
*  So this is going on in the world like this crazy time and then Facebook is doing this shit where if you remember Rob [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1235.82s)]
*  They started they made it that I had to or you one of the moderators from the group had to manually [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1241.94s)]
*  Post every single post like we had to approve it before it would be put in the group [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1248.42s)]
*  So we're really like kind of trying to get you on the hook [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1253.26s)]
*  Like you approved this post with and like you said they're shutting down while this is all happening [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1255.38s)]
*  We're like not allowed to talk about it to question it [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1262.1000000000001s)]
*  So like and then of course as you rightly pointed out doing turned out to be right about all of this stuff [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1265.6200000000001s)]
*  And it was all completely unnecessary and based on pseudoscience [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1270.8s)]
*  plus [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1274.36s)]
*  intense corruption and so yeah, it it is hard to just forget about all of that and I will say that with all of this [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1275.48s)]
*  Stuff it you know, by the way on top of that then at the end of 2020 [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1283.76s)]
*  He straight-up interfered in the US presidential election and like by at the government's behest [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1288.4s)]
*  By his own admission. I mean pretty much by his own admission [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1295.16s)]
*  Natalie see if you could pull up you could probably find it on YouTube if you could find actually because that maybe is the best [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1298.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was uh, if you just put Zuckerberg [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1303.8s)]
*  Rogan [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1307.12s)]
*  Hunter Biden so it should probably come up [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1308.8799999999999s)]
*  The point I'm making is that yeah, he stinks. He always stunk and he's a weak dude, but look at how much the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1312.48s)]
*  We've cleansed out. Yeah. Yeah some of the horrors of government that now this week bait a bitch of a guy [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1319.68s)]

*  No, I'm trying to take I'm trying to take the win. I'm struggling with with this one though [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1334.36s)]
*  You know, well it look I mean I guess to me it just it feels a little bit and when we play his video [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1339.6799999999998s)]
*  I think this will become more clear. It just feels to me a little bit like [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1343.98s)]
*  You know like if you were a [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1350.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's say like you felt you had a buddy and you found out that like his his wife was having an affair [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1352.96s)]
*  Or something like that, right? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1358.92s)]
*  It's like his wife had totally betrayed him was having an affair and you talked to your buddy and you were like Jesus man [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1360.0800000000002s)]
*  Sorry, you're going through that and he goes well that it's over and and we're we're working it out. You're like, okay [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1365.9s)]
*  so like [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1372.3200000000002s)]
*  She must like really apologize to you or something like that. You're like no. No, she never really apologized [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1373.68s)]
*  You know, she's just but she said she's not doing that anymore [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1378.96s)]
*  You're like, okay [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1382.8s)]
*  But like she acknowledged like how much that hurt you how fucked up it was that she was lying to you for all these years [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1384.04s)]
*  Like no, she just kind of said going forward [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1388.92s)]
*  You know with this new now we're in a new time where I think we can go forward without cheating and you know what? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1392.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm saying like then she kind of be like look dude, you could get back together with her [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1398.28s)]
*  You could leave her [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1401.54s)]
*  I'm not telling you what the right move is but like if you're getting back together with her that has to come with a fucking [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1402.04s)]
*  Apology that has to come with some acknowledgement of like what you did to your fellow Americans [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1406.72s)]
*  I mean look all these motherfuckers dude and I get it. I get what happened. I'm very well aware of it [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1412.4s)]
*  I've talked about it for many years. I know what happened Donald Trump used social media to win the White House in 2016 [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1417.8400000000001s)]
*  That was not the plan Hillary Clinton was supposed to win. Okay, and then he used this new technology [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1425.0400000000002s)]
*  He tweeted his way to the White House and so then the the fucking government decided we got a crackdown on that [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1431.02s)]
*  We got a crackdown on all this shit and they you know [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1437.2800000000002s)]
*  Essentially mafia tacticked the big tech companies into doing that and by the way in [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1440.8000000000002s)]
*  In plain sight like in front of everyone they hauled them in front of Congress and threatened the shit out of them on national television [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1447.2s)]
*  You know and so okay, I get it. I get that you were just but at the same time [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1454.0400000000002s)]
*  It's like all these guys who started these companies [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1457.76s)]
*  You know if you listen to like Zuckerberg or like Jack Dorsey or all these like big tech guys [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1460.4s)]
*  They always started with these like these lofty ambitions and like we're gonna connect the world and we're gonna change the future [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1467.8s)]
*  And we're gonna give regular people a voice and we're gonna allow people to communicate with each other [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1474.76s)]
*  And then it's like yeah, but like when it mattered the most [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1479.7s)]
*  Look what you did to your fellow Americans [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1483.72s)]
*  You know like you shut them down when they needed their voice the most and like dude [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  I and this is part of like why I disclosed that at the beginning why it's kind of personal to me in a way [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1491.34s)]
*  But look I can't tell you I got a lot [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1495.92s)]
*  I'm sure you get comments about this this too, but I got a lot man. I [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1497.96s)]
*  Still almost every show I do almost every time I'm like in front of a group of fans [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1503.72s)]
*  I get people who tell me that like dude you kept me sane through kovat [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1509.0800000000002s)]
*  Like the the podcast I did with malice our show people are always like dude. It was the craziest time [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1514.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, I couldn't have a funeral for my dad. I lost my job [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1519.5200000000002s)]
*  I went through all this shit [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1521.96s)]
*  But listening to this show man really and like that Facebook much more so than it was for me [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1523.48s)]
*  For a lot of people it was that thing like even just like taking that away from people. It's like man. There's something [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1528.6s)]
*  There's something so fucked up about removing people's voice from them, you know, like I'm not allowed to think [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1537.76s)]
*  I'm not allowed to communicate with other people like for the crime of being right about important stuff. Anyway, yeah [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1544.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's hear let's let's go to the the Rogan click because this was such a fact one of literally the most [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1551.8s)]
*  Fascinating moments in the history of the Joe Rogan experience and I've been on there a lot [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1556.32s)]
*  So it's really saying something here it is [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1560.52s)]
*  You guys handle things when they're a big news item that's controversial [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1563.24s)]
*  Like there was a lot of attention on Twitter during the election because of the hunter Biden laptop story [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1569.2s)]
*  The New York Post too. Yeah, so you guys censored that as well [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1576.28s)]
*  So we took a different path than Twitter [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1580.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean basically the background here is the FBI I think basically came to us some folks on our team. It was like, hey [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1582.54s)]
*  Just so you know, like you should be on high alert [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1590.8999999999999s)]
*  There was the we we thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1593.06s)]
*  We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump of [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1598.2199999999998s)]
*  Of [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1604.1s)]
*  That's similar to that so just be vigilant [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1606.3s)]
*  So our protocol is different from Twitter's what Twitter did is they said you can't share this at all [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1608.82s)]
*  We didn't do that. What we do is we have [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1614.98s)]
*  If something is reported to us as potentially [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1618.6599999999999s)]
*  Misinformation important misinformation we we also this third party fact-checking program because we don't want to be deciding what's true and false and [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1622.74s)]
*  For the I think it was five or seven days when it was basically being [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1629.98s)]
*  Being determined whether it was false [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1636.26s)]
*  The distribution on Facebook was decreased but people were still allowed to share it so you could still share it you could still consume it [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1640.78s)]
*  I'm say the distribution is decreased. It got shared. How does that work? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1647.6200000000001s)]
*  It basically the ranking and newsfeed was a little bit less so fewer people saw it than would have otherwise [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1651.8600000000001s)]
*  So it definitely by what percentage I don't know off the top my head, but it's it's it's meaningful [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1657.3799999999999s)]
*  But I mean, okay [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1663.46s)]
*  Let's stop it there. It's good. So I mean look just to be clear [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1665.3s)]
*  This is such a like he says it in a very nonchalant way that you could almost like hear that and not realize [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1669.04s)]
*  What a bombshell of a moment that was but this was the first time that it was confirmed that oh [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1675.94s)]
*  The FBI straight-up interfered in the 2020 election [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1683.46s)]
*  so, you know like for for whatever problem this is part of the thing where like um, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1687.72s)]
*  You know cuz people it's always like, you know, you get you choose what you're outraged by. It's like the freaking arguments [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1693.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm having with gnome on Twitter about well, you're not condemning anti-semitism enough or whatever, but you know people would [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1699.22s)]
*  It's very easy [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1706.26s)]

*  The FBI came and told us that a big Russian dump was coming [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1741.5s)]
*  And so now he doesn't exactly say that the FBI said when the hunter Biden laptop came out [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1746.4599999999998s)]

*  there's this big Russian dump that's coming and then the hunter Biden story comes out and then [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1760.58s)]
*  51 intelligence officers all signed their name to a letter saying this was Russian misinformation [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1766.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, what are you left to conclude other than? Oh, yeah, that's what they were talking about. No, and and so you could say [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1772.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay, it's not exactly the same thing as if the FBI had come after the story and said hey [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1780.3600000000001s)]
*  This is Russian disinformation, but it's a distinction without a difference kind of like [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1785.0800000000002s)]
*  Whether you ban a story or just make it so that nobody can see the story and what a ridiculous like there's [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1790.48s)]
*  listen, man, that is just such bullshit this whole like [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1798.08s)]

*  So it's like oh so what you won't kick me off the platform, but you'll make it so that nobody can see what I'm saying [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1807.72s)]
*  There yeah, that's the same thing as kicking someone off a platform and as I love when Rogan asked him by what percentage? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1813.08s)]
*  Meaningful. Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, it was pretty meaningful wasn't it? But so what does that mean? It was meaningful [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1819.76s)]
*  That means there was a bombshell October surprise that implicated a presidential candidate [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1825.12s)]
*  You know look make what you will of the story [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1832.6s)]
*  But the son of the president was getting fucking paid off by foreign governments and foreign companies that were in bed with foreign governments [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1835.68s)]
*  That's a scandal, you know [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1843.84s)]
*  And that's news and you fuck it you by your own admission here like [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1845.82s)]
*  Interfered in in the domestic politics of a presidential election. I don't know. That's a big fucking deal [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1851.5s)]
*  That's amazing that like that moment on Rogan should didn't trigger more than just people like me and you talking about it on a podcast [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1858.58s)]
*  But anyway, so that's the background of all of this [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1866.1s)]
*  cut to [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1869.94s)]

*  Hey everyone [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1880.78s)]
*  I want to talk about something important today because it's time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1881.5800000000002s)]
*  I [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1888.26s)]
*  Started building social media to give people a voice. I gave a speech at Georgetown five years ago [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1889.5s)]
*  I put in some protecting free expression, you know what this is [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1894.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you remember when Dalmos did that campaign and the CEO came out and said? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1898.06s)]
*  We know our pizza sucks. I know our pizza. Yes, that's what this is. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1902.42s)]
*  That's a great comparison or they were like, okay listen [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1908.26s)]
*  We have built up a reputation for just having garbage pizza [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1911.7s)]
*  So maybe we're gonna make it not garbage by the way, I don't think it got any better [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1916.22s)]
*  But I don't know. I don't really actually remember reading Domino's after that, but that's a very good comparison [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1920.14s)]
*  Yeah, that is essentially what we're looking at. I just I guess it's like I [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1924.5s)]
*  Can I break his nose back in place? I would [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1928.3400000000001s)]
*  Look, I would get an extra to hook. It's just amongst all the things about him that annoy me. Well, look I [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1932.26s)]
*  Would feel like not only comfortable but I like I'd be enthusiastic if he came out and said something like [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1939.8600000000001s)]
*  Which I understand look I know I get that [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1949.1000000000001s)]
*  I just round and tell the truth and that's not everybody can be that way and when you're in charge of a multi-billion dollar [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1951.3400000000001s)]
*  Company, maybe that's not possible. But like if he had come out and just been like, you know, I started [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1956.74s)]
*  I started this company to give people a voice [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1962.3400000000001s)]
*  Like that, you know, it's like I know that's just like a slogan, but what is this a fucking really? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1964.9s)]
*  It's a powerful thing to say it's like very profound in a lot of ways to give somebody a voice [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1968.9s)]
*  He goes and then I totally betrayed that [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1975.22s)]
*  That vision and I did it because you know, I was shaken down and I was worried about what would happen to me and all this [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1978.38s)]
*  But you know what? I'm never gonna do that again. We're a free speech platform [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1985.18s)]
*  I just be like, you know three cheers for the robot. He got it, right and he's on our side, you know fine [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1988.2s)]
*  But there isn't that [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1994.6s)]
*  That element to it. It's just like I did this so people could have a voice and yada yada yada some things happened [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=1996.68s)]
*  And I'm gonna give you a voice again. I don't know just makes me a little suspicious [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2002.44s)]
*  Name names. Yeah, really? Yeah, like Twitter files name name exactly, dude [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2008.2s)]
*  That's what we should be like a commitment like that would be something amazing if he was like listen [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2013.92s)]
*  We're gonna tell you all that you know, I said the FBI came and spoke to me about this [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2019.46s)]
*  Well, I'm gonna tell you exactly what FBI agents came and exactly what was said and all this shit. Yes, that would be fascinating [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2022.64s)]
*  Let's really open up Facebook's books and see how much government intervention there was in this [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2028.64s)]
*  We learned a lot of interesting stuff from from Elon Musk doing that that that would be something that actually like is a demonstration [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2035.3000000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean that you're really, you know have had a change of heart or something anyway, let's keep let's keep playing [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2042.4399999999998s)]
*  And I still believe this today [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2049.64s)]
*  But a lot has happened over the last several years. There's been widespread debate about potential harms from online content [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2051.7999999999997s)]
*  Governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more a lot of this is clearly political [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2058.96s)]
*  But there's also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there drugs terrorism child exploitation [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2064.6s)]
*  These are things that we take very seriously and I want to make sure that we handle responsibly [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2070.3999999999996s)]
*  So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2074.9199999999996s)]
*  But the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2078.6s)]
*  Even if they accidentally censor just 1% of posts, that's millions of people. Alright, so let's pause it again [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2082.04s)]
*  It's just so like you know what I mean? It's like it's dishonest bullshit. It's like listen, dude [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2089.0s)]
*  First of all, it's a hundred percent political. That's all any of this is [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2095.4399999999996s)]
*  This is not fucking pretend for a second that there's any real concern about Russian interference in our elections [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2100.2799999999997s)]
*  It's all nonsense. It's like complete bullshit. There's still to this day is [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2107.3599999999997s)]
*  zero evidence zero evidence that the DNC or the podesta [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2113.4399999999996s)]
*  Emails were hacked by Russia [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2119.2799999999997s)]
*  It's just was just a nonsense fucking talking point to cover from the embarrassing shit that was in those emails [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2121.6s)]
*  And so that they could make the story like oh [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2129.24s)]
*  Russian interference in the American elections [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2133.08s)]
*  And so you really better not even pay attention to what's on those emails because you know [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2135.56s)]
*  That's just basically doing Vladimir Putin's bidding and what was on those emails [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2138.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, it was that the DNC cheated Bernie Sanders out of the 2016 primary [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2142.4399999999996s)]
*  They're supposed to be a neutral body and they were straight-up working for Hillary Clinton [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2148.04s)]
*  Including having Donna Brazil feed Hillary Clinton the questions that were to be asked at a town hall in advance [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2151.68s)]
*  We have that straight up [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2159.08s)]
*  We have the email of Donna Brazil sending her the fucking questions and then two weeks later those questions being asked at the town hall [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2160.68s)]
*  There's also a whole bunch of language that I guess is code for pedophilia stuff [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2168.12s)]
*  Which whatever nobody's allowed to look into and obviously you're a kook if you ever bring that up [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2172.64s)]
*  Even though multiple pedophile rings have been busted since then that implicate a lot of the same people who are on those emails [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2177.16s)]
*  and [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2184.8799999999997s)]
*  And you know a whole bunch of other [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2185.9199999999996s)]
*  Shit like that. That's what they didn't want you to say anyway, so it's all political [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2188.2000000000003s)]
*  But don't give me this shit about like oh the problem was just that there's like terrorism and child trafficking [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2192.92s)]
*  And that that's why we had to that's why we had to remove your fucking Facebook group about how fucking ventilators were killing people [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2198.08s)]
*  Right. That's why that's why we had to censor the fucking Great Barrington declaration [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2204.92s)]
*  Because we're worried about terrorism and give me a fucking break dude. So it's like I don't know. I know it's a win [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2210.6s)]
*  It's good. I hope they censor less going forward, but this is just such bullshit, and I don't know it pisses me off [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2216.64s)]

*  All right, let's keep playing [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2327.12s)]
*  Point where it's just too many mistakes in too much censorship [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2330.8399999999997s)]
*  The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2334.92s)]
*  So we're gonna get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2340.6s)]
*  Simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms more specifically. Here's what we're gonna do [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2344.7999999999997s)]
*  First we're gonna get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2352.3799999999997s)]
*  after Trump first got elected in 2016 [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2359.8599999999997s)]
*  It's also just hilarious how much of a bitch he is because he's like [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2362.9399999999996s)]
*  Since the media landscape has changed in the US and we can get away with it [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2366.5s)]
*  We'll do it here [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2370.0s)]
*  But in Europe where I still have to contend with the government that doesn't want you to have freedom [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2370.74s)]
*  You guys are on your own because I have no balls, right? Right? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2374.9399999999996s)]
*  But also it's just like like my example of like your buddy's wife is cheating on him and then it's like, you know [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2378.9s)]
*  she's like well, you know, I recognize that the landscape has changed and [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2386.3s)]
*  You know [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2390.66s)]
*  Being faithful to your spouse is now more important. It's like no you got caught. That's what happened [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2391.94s)]
*  You know, what do you talk? You mean you lost? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2398.58s)]
*  That's the so you lost so now I'm for freedom of speech again. Like what the landscape chair? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2401.1s)]
*  I mean, yes, okay [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2407.58s)]
*  I get that but so is the implication there that like if Donald Trump hadn't have won the election that [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2408.62s)]
*  Then we'd still do censorship. I don't know it just and and your point about the European countries exactly, right? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2417.34s)]
*  It's like oh, so you're just [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2423.62s)]
*  Still kind of going with whatever is acceptable [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2425.82s)]
*  Like I don't know I don't know how you're supposed to feel about people who were like [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2429.7s)]
*  again [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2434.66s)]
*  You know, it's something I've struggled with myself because it's like, you know during the whole Cove it thing in general [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2435.86s)]
*  Which is obviously very related to the where it was the the biggest censorship year was 2020 [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2441.7400000000002s)]
*  But because it was coven and it was a presidential election year, but I remember, you know like [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2448.1400000000003s)]
*  at the height of Cove it and [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2453.1400000000003s)]
*  When there were examples of countries that were even you know, a couple clicks more authoritarian than than we were [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2455.86s)]
*  And I'm not talking about like China obviously [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2463.12s)]
*  I think the expectation is that China is gonna be many clicks more authoritarian than we are in all things [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2465.2s)]
*  But I'm talking about like Australia [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2470.04s)]
*  where the you know the crazy shit they were doing out there and [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2472.56s)]
*  You'd sit there and you we would talk about this often where we'd be like hey right now [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2475.96s)]
*  If someone like at the height of the vaccine propaganda if someone were to come out right now and say hey [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2480.08s)]
*  We're placing all [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2486.32s)]
*  Unvaccinated Americans on house arrest they're not allowed to leave their homes like what percentage of the people would support that and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2488.92s)]
*  It wasn't zero, you know what I mean, and you're like it wasn't I mean, I don't know, you know, obviously we don't know [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2496.6800000000003s)]
*  We don't haven't conducted a scientific poll on this but whatever percentage it was it was a law there was like [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2503.1600000000003s)]
*  At least like say 30% of the population at one point what I think would have supported that obviously [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2510.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm just kind of guesstimating the numbers, but then you'd go like alright [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2516.66s)]
*  Forget house arrest [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2521.8199999999997s)]
*  Camps [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2524.7s)]
*  We're rounding them all up and throwing them in camps. I mean, I think the percentage would drop wouldn't drop to zero [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2525.74s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2531.2599999999998s)]
*  like there were there was a percentage of people in this country who would basically have just supported any of it and [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2532.22s)]
*  That is a very difficult thing to like deal with [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2539.22s)]
*  After the things over even when they come back and you're like, yeah, but like it's the guy yelling Jews in the attic [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2542.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like yeah, but I know who you are, you know, and at the same time you're like we have to move on somehow [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2548.3599999999997s)]
*  I can't just like hate every fucking liberal person's guts in America. I'm not that's not who I want to be but [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2552.66s)]
*  It is tough. It is a touch [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2560.8199999999997s)]
*  So like I'm not exactly sure what the right answer with any of this shit is [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2562.8999999999996s)]
*  But I do just feel like a thing with him where it's like that dude [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2566.18s)]
*  You did something really wrong and I understand listen man, I understand being George Soros, right rounded up Jews for the Nazis [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2569.2599999999998s)]
*  Do you blame obviously source was a little kid when this happened? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2578.3399999999997s)]
*  But like do you blame his father for doing that? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2581.22s)]
*  Yeah kind of and then also you kind of understand you're in an impossible situation and you're trying to survive yourself [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2583.22s)]
*  But there is something you did something horrible and like okay, you did it under duress, you know [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2590.1s)]
*  I'll grant you that but there's still something that you did that was really horrible and there's no [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2595.46s)]
*  Reckoning with that at all. It's just we're doing this going forward here. Let's let's keep playing [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2602.56s)]
*  The legacy media wrote non-stop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2609.7000000000003s)]
*  We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of you didn't [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2615.02s)]
*  The fact [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2620.1s)]
*  Politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created especially in the US [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2622.7799999999997s)]
*  So over the next couple of months, we're gonna phase in a more comprehensive community notes system [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2627.8199999999997s)]
*  Second we're gonna simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2634.1s)]
*  That are just out of touch with mainstream discourse [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2640.8199999999997s)]
*  What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2644.2999999999997s)]
*  Shut out people with different ideas and it's gone too far in other words [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2650.14s)]
*  We couldn't bring I want to make sure your kids it's it's it really is just like oh this whole thing fucking backfired [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2653.58s)]
*  There's been a big [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2660.14s)]
*  cultural like pendulum swing back and [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2662.54s)]
*  No, no [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2665.58s)]
*  Now we're gonna get on board with what's popular just like we did when all this insane shit was popular turns out if the internet has [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2666.38s)]
*  Free speech now that that must guy ruined all our plans and bought X [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2672.8199999999997s)]
*  We can't brainwash you all into thinking that everyone thinks it's normal to have your kids [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2676.2599999999998s)]
*  Transgender and so we can't do this thing where we bully you and call you crazy [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2681.06s)]
*  And so gee shucks. It looks like we got to change what we were doing. Well, you know, there's um [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2685.54s)]
*  And I guess I get this from reading Mises [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2692.14s)]
*  Who really everybody should read it's just such a beautiful thinker, but you know, he would talk about like [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2696.2999999999997s)]
*  Like demonstrated preference [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2703.72s)]
*  You know where like if you you know, if you go if you buy a hat for ten dollars [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2706.3599999999997s)]
*  Okay, then it's saying I need a hat. We're trying to sing I'm saying I will give you the ten dollars [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2712.72s)]
*  Just buy that [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2718.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, you're good. You're good. Let's say you get sunglasses [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2719.3999999999996s)]
*  We'll make it a more neutral [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2723.08s)]
*  But you know, so if you like and and there's like a voluntary [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2724.7999999999997s)]
*  There's no guns being held to anyone's head here like you go into a store and you buy a pair of sunglasses for 20 bucks [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2728.48s)]
*  Or whatever like we could deduce from that that you value the sunglasses [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2733.0s)]
*  More than you value the $20 and we could deduce from that that the person who owns the store [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2737.76s)]
*  Values the $20 more than they value the sunglasses because otherwise you wouldn't make that trade, you know [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2743.4s)]
*  So like you could sit [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2748.2400000000002s)]
*  Outside of the store and say I really want those sunglasses [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2750.2400000000002s)]
*  I really like them more than the $20 in my wallet [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2753.8s)]
*  But if you actually go and buy it then that's kind of more concrete [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2757.52s)]
*  Conclusion, you know this is always like been a very simple insight that I think you know colors a lot of my thinking [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2761.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like I I know you've heard me [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2769.3199999999997s)]
*  Talk about this before Rob, but like it's when liberals [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2772.8399999999997s)]
*  Will argue that Social Security is incredibly popular [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2776.64s)]
*  No, Social Security is one of the most popular programs that we have you'd get rid of Social Security [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2781.04s)]
*  But 82% of people say they like Social Security or whatever and I always be like, yeah, but what does that even mean? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2785.72s)]
*  Does it mean it's popular? But you asked people you had an opinion poll and they said it's popular. It's like, okay, it's forced [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2792.0s)]
*  You have to pay into Social Security at the threat of violence. So like [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2801.0s)]
*  How about just make it voluntary then we'll find out real quick how popular this program is, right? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2806.3599999999997s)]
*  Let's just say that okay, so if you could snap your fingers and tomorrow there's no more Social Security tax [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2813.2000000000003s)]
*  You can choose to opt in or opt out [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2818.28s)]
*  Then we'll really find out how popular it is, right because it's easy to say it's popular [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2821.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like but it's like if I put a gun to your head and go we're going over to the movie theater and we're watching [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2825.84s)]
*  This movie and then I start trying to tell everybody Rob really wants to see this movie [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2830.52s)]
*  He really wants to go to this movie [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2834.84s)]
*  You'd be like, yeah, but then why do you need the gun to the head dude? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2836.48s)]
*  Like if he really wants to see this how about put the gun down and then we'll find out what's up [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2838.72s)]
*  Likewise as I listen to Zuckerberg here, it's like oh the cultures changed and now [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2844.2s)]
*  People don't view you know, they view these things as oppressive now or they view these things as something that's type you were [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2851.12s)]
*  Silencing people so don't tell me that anything change people were already against this shit [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2857.7s)]
*  The only thing that changed is that now they're allowed to say it [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2862.7599999999998s)]
*  Right like the very fact that you had to censor people about this topic [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2866.06s)]
*  Proves that everyone wasn't on board with this topic. It's like yeah you [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2871.1400000000003s)]

*  There's to go like the same way when we look back at like the commies or the Nazis or like any of these like other [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2894.42s)]
*  And we go. Holy shit. Everyone just lost their fucking minds the entire society lost their fucking minds [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2900.5800000000004s)]
*  How the fuck do you get to this place where you're doing this shit? Well, it's like the same thing, dude [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2907.02s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying like the crimes the underlying crimes are exactly the same [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2912.3s)]
*  But the fact that we were even like [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2915.82s)]
*  having a [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2918.26s)]

*  There's chromosomes [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2934.82s)]

*  But like it's still there whether you agree with it or not this was like [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2942.14s)]
*  Something that had to be shut down [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2946.7799999999997s)]
*  It's just pure madness and you played a leading role in that madness [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2948.06s)]

*  So that was nuts what happened back there guys, right? Yeah, I think you know these things started with good intentions [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2957.8599999999997s)]
*  But they ended up being misused. It's like I I'm sorry [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2964.42s)]

*  There's just there's no way you're gonna convince me that the censorship of [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2969.7799999999997s)]

*  Noble intention to crack down on misinformation [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2984.94s)]
*  It's absolute bullshit and you know if that were the case you would have seen a correction much much quicker [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2989.02s)]
*  You know like what like for example say [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2995.18s)]
*  The correction wouldn't have come after [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=2998.52s)]
*  Just to pick one example, right and let's go with the hunter Biden laptop because that's the the biggest one and the one that [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3003.88s)]
*  We just played the clip of the correction wouldn't have come years later [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3008.7200000000003s)]
*  When Elon Musk bought Twitter says he's gonna make it a free speech platform [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3013.1600000000003s)]

*  Donald Trump ends up winning a dominant victory and then we have this correction the correction would have come as soon as we realized [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3019.7200000000003s)]
*  That that was not Russian disinformation and that that was really hunter Biden's laptop, which was by the way on this show [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3026.2s)]
*  We realized it that week [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3033.04s)]
*  It was very easy to figure out [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3035.3599999999997s)]
*  It was very very easy to figure out that that was in fact hunter Biden's laptop and the New York Times even admitted it [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3037.3599999999997s)]
*  They took them another year and a half, but they admitted it ultimately. They're usually about a year and a half behind the show [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3043.08s)]
*  That's the truth. Sorry Sam Harris. That's just the way it it happens to be but like you would think okay [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3049.2s)]
*  Then the correction would come immediately. Yeah, right. Like I mean if you were like if you were giving [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3054.66s)]
*  Your kid the wrong medicine and then they started getting sicker [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3061.18s)]
*  Well, they start getting sicker you'd stop giving them the medicine and like right you wouldn't like do it for years and years [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3065.8999999999996s)]
*  Until your kid finally grew up and was like hey this medicine is making me sick [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3071.7s)]
*  You know what? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3075.18s)]
*  I mean, you've kept me sick my entire childhood and then you go, you know [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3075.74s)]
*  There's been a cultural change ever since you grew up and realized I was poisoning you and in this new environment [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3078.92s)]
*  While I always cared about your health in this new environment. I'm gonna stop poisoning you and that would be bullshit [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3084.66s)]
*  It's giving me major Cuomo vibes. Yeah. I uh, yeah, that's right. Exactly right. All right, let's keep playing [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3090.3799999999997s)]
*  The people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3097.7799999999997s)]
*  Third we're changing how we enforce our policies to reduce the mistakes that account for the vast majority of censorship on our platforms [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3102.2599999999998s)]
*  We used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3111.1s)]
*  Now we're gonna focus those filters on tackling illegal and high severity violations and for lower severity violations [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3114.8999999999996s)]
*  We're going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3122.02s)]
*  The problem is that the filters make mistakes and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn't so by dialing them back [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3126.46s)]
*  We're gonna dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3132.54s)]
*  You know what I hate the most about this is that this just speaks to taking things down [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3136.3399999999997s)]
*  It doesn't speak to shadow banning at all. Mm-hmm [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3140.42s)]
*  Which is a whole nother universe of to what extent is your content not being shown to people not being favored in the algorithms [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3143.46s)]
*  You know, I'm even noticing this on Twitter [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3150.94s)]
*  I don't know if you've been noticing this but I find I spend very little time scrolling now [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3152.78s)]
*  I spend more time using the Gronk and the other features [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3156.78s)]
*  But I find that in my scroll I get what used to be like chain mail type [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3160.1000000000004s)]
*  features or like what the old like a well top 10 articles would be where it'd be like [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3164.86s)]
*  Look at this new gap and like it's a thread and it seems to be all algorithm based engagement of them [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3168.96s)]
*  Sure accounts that are now monetize [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3176.56s)]
*  That are like figured out the algorithm of how to get this shit in front of me and it's stuff that I've never followed [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3178.7200000000003s)]
*  I have no interest in whatsoever [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3183.2400000000002s)]
*  Anyways, what the point I'm trying to make is there's a universe of just the algorithm and what it serves to people [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3185.44s)]
*  Which doesn't even speak to this more harsh thing of his nonsense about what gets pulled down or oh now we're gonna do it [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3190.88s)]
*  So wait a second [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3198.36s)]
*  You guys didn't have enough computing software to go after just the child defense people and so you decided to take away from that computing [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3199.1200000000003s)]
*  Software, right? I don't know almost sounds criminal [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3205.98s)]
*  Yeah, really sure tell me you could have taken down more child pedophiles [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3209.76s)]
*  But you guys just chose not to instead you chose to just silence your fellow Americans who were speaking up about whatever it might be [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3213.1600000000003s)]
*  And even things that are like, you know [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3220.0s)]
*  Because obviously also during kovat and this is really at the heart of all of it [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3222.36s)]
*  Right and it's kind of at the heart of the whole free speech question [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3227.4s)]
*  Is that look there were because I don't want to like [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3230.48s)]
*  Oversimplify things there weren't people who got it wrong who were you know skeptics there were people who had wild conspiracy [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3234.1600000000003s)]
*  There was always dumb shit out there. I mean, I remember the one was the thing about [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3241.7200000000003s)]
*  There's like one video that people actually fell for it was so obviously fake but um [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3246.1600000000003s)]
*  It was like they were saying that the vaccine like made you magnetic [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3251.84s)]
*  There's something like that and so it was like look I just got the vaccine and now this spoon is sticking to me or something [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3256.1600000000003s)]
*  Like that you were like, yeah, dude [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3261.52s)]
*  Why like what and I swear to God I I mean I'm not saying this is the case [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3262.86s)]
*  But I always kind of like in my mind I'm like I bet this is an op [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3266.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what? I mean, like I bet this is this is total like controlled opposition like oh, let's fucking make the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3269.96s)]
*  Conspiracy there is look as bad as they possibly can, you know [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3276.92s)]
*  But so there was bullshit but this is why you need freedom [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3281.32s)]
*  But then there would also be the truth out there that you could and you have to figure out how to sift through that [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3284.96s)]
*  And have you know sources you can trust and good information verse bad [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3289.12s)]
*  But there were also people who got it completely right on the internet and they got silenced with all the rest of them [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3293.64s)]
*  And so yeah, look to your point [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3299.1600000000003s)]
*  it's [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3302.28s)]
*  It's like look just stop interfering with what people fucking say. That's it [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3304.32s)]
*  Just let it be organic let people fucking speak and that's that and and look as I said [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3309.08s)]
*  You weren't on that episode [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3315.6800000000003s)]
*  But as I said the other day when I was talking about a bunch of these [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3317.2000000000003s)]
*  Accounts on Twitter who got like their blue check taken away and got demonetized [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3320.0s)]
*  It's like look I'm not saying that any social media platform has to be [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3323.8s)]
*  100% the wild wild west there could be things that you're like you're not allowed to say on this platform [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3330.44s)]
*  It's like if you want to say you can't say the n-word or you can't say, you know, whatever [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3335.88s)]
*  Okay, like I don't really think too many people are gonna go to war over that but just make the rule [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3342.76s)]
*  Clear and then apply it equally. You know what I mean? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3348.5600000000004s)]
*  Like just make the rule clear make a reasonable rule [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3351.92s)]
*  Make it clear what the rules are and then apply them across the board and I think you're gonna solve all of these problems [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3355.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying I'm like far from a computer genius who understands like how to actually run Facebook, but I [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3361.64s)]
*  It is obvious enough that it's just like look you kind of almost admitted it yourself [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3369.68s)]
*  Rather than being what you know, you started Facebook to give everybody a voice what you ended up becoming was a [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3376.3199999999997s)]
*  tool of the regime to silence dissent [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3383.96s)]
*  Okay, that is the opposite of giving everybody a voice that is there's no movie where you watch [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3387.68s)]
*  That you're not the bad guy for that [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3394.44s)]
*  That's the bad guy, you know if I was just telling you about a plot for a movie and I went okay [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3397.72s)]
*  Well, there's this one guy who works for the regime to censor all of the critics of the regime [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3402.22s)]
*  There's no movie where that guy's the good guy. That guy's the bad guy. There's no scenario [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3407.54s)]
*  I couldn't even write a story around that where you were like no, no, no, no [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3412.64s)]
*  But I'm telling you he's the good guy because you see the people are just so bad and the regime is just so noble [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3415.44s)]
*  They're like really the regime so noble. What are they in the business of war mostly war, you know war and some Ponzi schemes [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3419.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, they're the good guys [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3427.6400000000003s)]
*  Anyway, look, I mean here let's play. I think there's only a little bit left. So let's [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3430.36s)]
*  So going to tune our content filters to require much higher confidence before taking down content [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3435.6400000000003s)]
*  The reality is that this is a trade-off it means we're gonna catch less bad stuff [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3441.84s)]
*  But we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3446.84s)]
*  Fourth we're bringing back civic content for a while [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3453.0s)]
*  The community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed. So we stopped recommending these posts [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3457.02s)]
*  But it feels like we're in a new era now and we're starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3463.02s)]
*  So we're gonna start phasing this back into Facebook Instagram and threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3469.28s)]
*  Fifth we're gonna move our trust and safety and content moderation to get a pause for second out of California [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3476.84s)]
*  I almost got to just even process what that fucking horse shit was. I'm not even sure what he like [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3483.0s)]
*  So in other words political content was all shadow banned if it was divisive, which sounds like conservative [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3488.2200000000003s)]
*  But now he's realizing there's so many people who are conservatives that actually want to see things that reflect their opinion [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3494.64s)]
*  so whereas if you were looking for [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3500.56s)]
*  Information like ours you probably weren't gonna be finding it on Instagram or Facebook [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3503.2999999999997s)]
*  Right, and so now they're gonna allow more of it through as long as it's safe and positive, which means that there's still [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3506.72s)]
*  Moderation. Yeah, Elon Musk said a thing about that the other day too about positive [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3513.72s)]
*  God, I hated that. I hated that and I'm a fan of Elon Musk [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3518.44s)]
*  I'm not trying to beat up on him. I don't have you know any like I have some and he's also just playing the game [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3522.84s)]
*  Well, look, you might be right about that, but I'm just saying like I have contempt for Mark Zuckerberg and what he did [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3529.52s)]
*  I don't have that for Elon. I'd see him much more as kind of like a heroic figure [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3534.44s)]
*  But like even him saying the thing about like [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3539.7200000000003s)]
*  Positivity versus negativity. What are we children? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3542.76s)]
*  Again, it's like I like I already got little kids so I don't need to like I don't know [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3545.48s)]
*  No need to like what my tweets are supposed to be fluffy and sons like what the fuck what if I'm pissed off [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3550.68s)]
*  I'm not allowed to be pissed off. Isn't that part of like freedom also? I thought that was a lot [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3555.96s)]
*  I thought we were doing a free speech platform here, right? It's like what am I exactly spoke? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3560.68s)]
*  Like I don't know dude. I focus on all the things I'm pissed off about my posts aren't gonna be positive [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3565.56s)]
*  most of the time like if I if you know [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3570.88s)]
*  If you got me, you know [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3574.96s)]
*  If one of you guys came upstairs later [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3576.32s)]
*  And I was just screaming at my three-year-old about all the evil things in the world like then there might be there might be a moment [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3578.4s)]
*  You're like hey Dave lighten up a little bit, you know, like that's not being so negative [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3584.1200000000003s)]
*  Let's be a little more positive here. He just wants to play blocks, you know, okay, they are enough [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3588.0800000000004s)]
*  But when I come downstairs into our studio, it's time for me to rant and be angry [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3592.0s)]
*  That's what I'm here for [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3597.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm here to rant about all the shit that I think is wrong that I don't want it to be going on anymore [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3599.2400000000002s)]
*  So like I don't know I just hate all of this that's who's and and [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3604.2599999999998s)]
*  You know who's exactly to say that people want [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3608.74s)]
*  You know a positive experience [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3613.1s)]
*  Like what does that mean people like to argue on social media arguing is good arguing is healthy. It's that that's okay [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3615.86s)]
*  It's okay to get into debates about things and that's not when you get into a debate, especially like a meaningful one [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3621.74s)]
*  And this isn't I don't just mean like a political debate or anything like that [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3629.74s)]
*  It's like if you [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3634.14s)]
*  If you're in a relationship any relationship romantic friendship, whatever if you're in a relationship and there's something there's like a real problem [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3636.14s)]
*  Like a real problem that needs to be solved that needs to be hashed out. It's [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3644.3799999999997s)]
*  All but guaranteed someone's gonna get offended someone's gonna get upset someone's gonna have to go through that [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3649.8599999999997s)]
*  But that's part of life. It's a healthy part of life [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3656.7s)]
*  That's actually much better to go through that than to just avoid it and so like what does this mean we're supposed to just like [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3659.38s)]
*  avoid [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3665.7000000000003s)]
*  Negativity like with how goddamn corrupt this country is I'm supposed to be positive about that [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3668.7000000000003s)]
*  No, you will not take away my my right to be angry on social media [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3675.34s)]
*  I'll be doing more of it later today. All right, guys [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3681.26s)]
*  Let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show which is monetary metals an amazing company that has [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3684.24s)]
*  Revolutionized the precious metal space. I've been telling you guys about monetary metals for a long time there [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3690.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a great company run by great people and they really have done something [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3695.3199999999997s)]
*  Incredible it many people obviously for a long time people have owned precious metals [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3700.3999999999996s)]
*  Typically as a hedge against inflation also sometimes as an investment [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3705.98s)]
*  But now because of monetary metals you can not just own gold and silver [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3710.02s)]
*  But you can own gold and silver that yields interest in gold and silver [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3714.84s)]
*  So you're actually growing your total amount of ounces over time [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3720.56s)]
*  So truly you're opting out of the dollar system when you go with monetary metals, you know [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3724.58s)]
*  We maybe we can't end the Fed tomorrow, but monetary metals has come up with a real alternative [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3729.96s)]
*  Go check them out amazing company incredible opportunity [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3735.82s)]
*  monetary dash medals comm that's the website or you could just click the link in the episode description [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3739.6200000000003s)]
*  monetary dash medals comm alright, let's get back into the show [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3745.98s)]
*  All right. Let's play a little bit more of this and then we'll wrap it up [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3750.34s)]
*  Yeah, and our US based content review is gonna be based in Texas as we work to promote free expression [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3753.38s)]
*  I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3759.7000000000003s)]
*  of our teams [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3765.78s)]
*  Finally, we're gonna work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3767.46s)]
*  They're going after American companies and pushing to censor more [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3772.46s)]
*  The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3776.5400000000004s)]
*  Europe has an ever-increasing number of laws [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3781.5400000000004s)]
*  institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3784.78s)]
*  Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3789.1400000000003s)]
*  China has censored our apps from even working in the country [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3795.2200000000003s)]
*  The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3798.6200000000003s)]
*  And that's why it's been so difficult over the past four years [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3804.78s)]
*  When even the US government has pushed for censorship by going after us and other American companies [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3807.82s)]
*  It has emboldened other governments to go even further [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3813.78s)]
*  But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression and I am excited to take it [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3817.42s)]
*  It'll take time to get this right and these are complex systems. They're never gonna be perfect [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3823.42s)]
*  There's also a lot of illegal stuff that we still need to work very hard to remove [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3828.58s)]
*  But the bottom line is that after years of having our content moderation work focus primarily on removing content [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3833.2599999999998s)]
*  It is time to focus on reducing the stakes [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3840.22s)]
*  Simplifying our systems and getting back to our roots about giving people voice [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3843.66s)]
*  I'm looking forward to this next chapter. Stay good out there and more to come soon [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3848.18s)]
*  Stay good out there. All right. Well, let me I guess let me try to end this on a note of positivity [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3852.74s)]
*  Well, look [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3859.14s)]
*  It is a positive sign that he's making this video. You know what I mean? And so there is a win in here [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3860.42s)]
*  I'm not exactly accepting, you know like this from Zuckerberg himself [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3865.22s)]
*  But to the extent that he's gonna cut down on censoring people that is a good thing and look man it is [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3870.3399999999997s)]
*  And and don't get me wrong because I know we still have like so many goddamn problems and and we didn't even get to [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3877.8199999999997s)]
*  talk about some of the other stuff we had plan will save it for for tomorrow's show, but [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3884.62s)]
*  There's a lot of problems that are still left in this country. There's the the economic, you know [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3889.1s)]
*  The fiscal cliff and the monetary situation. There's the warfare state [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3893.94s)]
*  There's a lot of big problems left in this country. But man, I will say on a note of positivity see this could be on Facebook [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3897.54s)]
*  After the last you know, let's say the last eight years of dealing with so much of this insanity [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3904.46s)]
*  It is nice to at least have the feeling of like yeah [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3911.94s)]
*  The culture has kind of shifted and is snapping back in in a different direction [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3916.62s)]
*  So at least thank God for that. All right, listen, we do got to wrap up [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJiRpgNNepo&t=3922.02s)]
