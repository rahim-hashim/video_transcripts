# Dave Smith | Tim Dillon Embarrasses CNN | Part Of The Problem 1267
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Dave Smith. I am Roland Solo for this episode. I am about as soon as we're done [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  here I'm going to head over to the Soho Forum in New York City and meet Robbie the Fire [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=15.84s)]
*  Bernstein and doing my big immigration debate over there. So if you guys are listening to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  this there is a there will be a live stream of the debate tonight. I'm not sure you know [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=26.32s)]
*  in the past Gene puts them up on the line a few days afterwards. I'm not sure if it'll be up [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=34.56s)]
*  by the time you're listening to this if you want to go check it out. If you're listening live [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=39.84s)]
*  because you're a subscriber over at part of the problem.com first of all thank you very much for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=44.24s)]
*  subscribing and yeah it should be available to watch live later on today and then the the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=48.56s)]
*  debate will be up on on YouTube at some point not sure exactly when. I'll find out more of that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=56.0s)]
*  information and I'll post about it on Twitter. Anyway looking forward very much to doing that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=61.2s)]
*  I have not been to one of the Soho Forum debates. Man I don't remember the last one I went to. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=66.56s)]
*  I was unable to make that when Scott Horton debated Bill Kristol. I was unable to make that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  because it was I think it was like the day after my son was born or something like that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=80.08s)]
*  And you know I thought about telling my wife like hey honey you're on your own. I got to go [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=86.8s)]
*  catch a debate with Scott Horton. But you know in life there are competing values. There are you know [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=92.08s)]
*  watching a debate with Scott Horton maintaining your marriage. They're all I'm not saying one is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=97.2s)]
*  better than the other but I made I made the decision I made and I can't change the past. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=101.36s)]
*  I think the last time I went might have been the last time Gene Epstein was doing one of his [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=105.6s)]
*  socialist debates. I'm not sure. Anyway I'm really really looking forward to going back there [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=109.92s)]
*  because first of all I love Gene Epstein. I love his whole team and it's just always like a great [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=114.88s)]
*  group of people. So really really looking forward to seeing some of you guys out there tonight and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=121.28s)]
*  I'll be hanging out. I'll be at the after party afterward if any of you guys are coming out come [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=125.28s)]
*  say hi. Okay so for today's show I did think it would be necessary and good to respond to what was [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  really truly to me really an incredible spectacle. I'm talking about my friend my old friend Tim [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=141.6s)]
*  Dillon being interviewed by CNN which really in so many ways I just found this really interesting [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  obviously going into it. Like I'm pretty biased on this topic and you know I'm friends with Tim. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=156.48s)]
*  I've been friends with him for years. Many of the people involved who they're talking about are good [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=163.28s)]
*  friends of mine. I am also involved in this comedians talking about politics on podcasts [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=167.6s)]
*  broader world. And anyway I just I find all of this stuff to be very interesting and it's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  also I think very consequential for the state of our society. Now I don't know if any of you guys [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=181.92s)]
*  had this same reaction that I had but when I first like they by the way I should say to CNN's credit [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=190.0s)]
*  they put the whole thing out I believe unedited. And you know Tim had talked about this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=197.6s)]
*  about what was it um oh a little less than a month ago I guess he was on Rogan and he was talking [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  about how they wanted to put an edited version out and he was kind of like being like no no no [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=210.88s)]
*  put the whole version out. It does seem like perhaps that influenced their decision making. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=214.56s)]
*  Typically in the past this was very often the MO for big corporate news networks and also for the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=219.68s)]
*  the comedy shows like this was um this was something that like John Stewart relied on for many [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=232.8s)]
*  years and all the other shows that were kind of imitating the Daily Show where they would have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=238.64s)]
*  they'd have you come in sit for 45 minutes they'd end up airing three minutes of the interview [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=244.0s)]
*  and of course they'd pick the parts that tried to make you look as ridiculous as possible. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=251.27999999999997s)]
*  As I remember they were they were really really unfair about this in many ways but of course the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=258.08s)]
*  corporate media would do the exact same thing. They have you sit for a long interview take you [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=262.88s)]
*  know what I mean they they'd try to ask you a bunch of gotcha questions and then if there were [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=267.76s)]
*  any that you didn't give a really good answer to they'd just play that part and not that is [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=272.88s)]
*  something that you know it's it's very interesting because this this tactic which was obviously [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=279.12s)]
*  always a tactic but it was somewhat defensible in the old order because you'd be like well I [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=287.12s)]
*  don't know we only have so much air time we got commercials we only have the show is only an hour [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=293.36s)]
*  long this is only a 10 minute segment of the show there's two commercial breaks in it so all we [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  could play is like two three minute chunks from this interview these days of course there's really [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  just absolutely zero excuse why you can't put the whole thing unedited on your YouTube page [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  and in in this case with something like CNN and someone as big as Tim Dillon you put this on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=313.12s)]
*  YouTube you're going to get five times the viewership of your of it being on television [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=319.76s)]
*  so like there's literally no reason why you can't do that and so to their credit I guess they did it [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=325.52s)]
*  now I noticed immediately when a couple of the clips came out and I wonder if anyone else had [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=332.8s)]
*  this same experience but I went right away I was like this chick was interviewing Tim Dillon I was [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=337.52s)]
*  like where do I know her from I was like I know I know her from somewhere but where have I seen her [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=342.4s)]
*  before and then comes to find out it's she was the one who made like the big vice documentary [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=348.96s)]
*  about Charlottesville and she went and like interviewed like Christopher Cantwell and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  Richard Spencer and some of the guys who were involved in Charlottesville and it's just I just [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=363.76s)]
*  thought that was so funny because it's like I haven't seen anything of her since then and then [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  he or she like this is her beat it's like going and talking to the right wing extremists or however [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  they view it anyway the interview was a I found it fascinating it's mostly like it could almost [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=378.0s)]
*  be characterized as the like the CNN worldview just meeting a common sense answer and then being [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=390.4s)]
*  kind of dumbfounded at this common sense answer and Tim really you know one of the things that's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=400.24s)]
*  interesting about Tim is that he's not obviously Tim's like Tim's an incredibly talented comedian [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=405.92s)]
*  one of the funniest human beings on the planet he's just just an incredibly unique talent but [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  he's very sarcastic and over the top and kind of bombastic and he wasn't in this interview he sat [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=418.8s)]
*  down and just gave like a real honest interview and it was just very interesting to me to see that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=424.16s)]
*  this world you know of the corporate media meeting a very common sense response and kind of not [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=430.24s)]
*  knowing what to do with it anyway I thought for this show we would play a couple of the clips and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=436.72s)]
*  I would I would give some thoughts on it so let's let's start that now here is the the first clip [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  that I'm sure a lot of you have seen it's been going super viral all over the internet [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  but do you I ask because yeah do you feel like you're part of a new establishment [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=452.23999999999995s)]
*  that's being created I don't think I'm part of a new establishment I think it would be pretty [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  difficult to look at these podcasts I know it's a popular thing right now especially in certain [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  media circles to say that after running an incredibly unpopular candidate who is introduced [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=471.28s)]
*  very late in the race because an elderly man who could not be the president who everyone told [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=478.32s)]
*  whose function is the president for four years decided to this wind is wild huh yeah see [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  but but this was a very specific circumstance in which Kamala Harris ran for the presidency she was [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=492.32s)]
*  somewhat unpopular and she was not a star in democratic politics before this at all and her [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=498.32s)]
*  communication strategy was was pretty weak I think most people have admitted that so to hang [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=504.88s)]
*  this defeat all on a few podcasts and to say that they were the problem I never I don't buy I just [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=511.92s)]
*  don't buy the narrative so I don't think I'm a new establishment if you weigh again a few comedians [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  with podcasts verse all of the people that supported Kamala Harris you know democrat [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=527.04s)]
*  donors billionaires big people if the idea is that me and a few comedians have more power [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=535.28s)]
*  than multi-billionaires huge media institutions of whole political party apparatus I just don't [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=542.4s)]
*  think most people are going to buy that I think it seems like a great way to excuse [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  running an unpopular candidate on a platform that American people weren't sold on I think even [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=555.76s)]
*  beyond politics though even beyond the question of the election like again I know they're like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=562.32s)]
*  liberal Joe Rogan conversation is so dominant and I think not like uh nuanced enough but [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  there is power in a massive audience there's absolutely power in a massive audience but if [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=575.76s)]
*  you're saying that that power is equal to the CIA or all of these other people that are [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=580.32s)]
*  been very critical of President Trump right yeah so the idea that like the power that Theo von has [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  would be equal to like the intelligence agencies or these massive legacy media institutions [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=596.0s)]
*  seems crazy but you got way more audience than like like when you're saying we're we don't have [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=603.76s)]
*  power we're not the CIA well you know there's some gradations between that and also I'm sure [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=609.92s)]
*  there's like well just you use the word establishment yeah I didn't say that we [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=614.16s)]
*  didn't have any power or that audiences weren't powerful when you use the term establishment I [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=618.72s)]
*  think that that's more than just having an audience that's having an institutional [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=623.12s)]
*  component that I don't think we have but I think legacy media does I think the government and the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=629.68s)]
*  intelligence communities do I think Hollywood certainly does and I think all of those people [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  all of those power factions have worked together for a very very very long time so to say that a [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=642.48s)]
*  few comedians with podcasts equal that seems crazy I see why okay I understand that's the only thing [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=647.28s)]
*  I'm sorry okay so that ends what she does say she sees what he means well Jesus do you you see what [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  he means that the CIA might have slightly more power than Theo von you do recognize that point [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=665.1999999999999s)]
*  is somewhat rooted in reality well geez I should hope so I should hope that you would get that and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  there's look obviously what's going on here to some degree and I think in some senses intentionally [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=678.16s)]
*  is that the two of them are kind of speaking past each other like you know the thing that she is [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=685.52s)]
*  talking about because like the term the establishment is somewhat vague like if you're [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=691.92s)]
*  going to say like okay um there's this there's this group of podcasts uh very big podcasts that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=697.6s)]
*  JD Vance and and Donald Trump did and they ended up winning the election and so hey is this are [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=705.1999999999999s)]
*  these podcasters the new establishment well Tim is making the very legitimate point that typically [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=711.12s)]
*  when people use the word establishment what they're referring to is the people who control the power [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  and you know it's not again he doesn't say there's no power in having a large audience but you know [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=724.48s)]
*  there's other types of real hard power that say people who control militaries and police departments [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=731.36s)]
*  and taxation policy and you know uh control the money printers and control the public education [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=739.76s)]
*  and control the higher education and could you I you know there's a lot of power in that that is [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=747.52s)]
*  a whole different form of power than anything that you know uh Tom Segura has you know what I mean [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=752.16s)]
*  like there's it's just a different level of power and control and so let's be very precise here like [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=759.52s)]
*  what are we talking about again I think this is an interesting I wish almost they had drilled down [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=766.56s)]
*  a little bit more on this because I think it's like yes that's it look if you're talking about [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=772.0s)]
*  in terms of controlling policy well Theo von right he just went um super viral for this really [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  amazing uh clip of his his podcast where he's like being very real and just being touched by [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=786.72s)]
*  the fact that you know as he says we're living through a genocide in our lives that we're funding [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  and arming and we're just watching this happen it's goddamn heartbreaking now it seems to me if [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  someone had power you know then they'd probably try to stop us from funding and arming a genocide [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  but obviously as we all know Theo von is powerless to do anything about that other than to talk about [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=809.9200000000001s)]
*  it on his podcast so nobody here is really arguing that Joe Rogan has taken control of you know [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=814.64s)]
*  the central bank or the central intelligence agency or the senate or the house or the supreme [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=824.48s)]
*  court or the presidency or anything like that so specifically what they mean is that you had the [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=830.72s)]
*  power to help someone win an election you understand like that's a very different power [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=839.2s)]
*  than actually controlling a system but there is some argument to that I think that they but why [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=844.6400000000001s)]
*  is it why do they have that power and and the the reason is because the people stopped believing [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=851.84s)]
*  your bullshit that's the story of what happened here now the the reason for that is actually [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=861.12s)]
*  very very simple and it is unbelievable that almost no one in the corporate legacy media world [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=869.76s)]
*  seems to be capable of grappling with this most simple point and and the the the most simple point [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=879.92s)]
*  is simply that news okay if the world of news the commodity that you're you're um [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=887.92s)]
*  that you're trading in is your trustworthiness I mean that's the whole idea of news is that I'm [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=899.04s)]
*  going to report to you information that's supposed to be the job of a journalist to tell the story [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=907.52s)]
*  to their reader or their viewer once it's been demonstrated that you're a liar I can no longer [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=916.48s)]
*  go to you for news because it's a prerequisite that I can trust that you're not fucking lying [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=924.48s)]
*  to me when the whole business is to tell me the truth and the corporate media has proven [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=930.48s)]
*  over and over and over and over again that they are liars they are lying to the American people [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=940.24s)]
*  and say what you will about Tim Dillon and Joe Rogan and Theo Vaughn they are not liars [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=947.36s)]
*  you know they might be wrong about some stuff but they're not liars and their viewers know this [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=958.0s)]
*  and so yes it is true that they um enjoy more trust from their viewers than CNN or MSNBC or [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=963.2s)]
*  Fox News or someone like that does like okay but that if that's what you mean you see the the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=974.88s)]
*  differences between if you just say hey you're the new establishment well then obviously it it [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=981.36s)]
*  creates a situation it creates a lens where the onus would be on you now you know if you're the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=989.12s)]
*  new establishment then okay you're the ones we should be focused on you're the ones that we [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=996.48s)]
*  should be criticizing you're the ones who we should be making sure are living up to their you [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1002.08s)]
*  know to the people's expectations or to the pledges that you've made or something like that [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1007.44s)]
*  because you're the establishment now I mean say whatever you will about these guys but they're [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1011.68s)]
*  no longer the establishment you're the establishment now you're the ones we should be critical [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1015.2s)]
*  of but when you're more precise and you say okay well you guys have no real hard power um but the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1019.12s)]
*  people have completely lost trust in all of the institutions and therefore the people trust you [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1030.96s)]
*  now see when you say when you describe it more precisely then you realize that oh no our our [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1035.36s)]
*  sights should still be on those corrupt criminals who are still wielding hard power in our society [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1041.52s)]

*  one of the things that is really fascinating that they almost find you know it's like [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1142.8s)]
*  they almost find a way to overlook the fact that okay look even if you want to say let's say [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1151.12s)]
*  tim dillon and theovon and and joe rogan and andrew schultz and guys like this [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1162.1599999999999s)]
*  um tony henschcliffe guys like this they they supported trump in this election you could say [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1166.8s)]
*  they went all in for the trump administration it is still the case just factually speaking [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1173.52s)]
*  that this is a relatively small number of comedian celebrities who went behind donald trump and then [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1179.84s)]
*  you had an enormous amount of celebrities who opposed donald trump i mean from 2016 election [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1188.72s)]
*  2020 election 2024 election the list you know like if if you were to like say put out a list of [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1197.6000000000001s)]
*  whatever you know say a list celebrities so let's just say i'll put rogan and tim dillon as like a [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1205.04s)]
*  list celebrities now they're in the internet world but i certainly think they have as many [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1210.88s)]
*  fans as a listers so i'd feel comfortable putting them in that group okay but then still like your [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1216.0800000000002s)]
*  list of a listers so let's say you let's say you include like really really big successful comedians [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1222.96s)]
*  who supported donald trump so i'll give you like theovon joe rogan tony henschcliffe andrew schultz [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1228.3200000000002s)]
*  tim dillon say shane even i don't know did shane ever take a position but whatever was that okay [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1235.52s)]
*  that's six maybe there's there's a couple that i'm missing that you think would qualify as like a [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1240.8s)]
*  list celebrities who supported donald trump but there's maybe you could get to 10 10 can you [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1245.76s)]
*  imagine if you ran the list of a list celebrities who supported kamala harris the list would be like [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1253.36s)]
*  like i mean the you know it's it's a notable exception when there's one person in hollywood [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1258.48s)]
*  who isn't like a you know hardcore anti-trumper and you you know so again no one from cnn is [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1265.04s)]
*  sitting here and going like well hey taylor swift the person who just finished the biggest music [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1274.56s)]
*  tour in music history went all in for kamala harris robert de niro you know like like iconic [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1280.64s)]
*  people who were all anti-trump okay the complaint here is that yeah but what they did didn't work [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1287.68s)]
*  what they did didn't work people tuned them out and stopped listening to them so it's not like the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1297.52s)]
*  issue here isn't who is the establishment or who isn't the establishment it's like it's more [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1302.8s)]
*  something like who hasn't completely destroyed their own credibility i think that's much more [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1309.52s)]
*  uh that's a much more realistic lens to look at this through to actually understand what's going [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  on um here let's go uh to the next the next clip because this one is pretty interesting [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1321.1999999999998s)]
*  you know again i can mean you very successful left wing or left of center comics who are playing in [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1328.9599999999998s)]
*  theaters and arenas and have movies out and then i can name you some pot which apparently now [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1337.6799999999998s)]
*  there's five podcasters that dominate the whole world this is a crazy thing no but but this is [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1345.44s)]
*  every article that's been written since the election i understand five guys now are the only [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1351.68s)]
*  people in comedy who make money or have audiences it's the craziest narrative ever and it came off [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1355.76s)]
*  the heels of running one of the most unpopular candidates with a platform that the american [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1361.76s)]
*  people largely rejected they largely rejected a plan for this platform and they rejected it in [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  2016 and then everybody got together and said it's actually these five guys who had podcasts [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1371.76s)]
*  they're the most powerful people in the world they're the new establishment and they're the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1378.96s)]
*  reason for this electoral defeat not our unpopular policies and our candidates who ran on a platform [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1382.72s)]
*  of jewelry you know again so there's uh you know again it's um so there's you know i think tim [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1390.56s)]
*  almost in a way here i mean he's right about what he's saying but he could make the point [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1400.88s)]
*  you know even further and it's like it's not just that they ran um an unpopular candidate i mean [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1406.72s)]
*  obviously like that's a huge component of this here um they're you know camala harris was just [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1414.24s)]
*  uniquely terrible as a candidate and it the it seemed like as is often the case that the kind [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1420.8000000000002s)]
*  of democratic establishment and and the corporate media who are essentially indistinguishable from [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1429.12s)]
*  each other they their their strategy seemed to be to to deny reality um and it was almost in an [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1434.56s)]
*  attempt to convince you that the reality you're seeing didn't in fact exist but so rather than [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1444.4799999999998s)]
*  like say grapple with the fact early on like camala harris is terribly unpopular and probably [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1452.08s)]
*  cannot beat donald trump it was she's a rock star she's barack obama in 2007 you see that which was [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1456.08s)]
*  all just made up and so like there's a huge component of that but i think what's actually [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1463.4399999999998s)]
*  much bigger than that um and this is part of the reason why biden was in trouble and camala harris [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  was in trouble um is that the the every every position every major position that the democratic [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1474.48s)]
*  establishment has staked out over the last 10 years has just not only is it unpopular it's [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  demonstrably false based on lies it is it's so bad that none of them will even say the thing they [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1496.8000000000002s)]
*  were saying at the time right now like nobody camala harris wouldn't even run on what she was [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1506.24s)]
*  in 2020 because it was all so unpopular you know is it like she she'd have to run away from every [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1515.1200000000001s)]
*  position because just a couple years later you can't even defend the thing you were saying back [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1521.04s)]
*  then and this is true on every major issue like they were all saying donald trump was involved in [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1525.2s)]

*  the the list of like all the people who were arguing that if you get the covid vaccine you [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1560.72s)]
*  can't get or transmit covid none of them are saying that anymore because it's so obviously [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1567.44s)]
*  been proven wrong that you just got to abandon that and move on to the next thing none of them [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1572.0800000000002s)]
*  are saying joe biden sharp is attack anymore because it's so it's just abandoned because [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1576.0s)]
*  it's so obviously wrong nobody is saying that ukraine can recapture all of its territory anymore [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1580.0s)]
*  nobody like there's just all of these things they all fall apart and you can only do that for so [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1585.6000000000001s)]
*  long before you lose everybody's trust you know at a different point in the interview [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  she was uh she she grills him on that like are there left-wing comedians and it's like dude there's [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1596.88s)]
*  so many goddamn left-wing comedians it's insane that the question ever gets asked it's insane look [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  just think about it like this there are because this really does go to the the question of who's [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1609.3600000000001s)]
*  the establishment like there are multi-billion dollar networks okay there there's a a bunch of [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1615.52s)]
*  late night comedians who have network tv shows all of them are trumpeters all of them have just [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1626.56s)]
*  been carrying water for the democratic establishment for at least the last eight years and there's [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1633.52s)]
*  you know steven colbert and jimmy kimmel are are pushing vaccine propaganda at the height of [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1639.6s)]
*  covid and demonizing the unvaccinated and uh you know making it very clear that they're they're all [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1645.28s)]
*  in on being anti-trump so it's not like look if if joe rogan and tim dillon are the establishment [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1651.84s)]
*  well why aren't the giant multi-billion dollar corporations getting behind them in that same [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1662.8s)]
*  type of way and don't get me wrong there's been a little they've been kind of slowly like netflix [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1668.4s)]
*  has started having real comedians back on but also that you know a big part of it is because [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1673.68s)]
*  they just dominated in the market and eventually netflix lost and was like well i guess we got to [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1679.3600000000001s)]
*  go to where the audience is the so the point is that the establishment is still behind all of [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1683.2s)]
*  those guys it's just that their audiences aren't their audiences abandon them because they're [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1690.72s)]
*  they're just i don't know it's boring and they're liars and and look there's [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1697.92s)]
*  the the what happened is right it's not that again these guys had every advantage these were the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1704.08s)]
*  guys who were given multi-million dollar contracts from multi-billion dollar transnational corporations [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1711.76s)]
*  these are the guys who were given every then there's some other guys who just went over here to [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1717.3600000000001s)]
*  the internet and just started talking into a camera and the viewers flooded over to those people [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1721.9199999999998s)]
*  who were over here now i don't think that makes them the establishment i think because again if [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1727.84s)]
*  you phrase it this way it's really it's pretty anti-democratic when you think about it because [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1732.32s)]
*  you're almost like arguing that there's a problem with the people having another option of who to go [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1738.56s)]
*  listen to look a lot of a lot of what it comes down to and i think the reason why because like [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1744.8s)]
*  i think almost if you're trying to be as charitable as possible you could say like that this this girl [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1752.48s)]
*  the thing she's touching on is that okay yeah it's true that like you know sarah silverman or um [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1759.36s)]
*  you know i don't know any you know comedian who's been in movies over the last you know it's true [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1770.72s)]
*  that um whatever sarah silverman or um um uh what's his name or am i thinking of the uh like the [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1776.8s)]
*  the seth rogan right okay so like yeah those guys all hate donald trump but you know no one's really [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1786.24s)]
*  it's not really resonating with anyone like they don't really have juice like that like they might [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1795.6s)]
*  be famous hollywood people but they don't have like the the same type of like energy behind them [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1800.24s)]
*  that rogan or theo von or one of these guys has and like there is some truth to that but again [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  it's not because the establishment is behind the other guys and not behind them it's it's quite [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1813.28s)]
*  demonstrably obviously the case that it's the opposite the establishment is still totally [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1818.6399999999999s)]
*  behind those guys i mean they the establishment tried to counsel joe rogan and you know they [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1823.2s)]
*  failed but they tried so what's really happening is you might ask yourself it's like why is it [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1830.0s)]
*  that all of the never trump liberal comedians lost all of their street cred why is it that like [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1837.1200000000001s)]
*  they don't they don't connect to their audience like that and and even in some examples where [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1844.24s)]
*  maybe they do connect to their audience like the audience might still think their last movie was [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1849.76s)]
*  funny or something like that they just they're not interested in their political endorsements [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1854.32s)]
*  they're not interested in like the ideas that these people believe in um much like look taylor [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1858.72s)]
*  swift i think was a great example of that i mean look she this chick had the most successful tour [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1863.6s)]
*  in the history of tours endorsed kamala harrison it did nothing to move the needle because i think [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1869.76s)]
*  even her own audience which still might really love taylor swift just kind of tune that out [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1876.32s)]
*  they're like yeah whatever we're not really looking for your political advice thanks [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1881.2s)]

*  in the conversation with comedians i think that like my my feeling on it is that i think comedians [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1948.64s)]
*  are kind of like they're they're expected to be gangsters in some sense now comedians are expected [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1958.16s)]
*  to say the hilarious thing even when it offends people they're kind of expected to not [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1968.48s)]
*  um they're expected to not bow down when pressures put on them and i think there's almost no way [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1977.3600000000001s)]
*  you you could there's no way that you could maintain the respect of your audience [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1987.36s)]
*  after something like that and what i think what we saw um over between several different things [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=1994.32s)]
*  but it was really it was the rise of wokeism it was donald trump getting elected and it was [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2001.84s)]
*  coveted and then there were other little stories after that that kind of all fell in line but [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2007.52s)]
*  something in those years happened where it exposed the um the level of cowardice [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2012.72s)]
*  that a lot of these comedians had and and a lot of it is because you know a lot of people wanted to [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2020.8799999999999s)]
*  be successful more than they really believed in what they were saying um that's always been it's [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2029.1999999999998s)]
*  like a a fatal flaw in human beings in general you know like you could have you could have a really [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2035.6s)]
*  great politician say um and i don't mean like a skilled politician i mean like a really good [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2041.44s)]
*  person who wanted to get into politics and maybe they have some issues that they really believe in [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2047.04s)]
*  but maybe they want to be president more than they believe in those issues like their major [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2052.4s)]
*  motivation is like i want to have this power and we all know that's going to ruin that person [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2057.92s)]
*  because at some point your your principles and the desire for power are going to come into conflict [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2063.52s)]
*  and if you desire the value for power more you're going to end up compromising your principles in [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2069.04s)]
*  order to get that same thing with a lot of comedians a lot of them cared more about being [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2073.2s)]
*  famous more about being successful than about the craft and when that happens if those things come [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2078.08s)]
*  into conflict you're gonna go you're gonna take the easy path we saw this a ton i mean there was [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2085.44s)]
*  um there were there was so much that needed to be mocked and made fun of in wokeism that so many [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2091.92s)]
*  comedians just refused to touch even as the most ridiculous thing is happening all around you [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2101.6000000000004s)]
*  you refuse to make fun of it because you just don't want to get in trouble and then um when [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2107.1200000000003s)]
*  when trump got elected it was like they just kind of a lot of them just developed what's known as [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2114.88s)]
*  trumped arrangement syndrome a lot of them like kind of shut down the funny aspect of what they [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2124.0s)]
*  were doing because they just wanted to fall in line and and send the message to everyone that [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2130.56s)]
*  they're like a good little soldier and then of course through cobit they just like completely [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2136.72s)]
*  disgrace themselves and to the point that when john stewart went on steven colbert's show and [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2140.64s)]
*  made the most obvious joke don't get me wrong it's hilarious it was the most obvious joke about how [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2146.72s)]
*  this thing clearly came from the lab at the time you can see how uncomfortable steven colbert is [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2152.24s)]
*  and he's trying to talk over him and at the time it did really feel like a dangerous thing like [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2157.92s)]
*  you were like yo is he really saying this i mean you'll get kicked off youtube for saying this but [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2162.16s)]
*  john stewart's saying it on tv right now okay but think about that that was only a couple years ago [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2166.4s)]
*  and now everyone knows he was right and the expectation is that we're supposed to forget [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2173.04s)]
*  that steven colbert was such a bitch through all of that time we're supposed to forget that you know [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2179.44s)]
*  it's like you just don't that's just not going to happen and look even someone like john stewart [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2186.32s)]
*  at least when compared to those other ones still has more street credit than any of those guys do [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2190.8s)]
*  because hey you know on some level you got to go hey he kind of is a real one he kind of is a real [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2196.4s)]
*  one you know bill maher also still maintained some degree of street cred because at least he [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2202.0s)]
*  didn't become a total bitch throughout all these years at least he'd still say a thing or two [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2207.52s)]
*  against the mob by the way john stewart and bill maher who are still you know i don't know what the [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2212.32s)]
*  what the ratings on the uh the daily show are these days um but i have seen i think like some [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2220.4s)]
*  of his video clips are still doing great numbers online bill maher still has good ratings on his [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2226.64s)]
*  show and it's still a relevant show bill maher and john stewart are i mean throw steven colbert in [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2231.52s)]
*  there the most consequential political comedians of the last 20 years and so isn't it like it's [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2240.48s)]
*  kind of interesting i remember one time um when he was trashing uh the legion of skanks before he [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2247.28s)]
*  he walked it back and did kind of apologize so i give him a credit for that um but i remember [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2254.2400000000002s)]
*  anthony jeselnick was talking about how um and colter used to come hang out at the comedy cellar [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2259.44s)]

*  sometimes she was a comedy fan and jeselnick was talking about how furious he'd be when he walked in [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2278.0800000000004s)]
*  and an colter was at the table in the back and he's like why are we even being friendly with her like [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2284.32s)]
*  fuck her she's the worst you know this awful conservative lady and i remember um thinking to [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2288.2400000000002s)]
*  myself that it really it kind of demonstrated this um kind of uh privilege if you will to borrow a [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2293.44s)]
*  word from the left uh that you you know i think a lot of people maybe if you've never if you've [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2301.28s)]
*  never been like a liberal who lived in a real red area or a conservative who lived in a real blue [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  area maybe it's it's hard for you to see uh as somebody who's like a radical libertarian [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2314.96s)]
*  who's from new york city and has done comedy for 20 years in the new york city area that's just [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2322.48s)]
*  something that you know you you get confronted with a lot more but when someone the thing that [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2328.16s)]
*  was kind of revealing to me about jeselnick's comments is it's like oh you don't even you don't [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  even recognize your own privilege here privilege and i'm using it kind of tongue in cheek but [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2337.52s)]
*  i mean that you don't recognize that you just take it for granted that you should never be around [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2342.64s)]
*  somebody who disagrees with you because everybody else who would be at that back table are all [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2350.48s)]
*  fucking liberals or left-wingers 100 of them or 99 of them so you're almost like myth that there [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2356.08s)]
*  was this one time when there was a conservative around it you know from the perspective of like [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2363.2s)]
*  a libertarian in new york city you're like geez one person one time i mean that's every every time [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2366.96s)]
*  i go anywhere everyone there disagrees with me politically but like okay whatever it's that's [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2373.36s)]
*  not the end-all be-all in life but so it is like so you're going to imagine your perspective being [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2379.04s)]
*  that like there you have you have bill maher and john stewart and stephen colbert and jimmy kimmel [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2385.76s)]
*  and just all and all the a-list hollywood people like all of them all in for the democrats always [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2392.2400000000002s)]
*  like that's just always the state of things and then for the first time there's like a group of [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2399.5200000000004s)]
*  five comedians who have audiences who are like you know i'm open to the other side maybe the [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2405.6000000000004s)]
*  democrats aren't the party to vote for maybe we should consider voting for this party and you're [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2413.12s)]
*  furious about this change it's like okay but that then understand your issue is that you expected [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2418.48s)]
*  to have a monopoly on the entire thing and and that's just not going to be the case and i think [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2424.48s)]
*  that hopefully one of the lessons that's kind of taken from all of this because we're never going [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2431.8399999999997s)]
*  to be you know we're never going to be a society that doesn't have liberals and leftists in it [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2439.84s)]
*  i also by the way i think there's a like a needed role for liberals and leftists in society you know [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2446.0800000000004s)]
*  you don't you want to limit how much power they have but there there is like we're going to have [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2453.28s)]
*  the other like both halves of america speaking broadly like the left half of america and the [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2460.0s)]
*  right half of america they all have to get out of their head the idea that you're going to [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2465.36s)]
*  vanquish the other side like that they will be eliminated and never you know what i mean be a [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2470.32s)]
*  part of society again or something like that um this is just it's not possible to do that and it's [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2475.92s)]
*  not going to happen but you would hope that as a result of whatever this massive cultural shift [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2482.08s)]
*  that we're living through is that people would recognize that it's like oh yeah there is a price [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2488.48s)]
*  tag associated with burning your credibility to the ground like if you just lie and lie and lie [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2494.8s)]
*  over and over and over again eventually you won't be trusted and if you're a comedian and you just [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2503.36s)]
*  bitch out over and over and over again your opinion will not be valued because that's kind [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2509.6800000000003s)]
*  of like that's an expectation that people have from comedians and i think rightfully so that [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2516.1600000000003s)]
*  if you know if you're saying something if you're mocking the absurdities of the powerful [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2523.3599999999997s)]
*  um you're not going to bite your tongue just because you're worried it might make you look [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2531.9199999999996s)]
*  bad you know lennie bruce went to jail and george carlin went to jail so that they could do their act [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2536.0s)]
*  and the whole lore of those guys that they wouldn't stop doing their act it's like even under the [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2542.3199999999997s)]
*  threat of actual violence the truth is that stephen colbert and jimmy kimmel and all these guys [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2547.2s)]
*  they never had a threat of anything like that the threat was like what someone might say some mean [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2552.56s)]
*  things about you and then you just have to go cry into your piles of tens of millions of dollars [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2558.3199999999997s)]
*  and that was enough to make you bitch out well then how would how would you have that energy [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2563.9199999999996s)]
*  with like your base anymore and anyway i just think it's been uh it's been pretty interesting [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2569.44s)]
*  to watch uh and it's again you see it's just one more attempt of cnn trying to grapple [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2578.7200000000003s)]
*  with something in a sense trying to over complicate it when it's really actually very very simple [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2588.08s)]
*  it's like you had all the advantages you had the culture completely controlled you had the flow of [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2594.48s)]
*  information completely controlled there was a mix of two things that happened two fairly [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2600.08s)]
*  straightforward simple things number one the technology evolved to the point where there was [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2606.16s)]
*  a much lower barrier of entry people could get in to you know the if you got probably a few hundred [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2611.6800000000003s)]
*  bucks you could put together a little studio certainly for a few thousand dollars you can [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  um there's you could put your your stuff out there in a way where you didn't need networks you didn't [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2624.56s)]
*  need billion dollar corporations behind you and then number number two was that with all of that [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2629.8399999999997s)]
*  control and dominance you squandered your entire reputation and trust in you evaporated and people [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2636.48s)]
*  were looking for somewhere else to go and they've found it um that's pretty much the story [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2643.68s)]
*  and that is very different than becoming the new establishment it's more like um becoming the new [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2652.3999999999996s)]
*  voice of the people something much closer to that okay let me uh let's for the further rest of the [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2658.96s)]
*  show here i guess i got a little bit of time left but let me you know i was thinking i i alluded to [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2666.64s)]
*  this on the last podcast and then after uh the show i was like i probably should actually play [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2670.88s)]
*  this clip on the show because it is worth um responding to so let's let's play this clip [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2677.28s)]
*  this is of course what i was referring to is the uh it was michael knolls over at the daily wire [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2683.92s)]
*  um i find it very interesting that it seems there seems to be such a split um between the uh and i [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2689.76s)]
*  mean this on the right amongst trump supporters among amongst trump's base there is this huge [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2700.32s)]
*  split over foreign policy and um part of it is generational uh the younger generation is really [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2706.48s)]
*  just uh less supportive of israel less support supportive of of war in general um whereas the [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2717.92s)]
*  older uh uh republican voters are still more typically the way they you know traditionally [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2725.04s)]
*  were but i do find this to be a very interesting kind of dynamic where you've got guys who are at [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2731.44s)]
*  the daily wire particularly matt walsh and and michael knolls who essentially you know they're [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2740.16s)]
*  they're you know putting themselves in the america first flag kind of in the non-interventionist [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2747.12s)]
*  camp uh they still of course cannot be critical of israel because they work at the daily wire [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2752.88s)]
*  and the daily wire is owned by people whose highest priority is israel and so they're kind [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2758.0s)]
*  of stuck in this in this weird position but they they realize that they have to find a way to play [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2763.76s)]
*  to the the younger audience who just is completely opposed to the all of this stuff [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2772.2400000000002s)]
*  they're now look i don't want to get this wrong i don't want to um be misleading here because it's [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2780.32s)]
*  not as if it's not i don't think it's like 80 percent of the republican voters are are critical [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2785.92s)]
*  of of the wars and critical of israel um or at least our support of israel um i don't know exactly [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  what the percentage split is i know there has been a lot of interesting polling on this where it's [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2801.36s)]
*  very clear that the younger generation is really moving away uh from from believing that the u.s. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2804.96s)]
*  should be funding and arming israel but there there's no question that there's there's a big [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2810.48s)]
*  split and there is one side is backed by the establishment and the other side is the dissident [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2819.28s)]
*  group right the establishment there's no question about that wants to continue the war uh the war [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2826.8s)]
*  machine and wants to continue you know funding uh and and arming israel's destruction of gaza [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2831.52s)]
*  and then helping them in their next steps as well anyway this was the um the uh the clip that i was [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2838.32s)]
*  referring to on yesterday's show so let's play it and uh and we'll respond a little bit [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2845.7599999999998s)]
*  i have yet to hear anyone make a persuasive argument that the state of israel is not justified [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2851.92s)]
*  the state of israel is not justified in going to war against gaza and and even in continuing the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2857.28s)]
*  war against gaza i sort of wish they wouldn't because i care about this more from the american [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2863.1200000000003s)]
*  national interest and the longer this war goes on the more volatility is created and the greater [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2866.96s)]
*  the risk of the united states being dragged into a war so from the american perspective i would kind [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2872.0s)]
*  of like the war to wrap up but from the from the israeli perspective can someone please explain to [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2876.0800000000004s)]
*  me how the war is not already so okay so michael moz this is what i thought was so interesting [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2882.64s)]
*  about this so he's going to start by saying you know i have not heard anybody um make a compelling [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2889.6s)]
*  argument for why um why israel was was not justified in going to war with gaza now obviously i disagree [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2896.4s)]
*  with that we can get into that in a second and i think i think i've made some pretty compelling [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2905.92s)]
*  arguments about that i will i will try my best to to do that again but i did think this was the most [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2909.44s)]
*  fascinating moment where then even he has to admit that look from the american perspective [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2914.88s)]
*  obviously this isn't good for us we'd like this war to be wrapped up today right um we would [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2922.32s)]
*  that would as as he says it's creating a lot of turmoil for us over here i mean look there's no [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2929.76s)]
*  question about that right and particularly um look we're having a massive um protests in our [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2935.12s)]
*  country that's never good um i i think particularly from the the conservative point of view when you [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2943.44s)]
*  value order and stability now again just to be clear i'm not saying that it's never a good thing [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2950.72s)]
*  to protest i'm saying it's never a good thing to even have to protest like everybody should agree [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2958.24s)]
*  with that you're better off if there's not even an issue that a huge portion of your your population [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2963.68s)]
*  thinks is so goddamn awful that we got to get out on the streets and start agitating and creating [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2969.2s)]
*  problems obviously everybody should agree it would be better to not have those issues um it's also [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2973.2799999999997s)]
*  just undeniably the case that this is um the israel's destruction of gaza has been dividing [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2980.3199999999997s)]
*  both major political factions and this was a huge huge problem in kamala harris's campaign um [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2989.04s)]
*  obviously you know she was uh she was interrupted by protesters many times at her events she had to [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=2995.76s)]
*  speak out of both sides of her mouth every time israel palestine came up because she had this huge [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3000.96s)]
*  problem where like you know 50 percent of your base views this as a genocide so they view your [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3005.36s)]
*  current administration as funding a genocide and then you've got all these big money donors and [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3014.08s)]
*  you've got all these other voting constituents who are like wildly pro israel well shit how the hell [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3019.6s)]
*  do you end up putting this coalition together to get enough votes to win um this was a major [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3024.4s)]
*  problem it's a major part of the reason why kamala harris lost um i think there's no question about [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3029.2799999999997s)]
*  this it really really hurt them and it was also as i talked about um at length on the show it was [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3033.2s)]
*  also part of the reason why there was no there was no um there was no energy to protest donald [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3038.96s)]

*  very bad for the democrats it was a big problem for them um it's also a major problem for donald [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3068.56s)]

*  supreme court the last thing you want is some major issue that your base is divided on it's it's so [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3089.2799999999997s)]

*  this is bad for america okay and then that's not that's to speak nothing of the risk of us getting [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3106.4s)]

*  all right let's get back on the show okay so he says okay from the american perspective i can [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3178.8799999999997s)]
*  i want this to end very quickly but from the israeli perspective i don't see how they're not [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3185.2799999999997s)]
*  justified in fighting this war so before even getting into that isn't the admission here just [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3190.4s)]
*  so profound because i'm sorry but who gives a shit about the israeli perspective [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3198.48s)]
*  why the hell should i care about that i mean it's just like could not be we're americans [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3207.04s)]
*  you're an american a catholic american you're an american talking to an american audience about [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3214.7999999999997s)]
*  american politics why the hell should we be funding something that is against our interests [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3221.44s)]
*  because it's in the interest of a foreign country could anything be more the antithesis of america [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3228.72s)]
*  first so if your admission here is that this is against our interests but for another country's [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3234.56s)]
*  interest well then okay it might make sense for that other country to pursue this policy but it [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3242.32s)]
*  sure as hell does not make sense for us to fund it and so if you're going to be making a comment [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3248.1600000000003s)]
*  in this time now michael knolls might be able to wiggle out of this by saying oh yeah no i agree [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3252.7200000000003s)]
*  i'm also saying we shouldn't fund this i'm just saying from their perspective it makes sense it's [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3257.6000000000004s)]
*  like okay fine that would be fine to argue if we weren't funding it but while we are funding [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3261.44s)]
*  something that is a by your own admission against our country's interests and pretty profoundly so [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3267.7599999999998s)]
*  then how is it not incumbent on you to criticize the funding of that that i like even if what he [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3274.7999999999997s)]
*  was saying is true which it's not but let's just say israel was justified in doing what they're [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3280.64s)]
*  doing but we're still funding something that's against our interest then it's incumbent on you [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3284.72s)]
*  to be criticizing that to be criticizing the fact that we're prioritizing the interests of [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3290.24s)]
*  a foreign country over our own i don't i don't see how you can get around this you know it's like a [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3296.32s)]
*  lot of these daily wire guys they're trying to to find a way to sit on the fence they're like look i [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3304.0800000000004s)]
*  can't ignore like all the obvious good points here but i also don't want to criticize israel at all [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3312.32s)]
*  the problem is that i just i don't think it's possible to be in the middle on this one [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3318.8s)]
*  and just don't see how you can how you can even argue that um all right let's here let's play the [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3323.28s)]
*  the rest of the clip the gaza invaded on october 7th and killed a bunch of people and took hostages [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3330.8s)]
*  the state of israel responded and still has not gotten all of the hostages back [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3344.0800000000004s)]
*  furthermore the state of israel now is looking at gaza and saying okay well hamas in power is an [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3351.2s)]
*  unacceptable security risk we cannot tolerate that so we have to do something to change it [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3357.6s)]
*  furthermore the people in gaza when they had a modicum of self-government chose to elect [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3362.64s)]
*  tamas which carried out carried out the attack so if you're the state of israel it seems to me [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3368.32s)]
*  that pretty much all of the criteria of just war that we have understood from classical antiquity [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3374.08s)]
*  up through the middle ages up to the present are fulfilled here in going to war and in continuing [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3380.88s)]
*  the war can someone explain to me i have an open mind i am i am easily persuadable if someone can [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3387.28s)]
*  make a good argument i haven't heard anyone making the argument okay so let's uh see if we can't [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3393.76s)]
*  persuade michael knolls here and i'll i i certainly have been making the argument so okay first of all [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3398.88s)]
*  i would say that um yeah if you want to look at things strictly from the israeli point of view [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3404.1600000000003s)]
*  once again not exactly sure why the hell we should be looking at things that way but if you want to [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3411.44s)]
*  look at things from the israeli point of view and completely ignore all of the elements of the [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3416.4s)]
*  history that make them look very bad then sure you could come to this conclusion but you know [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3421.6800000000003s)]
*  two quick things number one um adjust just war theory doesn't it doesn't give you carte blanche [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3427.4399999999996s)]
*  it doesn't mean that you can now prosecute the war in whatever manner you want to [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3436.56s)]
*  even if you were attacked by a foreign country and therefore you're going to argue you have a right [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3441.04s)]
*  to go to war with them that doesn't mean like you have a right to go in there and just start [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3446.16s)]
*  slitting babies throats and raping women or something like that there are still expectations [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3450.8799999999997s)]
*  on how you ought to conduct that war but tell me this um from the with the entire history of like [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3454.64s)]
*  the just war theory being worked out has anybody ever argued that you could occupy a group of people [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3463.3599999999997s)]
*  for 60 years then intentionally fund a terrorist organization to prop them up and keep them in [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3470.7999999999997s)]
*  power so you can deny the people the right to ever get out from underneath your occupation and then [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3478.0s)]
*  after the terrorist group that you funded launches a terrorist attack use that as an excuse to [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3484.64s)]
*  slaughter the people in this tiny strip of land that you have occupied and dominated since 1967 [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3490.56s)]
*  was that part ever included in the just war theory no i don't think it was because that changes the [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3498.96s)]
*  dynamic a little bit like i know like everybody who wants to look at this from the israeli point of [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3505.12s)]
*  view always wants to like they want to tell the story as if these were just two neighboring [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3511.44s)]
*  countries these are just two neighboring countries you know different governments and then one [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3518.48s)]
*  government attacked the other one and then they do this crazy thing where they just hide amongst [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3523.92s)]
*  the civilians so what are you going to do except start slaughtering people but you know of course [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3529.36s)]
*  that's not the case this is not the case this is nothing like mexico attacking the united states [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3533.2s)]
*  of america this is more like as as i'm not the first one to make this analogy but it's much more [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3538.64s)]
*  like an indian reservation attacking americans but not in 2025 more like in you know 1840 or [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3544.08s)]
*  something like that okay and now this isn't say like the the way we you know think of native [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3556.48s)]
*  americans in this country right like okay look we all know that the forming of the united states of [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3562.7999999999997s)]
*  america involved like we do realize there were some people here before europeans came over and [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3567.76s)]
*  that some not so nice things happened to those people okay and we know that like with every [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3573.28s)]
*  you know like expansion of the united states westward that was kind of an issue that we kept [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3578.8s)]
*  dealing with right there were people there and those people aren't really there anymore okay [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3583.5200000000004s)]
*  however in 2025 in america yes there are like indian reservations but you know they're allowed [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3589.28s)]
*  to come and go yes there are native americans but they also have citizenship in the united [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3595.36s)]
*  states of america so now imagine we did all the shit we did to native americans we put them on [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3600.08s)]
*  reservations but we never gave them citizenship we don't let them leave the the reservations [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3605.92s)]
*  without permission we don't allow them to trade from the reservations with the rest of the world [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3611.6s)]
*  we don't allow them to have a seaport or an airport we don't allow electricity to get through [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3615.6s)]
*  or we control the amount of electricity we control the water we control their tax revenue [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3620.48s)]
*  we control their currency and then in a situation where they have no you know army no navy no air [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3624.88s)]
*  force no nothing no government then a bunch of them broke out and killed a bunch of innocent people [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3632.88s)]
*  it doesn't follow just war theory that you're allowed to now slaughter the reservation [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3639.92s)]
*  okay there's like it's not mexico attacking america it's a completely different situation [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3644.8s)]

*  could agree or disagree with that argument but I certainly am presenting an argument now again [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3754.56s)]
*  as I've said from the beginning of the war if you want to just look at things from the Israeli [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3761.44s)]
*  perspective again not sure why we're doing that but if you just look at things from the Israeli [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3766.72s)]
*  perspective I'm not going to argue with you that like hey look if my if one of my kids was like a [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3771.68s)]
*  teenager at that rave festival thing who got killed by one of these Hamas terrorists or [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3778.16s)]
*  something like that I'm sure I could see myself being like fucking flat in Gaza and totally [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3784.64s)]
*  support what they're doing not if I had a hostage over there because you know that's actually not [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3790.72s)]
*  the best thing to get hostages out alive but I could understand sure I put myself in that position [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3795.12s)]
*  where I'd be so goddamn furious like fuck that we're going to kill all these people [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3800.48s)]
*  however if you're doing this you might notice Michael Knowles he hit the American perspective [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3803.76s)]
*  first yada yada over the fact that that perspective is we want the war to end and yet we're funding it [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3812.0s)]
*  to continue then he goes right to the Israeli perspective there's one perspective missing here [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3817.92s)]
*  you know there's one so now if we're going to do this let's go to the perspective of Palestinians [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3826.2400000000002s)]
*  and from their perspective they've been dominated controlled slaughtered ethnically cleansed and [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3834.2400000000002s)]
*  kept in extreme poverty for nearly 60 years by this regime from their perspective it also might [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3841.2000000000003s)]
*  make sense to violently respond to that the final point here is that we should be able to like look [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3850.0800000000004s)]
*  at the Israeli perspective look at the Palestinian perspective maybe gain some insight from that [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3857.92s)]
*  ultimately we should only care about the perspective of the United States of America [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3863.44s)]
*  that's the perspective that we should care about and Michael Knowles already admits that from that [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3867.2000000000003s)]
*  perspective we want the war to end so why the fuck are we funding a thing that is not in our [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3871.84s)]
*  interests that's all all right let's wrap up the show there I gotta head over to the SoHo forum [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYnXi55EdRo&t=3877.68s)]
