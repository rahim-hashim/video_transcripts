*  All right. So let's get into today's show. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  There are a few things that I really wanted to talk about. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=111.5s)]
*  There's let's start with with Donald Trump, who sat down with Kristen Walker. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=115.1s)]
*  I do not. For the life of me, I do not understand why Donald Trump still does interviews [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=124.46s)]
*  with these people. I just I don't get it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=130.42s)]
*  It's like your isn't your whole thing that you broke this media apparatus. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  Why? It just look, whatever. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=136.66s)]
*  He could talk to whoever he wants to. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=139.06s)]
*  People sure do enjoy him owning the journalists and stuff like that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=140.82000000000002s)]
*  I just don't when it seems like you're it seems like you're breathing life back into [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  your enemy institution that you already crushed. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=150.74s)]
*  Why go give them a thing that's going to be big ratings? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  That is beyond me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=156.86s)]
*  There was one moment in the conversation that's really been going viral. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=158.94s)]
*  It is Donald Trump discussing the ramifications of his tariff policy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=163.9s)]
*  And so here, let's let's let's play it and then respond. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  I was personally myself a little bit surprised that he took this this line. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=175.06s)]
*  But let's watch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=181.46s)]
*  Said this week got a lot of attention. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=183.26000000000002s)]
*  You were at your cabinet meeting. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=185.98000000000002s)]
*  You said, quote, I'm going to quote what you said. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=187.34s)]
*  Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  Are you saying that your tariffs will cause some prices to go up? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  No, I think it's going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=201.38s)]
*  But you said some dolls are going to cost more. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=204.98s)]
*  Isn't that an acknowledgement that some prices will go up? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=206.66s)]
*  I don't think a beautiful baby girl needs that's 11 years old, needs to have 30 dolls. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=209.54s)]
*  I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=216.82s)]
*  was just unbelievable. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=221.98s)]
*  We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=223.06s)]
*  When you say they could have three dolls instead of 30 dolls, are you saying you're [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=227.82s)]
*  they don't need Americans can see empty store shelves? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=231.9s)]
*  No, I'm no, I'm not saying that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=234.94s)]
*  I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dollars. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=236.74s)]
*  I can have three. They don't need to have 250 pencils. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=238.86s)]
*  They can have five. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=241.66s)]
*  Said this week got a lot of. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=242.82s)]
*  All right. So this was the comment from Donald Trump that is drawing a lot of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=244.82s)]
*  scrutiny. And I got to say here, Rob, I think, listen, I think we've tried our best to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=250.18s)]
*  do a good job here of just like calling balls and strikes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=257.7s)]
*  So like I will be the first one to give Donald Trump credit when he does something good. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  I'll be the first one to criticize him when I think he does something wrong. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=264.14s)]
*  I'll be the first one to defend him when I think he's being unfairly, you know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=266.78s)]
*  villainized by the corporate media or whatever. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=271.74s)]
*  This is retarded bullshit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=275.7s)]
*  This is just ridiculous. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=279.29999999999995s)]
*  It's ridiculous on so many goddamn levels. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  First of all, it's like you can't have it both ways, dude. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=283.14s)]
*  You can't say that like, maybe you only need two dollars. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=286.58s)]
*  You don't need five hundred dollars or whatever. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=290.06s)]
*  But then also go, oh, no, but it's not going to raise prices at all. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=292.29999999999995s)]
*  It's like, which one are you talking about here? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=295.46s)]
*  I also, by the way, you know, I do I find this in a weird way to be kind of an [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  interesting topic. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=303.82s)]
*  This is something that I've I've talked a lot about with like close friends and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=305.26s)]
*  family members about just how we get our kids too much stuff these days. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=309.46s)]
*  And like, I do feel like my house is just like covered in toys. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=315.98s)]
*  And I was like, you know, maybe in some way, like if my kids had less toys, they'd [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=321.18s)]
*  appreciate the ones they have more or something like that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=324.42s)]
*  But that's a very different conversation than a conversation about a government [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=326.98s)]
*  policy that makes it more expensive to get your kids toys. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=331.3s)]
*  And I'm curious to get your thoughts on this, but I just for a few reasons, I [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=335.34s)]
*  find this to be totally indefensible. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=340.09999999999997s)]
*  And OK, here's one of the major ones. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, a couple of them. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=345.9s)]
*  I mean, obviously, the point that we've made a million times that you could keep [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=346.7s)]
*  making, he could just sit here and assert that the tariffs are going to make us [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=349.26s)]
*  rich again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=353.62s)]
*  It's like, well, which one is it? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=354.78s)]
*  If we are we going to be getting more dolls or less dolls? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=357.26s)]
*  You know, like, what are you talking about here? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  But if you're saying the tariffs are going to make us rich, you got a whole lot of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=363.94s)]
*  problems there. Like, why? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=366.7s)]
*  OK, then like, why? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=368.18s)]
*  Why wouldn't a full blockade make us rich? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=370.22s)]
*  Why? Why do we trade with the world at all? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=372.42s)]
*  Then why don't we get super rich and just never trade with them? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=374.1s)]
*  Why don't we make ourselves if the principle applies, let's stop trading [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=377.26s)]
*  between the states. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  Right. Like, let the states get real. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  Let's just stop trading between households. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=385.18s)]
*  Just you produce everything in your household. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  If this principle is true and it makes you rich to stop trading with others, I [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=389.62s)]
*  don't see what the limiting factor there is. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=394.22s)]
*  But regardless of that, one of the like when I'm having these thoughts and these [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=397.22s)]
*  conversations with friends and family of mine, I also recognize that I'm not in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=403.98s)]
*  the financial position that everybody's in. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=409.62s)]
*  Many people are not in the financial position I'm in. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=412.42s)]
*  And there's lots of good data on this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=415.18s)]
*  But if you look at the amount like since the lockdowns and the price inflation [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=416.82s)]
*  that followed the insane monetary policy of 2020, 2021, credit card debt [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=422.34s)]
*  skyrocketed like a lot of families are buying those dolls on the credit card. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=429.41999999999996s)]
*  Also, there are families that the difference won't be having 30 dolls or [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=436.5s)]
*  having to there's families that currently have to that the answer will be have zero, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=441.34s)]
*  which maybe would have been a better question for Kristen Walker to ask. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=446.14s)]
*  Like, how about that? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=450.02s)]
*  How about if it's the difference between now your kid doesn't get to play with a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=451.18s)]
*  doll? The other thing, and I'm sorry, but. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=454.3s)]
*  There is a good argument that like, you know, maybe we give our kids too many [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=458.62s)]
*  toys, maybe my house is filled with too much cheap toys that were made in China. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=464.26s)]
*  And maybe in general, kids would appreciate things more if they just had, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  you know, like we do have for people, at least in the situation, like a certain [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=473.42s)]
*  amount of abundance, we have more than we really need. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=477.66s)]
*  And there is to some degree, like a minimalist argument for what we're [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  like a minimalist argument for why, like you don't want to have too much more [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=486.18s)]
*  than you actually need of all of the people in the history of the world who [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=490.66s)]
*  have ever existed. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't know that there's one human being who is worse equipped to be the one [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=498.14000000000004s)]
*  making that argument than Donald fucking Trump. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry, Rob. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=508.3s)]
*  That is goddamn insane. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=509.54s)]
*  It is insane to spend your entire adult life being the poster child of capitalist [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=511.02s)]
*  excess to the point that you're going to, I'm going to take a shit on a gold [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=520.7s)]
*  plated toilet. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=525.06s)]
*  I'm going to live it up. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=526.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=528.06s)]
*  Like it's just for Donald Trump to be the one making the argument that people. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=528.78s)]
*  And like, again, it's just, I'm sorry. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=534.26s)]
*  I'm somebody who's driven by like principles and logic and just explain [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=537.54s)]
*  this to me then, like, if this is what you're saying, then wasn't price [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=543.98s)]
*  inflation actually a good thing? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=549.34s)]
*  Wasn't Joe Biden's economy actually good? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=552.22s)]
*  I mean, it forced you probably to get less things, you know, maybe that's nice. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=554.26s)]
*  Maybe you don't need all that stuff. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=559.22s)]
*  Maybe you should have less stuff. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=560.74s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=562.5s)]
*  I mean, this is just to me to try to sell this and not spin it as like, look, this [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=563.42s)]
*  is the cost. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=569.38s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=570.18s)]
*  These are the negatives that are associated with this policy. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=571.42s)]
*  But here's what I think the benefits are. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  But to spin this as this is a benefit and of all people for Donald Trump to be [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=575.54s)]
*  spinning, it's like, I'm sorry, I just can't defend this. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=580.74s)]
*  This is too ridiculous. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=583.9399999999999s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=585.78s)]
*  Well, I think that's a very funny observation. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=586.5799999999999s)]
*  I hadn't even thought about that of Trump preaching people on that they don't need [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=588.54s)]
*  to consume an excess. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=593.1800000000001s)]
*  My thought was a little bit different that, you know, Trump saying Trump picked a very [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=595.0200000000001s)]
*  good example here because when he says, hey, your kid will have three toys instead of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=599.4200000000001s)]
*  30, I think we can all go, oh, yeah, my kid needs to have less toys and there's an [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=603.1400000000001s)]
*  American job for him to have less toys. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=606.62s)]
*  Maybe that's a worthwhile tradeoff. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=608.62s)]
*  And so we picked a very good example for selling it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=611.0200000000001s)]
*  She asked a great first question. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=613.62s)]
*  She didn't write, ask the right follow up question, which is, are you acknowledging [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=615.34s)]
*  that prices are going to go up? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=618.26s)]
*  Because now what happens if prices are going up on things that aren't toys? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=619.9000000000001s)]
*  What if we're talking about not being able to buy a washer and dryer? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=623.82s)]
*  What if we're talking about not being able to buy clothes? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=626.5s)]
*  And then how much central planning do we want in our government? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=628.82s)]
*  Where are we going to figure out what goods are considered excess goods that the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=632.14s)]
*  government can decide we're going to put in tariffs on those? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=636.4200000000001s)]
*  And then there are going to be other favored industries that don't have the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=638.94s)]
*  tariffs because the government can understand, hey, you being able to consume [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=641.7800000000001s)]
*  this, such as a car, you need a car to get to work. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=645.46s)]
*  Right. Like maybe we could maybe we could break them down by essential and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=648.4200000000001s)]
*  non-essential goods. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=651.62s)]
*  Which already is kind of happening. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=655.1s)]
*  I read this article firstly is for car manufacturers, the increase in cost, I [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=657.7s)]
*  think, was expected to be six thousand dollars. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=664.1s)]
*  And so Trump temporarily has halted the tariffs on some base items such as like [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  steel. And so because General Motors was able to lobby the government and that it [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=672.58s)]
*  would affect their business, you know, their now preferred industry. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=676.74s)]
*  What about every small business owner that can't actually get Donald Trump's [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=680.26s)]
*  here and explain, hey, you didn't give me enough notice on this. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  You're ruining my business. I don't have enough time to make these adjustments. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=685.9000000000001s)]
*  And so to me, part of the tariff just speaks to do you want central planning in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=689.9000000000001s)]
*  the economy? Do you want the president to be able to say these are goods that you [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=695.34s)]
*  should not have in excess? So we're going to tariff them. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=698.9000000000001s)]
*  These are important goods or these are favored industries. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=701.6600000000001s)]
*  There's not going to be a tariff on it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=703.9000000000001s)]
*  And then what's going to be the fallout from the market versus central planning? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=705.58s)]
*  This is a president saying, hey, I don't think it's important for you to be able [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=709.74s)]
*  to consume blank amount of this item. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=712.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, the two that he wants to tell you about is pencils and dolls. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=715.5s)]
*  But what other items are you going to see price increases on? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=718.98s)]
*  Are those ones that will be vastly more detrimental to your lifestyle? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  And then what does he make an adjustment down the line? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=726.9s)]
*  Did he not foresee it? What does those adjustment periods look like? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=728.9s)]
*  This is all just the stupidity of central planning. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=732.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that's absolutely right. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=735.18s)]
*  And there is something like the point you're making is a really good one. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=737.26s)]
*  And there's something very frustrating about like [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=741.0600000000001s)]
*  constantly almost like like minimizing what the issue with rising prices is. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=745.78s)]
*  Like, you know, like you would think after living through the last few years [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=753.18s)]
*  of serious price inflation, that that would be gone, that it's like, yeah, dude, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=756.86s)]
*  this isn't just like, oh, yeah, you got to pay a couple more dollars [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=762.62s)]
*  for cheap Chinese garbage or something like that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=766.8199999999999s)]
*  It's like, what about really important items? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=769.62s)]
*  And there's always this is something that's always been frustrating to me. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=772.5799999999999s)]
*  As I've I've I've said this many times over the years. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=777.54s)]
*  And I really I'm very influenced by Hans Hermann Hoppe, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=781.0999999999999s)]
*  the great German libertarian theorist and economist. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=785.38s)]
*  But he always used to say [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=789.3s)]
*  that essentially like that libertarians needed to learn a conservative lesson [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=792.3399999999999s)]
*  and conservatives needed to learn a libertarian lesson. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=797.66s)]
*  And from my perspective, I think most good libertarians [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=800.9s)]
*  did learn that conservative lesson, which is like that there's something about like [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=806.14s)]
*  if you want to have a free society and you want to have a stable society, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=811.6199999999999s)]
*  and particularly if you want to have a libertarian society [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=814.8199999999999s)]
*  where the government isn't like hyper regulating social activity. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=817.18s)]
*  Well, then you've got to you've got to find other ways by which to promote [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=820.38s)]
*  social cohesion and normalcy. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=824.26s)]
*  And like you can't just have a nation of degeneracy. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=826.8199999999999s)]
*  That's not going to work out. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=829.34s)]
*  And that's kind of the conservative lesson that libertarians needed to learn. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=831.14s)]
*  But then there's like an economic lesson that conservatives need to learn, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=836.46s)]
*  but they just never seem to make any progress toward. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=840.58s)]
*  Maybe sometimes when the opposition party is in, they seem like they are. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=843.34s)]
*  But it's like things like this, like you if you want to say, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=847.14s)]
*  oh, rising prices is just you know what I mean? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=851.58s)]
*  That's just your kid having three dollars instead of thirty dollars or something like that. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=855.14s)]
*  It's like, listen, first of all, as I mentioned, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=859.34s)]
*  we've seen what rising prices did over the last few years. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=863.9s)]
*  There is no you can't remove these economic issues [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=866.86s)]
*  from like cultural issues, societal issues, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=871.9s)]
*  religious issues, all of that. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=875.98s)]
*  You know, it's I think it's right around the divorce rate is like right around 50 percent, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=878.02s)]
*  something like 50 percent of marriages end in divorce. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=884.5s)]
*  The number one reason for divorce is financial difficulties. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=887.78s)]
*  This is the number one thing that breaks families up. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=893.26s)]
*  This isn't just a question of like, is are your kids going to have thirty dollars or two dollars? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=896.5799999999999s)]
*  In fact, a lot of times it might be the question of whether your kids are going to have two parents. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=901.14s)]
*  Or not. It's not a game to just make life more expensive, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=905.9s)]
*  especially when so many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=910.8199999999999s)]
*  So many Americans are putting necessities on the credit card. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=914.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, like there's some of these studies where it's like, I mean, you could [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=918.98s)]
*  sometimes they manipulate the numbers and it's not exactly what it is, but it's still pretty close. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=923.18s)]
*  But like where they'll there'll be these things of like what percentage of an of Americans can come up [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=927.9s)]
*  with a thousand dollars for an emergency. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=933.1s)]
*  And it's like a shockingly high percentage of them can't. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=935.94s)]
*  And like, or, you know, sometimes like I've seen people nitpick these studies where I'll be like, well, they do have credit cards. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=939.3000000000001s)]
*  So like they could put it on the credit card if they needed to. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  But still, like it's still pretty wild. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=946.0600000000001s)]
*  And like the idea that we're going to embark on a policy that is going to make life harder for these people is not something [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=948.86s)]
*  it's not something that should be shrugged off any more than during lockdowns when they'd shrug off the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=956.7s)]
*  non-essential jobs. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=962.14s)]
*  Who cares about that job? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=963.86s)]
*  That's not essential. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=965.26s)]
*  Go look at the mental health results of that policy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=966.66s)]
*  It was it was not good. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=971.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Natalie pulled up one of them here. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=974.62s)]
*  It says most Americans can't afford a thousand dollar emergency expense report fines. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=977.18s)]
*  Now, I have seen I think there was something where people said like this didn't account for credit cards or something like [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=982.38s)]
*  that. But regardless, even if if you're if most Americans [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=987.42s)]
*  can't just come up with a thousand dollars with that, that's a really that that's that indicates something. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=992.0600000000001s)]
*  There's a real problem there. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=998.46s)]
*  And of course, there's a lot of government policies that have contributed to that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1000.0200000000001s)]
*  But I just like I will I will never be on the side of anybody, particularly people, you know, when it's a conversation [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1003.98s)]
*  between a billionaire and a multimillionaire, which is what you're watching here, this conversation between Donald Trump [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1014.1800000000001s)]
*  and and Kristen Walker. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1021.74s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, like you you both anytime. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1024.46s)]
*  Listen, I don't have money like either of them have money, but I'm doing well enough that if I were to ever talk about [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1029.38s)]
*  prices going up, I would always be like conscious of the fact that like, oh, there's a lot of people who that's a [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1035.42s)]
*  completely different situation for. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1041.9s)]
*  And like, yeah, it is kind of true that like if my coffee, my cup of coffee goes from like four dollars to six dollars, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1044.38s)]
*  it doesn't mean that much to me. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1050.98s)]
*  But I also know that there's like there's a whole lot of people out there who it's like, OK, well, I can't get coffee out [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1053.26s)]
*  now, if that's the case. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1058.06s)]
*  Like there's and it is, you know, the the what is it? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1059.9s)]
*  The average, the median salary, I think, is under sixty thousand dollars a year. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1064.06s)]
*  I think the median household income is under eighty thousand dollars a year. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1069.5s)]
*  And if you, you know, if you're in a situation where you're making around the average or or beneath the average salary, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1074.06s)]
*  this price is going up is a huge deal to you. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1081.54s)]
*  It's crushing. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1084.98s)]
*  It changes your trajectory of where you were going in life. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1086.46s)]
*  You're like, oh, shit, thought I was going to be comfortable for a second here. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1089.54s)]
*  Nope. I'm back to being totally screwed. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1092.5s)]
*  And, you know, I just think there's something really fucked up about rich people downplaying that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1094.98s)]
*  Like, that's an acceptable, you know, again, like I said, Donald Trump, of all people being like, no, it's acceptable that [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1100.78s)]
*  you'll be able to you'll be able to to have less stuff. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1106.98s)]
*  What is it? The median salary in US 2025 is about sixty one thousand dollars. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1113.26s)]
*  OK, did I say under 60? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1117.58s)]
*  OK, I was wrong. I guess it's a little over 60. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1119.34s)]
*  But still, I was pretty close. Yeah. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1121.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. Tariffs are bad economics. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1125.54s)]
*  If you want to make an argument that they can be used as a leveraging tool to get a better outcome. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1128.94s)]
*  OK, fine. But then your whole argument hinges on the outcome. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1133.8600000000001s)]
*  But the tariffs themselves are just a bad policy. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1138.3400000000001s)]
*  And for this reason, that raises prices and that makes life harder for middle class and working class people, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1141.1000000000001s)]
*  destroys poor people. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1148.46s)]
*  And, yeah, it doesn't matter that much to rich people. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1150.66s)]
*  That's the truth. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1153.46s)]

*  All right. Let's get back into the show. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1205.6999999999998s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1207.4199999999998s)]
*  OK. Anything else on the tariff talk or you want to switch gears here, Rob? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1209.4599999999998s)]
*  Let's switch gears. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1212.6999999999998s)]
*  OK. So I did. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1214.06s)]
*  I didn't want to make this an entire episode, but I did feel. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1216.54s)]
*  And for those of you who listen to the the members only episode this week, by the way, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1220.86s)]
*  we do record a fourth episode that is only for subscribing members. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1226.82s)]
*  But you got to sign up at part of part of the problem dot com in order to get that episode. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1230.42s)]
*  But so sometimes it goes like this where I'll figure something out on the members only episode. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1236.6599999999999s)]
*  And I'll be like, you know what? I didn't even want to say this on the show for everybody. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1243.7s)]
*  But I'll say it for you guys. And then as I'm saying it, I'm like, you know what? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1246.82s)]
*  I think I'm going to have to bring this up on Monday. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1249.8999999999999s)]
*  So you you guys who watch that episode, we may have have seen me develop these this thought a little bit. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1252.02s)]
*  But I do feel that I kind of have to respond to to Matt Walsh, who was on Tucker Carlson's show. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1258.34s)]
*  And they I ended up coming up for quite a bit of the conversation. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1268.18s)]
*  And what started it, of course, was they were talking about the debate with Douglas Murray. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1274.18s)]
*  We don't really have to get back into that. This has kind of been litigated to death. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1278.22s)]
*  But it was an interesting dynamic. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1281.38s)]
*  So here you have Tucker Carlson, who has let's say him and Ben Shapiro have been not seeing eye to eye. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1284.3s)]
*  For the last year and a half or so. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1297.3s)]
*  And now he's got Ben Shapiro's guy, his big number one guy over at at Daily Wire. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1299.34s)]
*  And the topic of, you know, Israel is coming up. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1308.06s)]
*  And it did. Again, much like I said, with when Jordan Peterson went on Rogan, I did appreciate that I thought. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1312.9399999999998s)]
*  I got it was like about as nice as I could expect somebody from the Daily Wire to speak about me. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1322.42s)]
*  There there was an interesting thing in this clip, and there's there's one part where look, I don't even know how to say it. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1332.26s)]
*  I can't like beat around the bush. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1341.02s)]
*  There is this strain of. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1343.94s)]
*  Kind of non interventionist types who do not wish to criticize Israel. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1348.66s)]
*  And I would say both Tim Poole and Matt Walsh fall into this category. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1358.3400000000001s)]
*  Now, full disclosure, I like Tim Poole and I like Matt Walsh. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1366.02s)]
*  I don't know Matt Walsh. I've never met him. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1370.26s)]
*  I have met Tim Poole many times and I liked him a lot. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1371.74s)]
*  And but I also like Matt, like I think Matt's an important voice. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1374.38s)]
*  I think his documentaries are good. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1378.02s)]
*  I think he's like he's been a very effective voice arguing against a lot of woke insanity. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1379.7s)]
*  He's a strong voice for like social conservatism. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1386.9s)]
*  And I think that's been particularly important over the last few years. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1390.98s)]
*  But both of them kind of take on this. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1396.14s)]
*  They have this tone and this line of reasoning whenever it comes to Israel specifically, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1398.66s)]
*  weirdly, not with other countries, but with Israel, where they will take the non interventionist position officially. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1407.5800000000002s)]
*  But then they will also kind of like mock people who they claim have Israel derangement syndrome. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1416.7s)]
*  They get fidgety and defensive in a way that they never would with other foreign countries. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1424.74s)]
*  And this is part of like what Matt Walsh is talking about in the episode. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1430.7s)]
*  It comes to a lot of this like, look, I don't care. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1435.26s)]
*  I'm an American. I don't care what's going on over there. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1438.34s)]
*  And just to be clear, I think that would be a completely reasonable position if the US government wasn't already involved in this. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1442.1399999999999s)]
*  But once we are, I think you kind of don't get to play that card anymore. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1454.02s)]
*  It's like on the level of like in 2006, sitting here and being like, I just don't care about Iraq. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1458.26s)]
*  Why is everyone so obsessed about what's going on in Fallujah? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1465.5s)]
*  I mean, who cares? This is America. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1469.5s)]
*  It's like, oh, OK, well, the reason why we're focusing on that right now is because our boys are dropping bombs on human beings over there right now. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1471.34s)]
*  Oh, and they're doing it for a bullshit reasons like they were lied into it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1479.78s)]
*  And likewise, when it comes to Israel today, it's like, listen, dude, if you're a non interventionist, well, we are intervening. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1484.26s)]
*  We are propping up this country. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1494.22s)]
*  This country is actively trying to get us more intervened in the region. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1496.1s)]
*  And so at a certain point, not criticizing them just comes off as cowardice. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1501.7s)]
*  Like, as I said to you on the members only stream, Rob, I have and I have always said this. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1507.9s)]
*  If you do not care about politics, I have no counter argument to that. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1514.18s)]
*  Like, if you're like, dude, I just don't care. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1521.6200000000001s)]
*  I want to tune out. I want to tune out. Tune off. Go live my life. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1523.66s)]
*  I don't want to focus on all this other stuff. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1527.5s)]
*  I have no argument to that. Fine. Then go do that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1529.5800000000002s)]
*  I focus on this stuff because it fascinates me. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1532.38s)]
*  If it doesn't fascinate you, then I completely understand it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1535.02s)]
*  But if you do this and you're a political commentator for a living and you also kind of brand yourself like the guy who I'll say the thing. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1539.86s)]
*  And I don't care about the flack that I get back from it. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1551.78s)]
*  I'll say it. It's like, OK, but you won't say this one. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1554.54s)]
*  You there's this one line. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1560.1000000000001s)]
*  And I understand you don't want to cross the line because there's a lot of flack that comes with it. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1561.5s)]
*  Like, OK, but then, like, I don't know, there's something I kind of can't respect you being this person. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1566.38s)]
*  Then, like, I think if you're if you're going to say that you're against all these wars and you're a non interventionist, then I don't know how that comes without being critical of Israel. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1572.22s)]
*  Now, you don't have to go down. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1585.54s)]
*  You don't have to be like a Jew hater. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1586.78s)]
*  You don't have to be deranged. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1588.5s)]
*  You don't have to make it something you focus a ton on. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1589.54s)]
*  But it is on the level of being like, look, I'm. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1592.3s)]
*  It's like you're sitting in 2004 and you're like, I'm a non interventionist. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1597.06s)]
*  I don't believe America should fight wars that we don't have to be involved in. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1600.5s)]
*  I don't think we should do nation building or democracy promotion or occupying foreign countries. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1603.78s)]
*  I don't believe in any of that. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1609.9s)]
*  And I'd be like, I know, right. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1611.3s)]
*  That's why I can't stand Bush and Cheney. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1612.74s)]
*  And they'd be like, what's with the obsession with Bush and Cheney, dude? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1614.58s)]
*  Like, I don't even care about them. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1617.86s)]
*  They're in Washington, D.C. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1619.54s)]
*  And I live out here in Alabama. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1621.02s)]
*  Like, I don't care. That's the whole it's like, oh, no, come on. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1622.6599999999999s)]
*  Like, let's just be real here. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1626.6999999999998s)]
*  Take this to its logical conclusion that I'm not even saying you don't have to obsessively hate Cheney and Bush. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1628.1399999999999s)]
*  But if I ask you have to go like, yeah, I don't like the those guys are wrong. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1633.4599999999998s)]
*  I don't know. And there was something about this which was so like, I don't know, dude. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1638.02s)]
*  It's like Matt Walsh has all the balls in the world. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1642.1399999999999s)]
*  When it comes to calling out gender theory, you know, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1646.1799999999998s)]
*  but then like I'm just watching how uncomfortable he is in this Tucker interview, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1650.3799999999999s)]
*  when Tucker's asking them specific questions. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1656.1799999999998s)]
*  And I just found it interesting. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1658.5s)]
*  And then he did at one point in the debate, he tried to insist that Douglas had made one really good point. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1660.06s)]
*  That's the clip that we're about to play. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1667.5s)]
*  And then we'll we'll respond to that. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1669.3799999999999s)]
*  But any any thoughts on any of this stuff, Rob? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1671.1s)]
*  Well, I think you said it during the Iraq war, you weren't criticizing what we're doing. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1673.1s)]
*  Like, you know, we spend way too much money over in Israel. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1678.34s)]
*  Their lobby is a little bit too advanced and good at strong arming our government [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1681.6599999999999s)]
*  and making sure that they continue to have their support. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1686.8999999999999s)]
*  And so if you're America first, and you don't like foreign aid, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1689.26s)]
*  and you don't like other countries intervening in our government and managing to get a lot of aid, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1692.62s)]
*  well, then Israel is probably on top of the list of people that you'd want to criticize. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1697.1s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm just saying if you totally believe, hey, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1701.26s)]
*  we don't need to be sending and propping up other countries and spending our money abroad or being involved in these messes. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1704.66s)]
*  If you want to look at the current world environment and what the most egregious actors are of people who are getting our money, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1710.26s)]
*  I guess you'd be opposing Ukraine right now and you'd be opposing Israel. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1716.3799999999999s)]
*  And if you do a daily show or a pretty frequent show where you're commenting on things going on in the news [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1719.74s)]
*  and you don't like our money being spent in those places, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1724.54s)]
*  why don't you think that's a good way to do it? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1726.66s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1729.18s)]
*  And believe me, there's a lot of things I wish we didn't have to focus on. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1730.18s)]
*  Almost everything I focus on, I wish we didn't have to focus on. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1734.18s)]
*  Like, I don't think there should be... [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1738.18s)]
*  I wish I could have just gone to work during COVID. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1741.18s)]
*  Yeah, right, exactly. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1743.18s)]
*  I wouldn't have had to talk about it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1744.18s)]
*  We wouldn't have had to spend any time talking about lockdowns if the government hadn't instituted lockdowns. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1746.18s)]
*  But the thing is that they did. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1753.18s)]
*  And so then just not talking about it isn't really an option unless you're going to leave this space altogether. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1755.18s)]
*  Unless you're just going to... [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1762.18s)]
*  Unless you're going to be that guy who goes, I'm not interested, I'm tuning out, I'm focusing on my own life. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1763.18s)]
*  If you are, more power to you. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1768.18s)]
*  If you're not and you're staying in this, like, I'm going to be a political commentator through the year 2020, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1770.18s)]
*  you got to have something to say about it. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1775.18s)]
*  For it or against it. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1777.18s)]
*  You can't be indifferent. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1778.18s)]
*  It's too big of a deal. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1779.18s)]
*  Okay, let's jump in to the clip here where Tucker asks Matt Walsh a very pointed question. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1781.18s)]
*  And notice, see, by the way, if you think I'm like, I don't think I'm like inferring something that's not there, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1788.18s)]
*  just right away, pay attention to how the reaction. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1793.18s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1798.18s)]
*  I think it was interesting. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1799.18s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1801.18s)]
*  I really did. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1802.18s)]
*  And I thought they both made valid points. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1803.18s)]
*  They both know more about the subject than I do, a lot more. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1805.18s)]
*  That was very clear to me. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1808.18s)]
*  And I think he could chop off the first hour of the debate. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1809.18s)]
*  It was an interesting conversation. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1813.18s)]
*  Who do you think made a more compelling case on the matter once they actually got down to the question at hand? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1815.18s)]
*  I think it was a very interesting conversation. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1821.18s)]
*  Who do you think made a more compelling case on the matter once they actually got down to the question at hand? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1824.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1839.18s)]
*  I think that... [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1840.18s)]
*  It's just you can watch him going like, all right, there's the correct answer. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1846.18s)]
*  There's what Ben Shapiro will say about this. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1851.18s)]
*  I mean, it was literally that I've never seen a moment like that other than when I asked Bobby Kennedy if he thought Israel had too much influence on American politics. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1855.18s)]
*  And it's just this like long pause of like weighing out every so careful. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1863.18s)]
*  Just answer it, Matt. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1869.18s)]
*  Like, what is a woman? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1870.18s)]
*  Just answer the question, dude. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1871.18s)]
*  It's a real simple one. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1873.18s)]
*  You know, I mean, look, he went on a whole thing before this about how Douglas just basically made this whole nonsense experts argument and all that. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1874.18s)]
*  But like, anyway, OK, so now he's trying to figure out how is there a way that you can say Douglas Murray made some point or something like that? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1880.18s)]
*  So here's what he's got. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1888.18s)]
*  And one thing he made one point that I thought was was really good. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1890.18s)]
*  It was just a simple one. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1895.18s)]
*  I like simple points. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1897.18s)]
*  Me too. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1898.18s)]
*  And at one point he asked Dave because once they got into arguing about what happened after October 7th, how Israel responded, they were like, OK, we're going to go with this. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1899.18s)]
*  And then he went on to argue with how Israel responded. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1909.18s)]
*  And Dave has all of his criticisms about what Israel has done. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1912.18s)]
*  And then Douglas Murray said, said, well, what would you what would you have them do? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1917.18s)]
*  What would you prefer to have for them to have done? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1924.18s)]
*  If they want to rescue the hostages and also destroy Hamas? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1928.18s)]
*  What do you want them to do instead? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1933.18s)]
*  And then from I remember, Dave, he pointed out that, OK, destroying Hamas and rescuing hostages are kind of are not necessarily the same objective. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1936.18s)]
*  And then they started talking about rescuing hostages. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1944.18s)]
*  They didn't really circle back to the destroying Hamas part. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1947.18s)]
*  I would have liked to see him stick on that point. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1951.18s)]
*  Like, get an answer. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1955.18s)]
*  So if you're Israel, you have a foreign, you know, these foreign enemy that's come into your country, slaughtered hundreds of people. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1956.18s)]
*  What should how should you respond to that? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1966.18s)]
*  And I think he should have he should have pressed that and he didn't. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1972.18s)]
*  And so it became sort of unfocused because I would have I would legitimately like to hear the answer to that. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1977.18s)]
*  For sure. What what would you have them do? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1984.18s)]
*  So we could talk about maybe there are other ways to rescue the hostages. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1987.18s)]
*  But do you think they should try to destroy Hamas given what happened? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1990.18s)]
*  And if you do, how else should they go about it? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=1995.18s)]
*  But they kind of moved on to other things and it became this kind of it became a sort of unfocused in my mind, sort of like circular conversation, as these debates tend to devolve into very often. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2002.18s)]
*  If you were in control of what people on Twitter debated, what would you think? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2013.18s)]
*  Let's pause it here. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2017.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2018.18s)]
*  So, you know, really, the thing that kind of got this response out of me was that Matt Walsh very specifically asked, like, I would like to hear the answer to this question. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2021.18s)]
*  So let's try. I mean, I've given this a thousand times, but why not? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2031.18s)]
*  Let's give it again. No matter how many times I say this, there will always be people who go, Dave never offers a real solution. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2035.18s)]
*  He never offers an alternative. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2041.18s)]
*  If I'm being completely honest, I don't even remember being asked for this in the debate. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2043.18s)]
*  But the debate went in so many different directions. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2047.18s)]
*  I do. I got a start, though, by saying, I think it's kind of funny that after this most pregnant of pauses, Matt Walsh comes up with, you know, Douglas Murray did make one really great point. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2050.1800000000003s)]
*  It was a simple point. And I like a simple point. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2063.1800000000003s)]
*  And then never gave a point. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2065.1800000000003s)]
*  It seems that he asked a question like a question isn't a point. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2068.18s)]
*  It's a question. And like if he had pushed me on this question, I certainly would have been happy to give my answer. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2072.18s)]
*  I don't remember. Did I give this answer a little bit on the thing? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2078.18s)]
*  But regardless, I mean, getting into it, it's like, OK, I don't know. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2080.18s)]
*  He didn't give a point that Douglas Murray made. It was just a question. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2084.18s)]
*  Listen, as I said, as Matt Walsh repeated, there these are separate goals. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2088.18s)]
*  If the goal is retrieve the hostages and the goal is destroy Hamas, those are two different things that you're trying to accomplish. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2093.18s)]
*  Now, you could say you're trying to accomplish both of those things. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2102.18s)]
*  But if you're asking how to accomplish them, just understand that those are two different goals, which might actually be in conflict with each other. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2104.18s)]
*  Like, OK, if you want to now look, I'm not saying just to disclaimer this, I'm not saying that Hamas can be trusted or that they come through on their word or anything like that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2112.18s)]
*  But the truth is that the best way to get hostages back and this is not just something that we know because we can deduce it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2125.18s)]
*  But we know it because we can deduce it. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2137.18s)]
*  But we also know this is the way that's been most effective for Israel retrieving the hostages that they've gotten back is negotiating. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2139.18s)]
*  That's how they got just during the first phase of that ceasefire, which never even made it to phase two that Wittkopf, Trump's envoy negotiated shortly after Trump won the election. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2148.18s)]
*  Israel got like 30 hostages back by negotiating with Hamas. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2160.18s)]
*  As of I believe it was October 10th of 2023, Hamas offered a deal where they'd return all of the hostages. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2164.18s)]
*  Now, it was, you know, in exchange for some things they wanted. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2173.18s)]
*  Israel may have felt that some of those demands were unreasonable. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2175.18s)]
*  But the truth is, if your number one priority is getting back the hostages, then you try to negotiate for those hostages back. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2178.18s)]
*  And I would argue that I do think that is what any government's number one priority should be if they have hostages, their citizens taken into another country. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2188.18s)]
*  And by the way, I would definitely say seeing as how there was at least one Israeli with US citizenship who was a hostage, it should 100 percent be the US government's number one priority to get the hostages back. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2196.18s)]
*  I don't think it's too wild for most people to understand that if your number one goal is retrieving hostages, what you're not going to want to do is level the place. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2210.18s)]
*  That seems to be inconsistent with the goal of getting the hostages out. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2225.18s)]
*  And in fact, some of the only Israelis who have been loud protesters of this war have been the family of hostages because they're like, you know, what are you doing? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2229.18s)]
*  You're leveling the place where like our daughter is, you know, you can imagine how infuriating that would be. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2239.18s)]
*  But so that's the first part of all of this. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2246.18s)]
*  The second part is that and I think I did very specifically say this in the debate. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2250.18s)]
*  It's like, look, let me say, OK, a couple things here and you can jump in any time you want to, Rob. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2257.18s)]
*  But there's a couple things here. Number one, I do. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2262.18s)]
*  It does bug me a little bit if you're opposed to something when people will say, well, what's your plan? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2266.18s)]
*  Because you don't actually have to have a substitute plan to say like something is egregiously wrong. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2274.18s)]
*  I could give you a substitute plan, but you don't actually have to have that. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2279.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like if you if you see somebody like, you know, I don't know, their their kid isn't listening to them. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2283.18s)]
*  And so they just kick their kid in the face and knock them unconscious. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2290.18s)]
*  You could be like, whoa, that's horrible. That's no way to respond to your kid not listening to you. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2294.18s)]
*  And then someone goes like, well, what's your plan for what you do when they're not listening to you? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2299.18s)]
*  It's not actually incumbent on you to have an alternative plan in order to say this one is morally unacceptable. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2303.18s)]
*  So that's kind of first. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2310.18s)]
*  And if we're having a debate about Israel's response to this and someone is taking the position that what they're doing is morally unacceptable, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2312.18s)]
*  the onus is not on that person to have an alternative plan. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2319.18s)]
*  So first of all, that's like a bullshit cop out response. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2322.18s)]
*  However, the plan is fairly, fairly obvious what Israel should have done after October 7th, right? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2326.18s)]
*  Which is that number one, there should have been a real like immediately what they should have done is ramped up border security and started negotiating to get the hostages back. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2333.18s)]
*  Take whatever deal you can to get these people back. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2345.18s)]
*  Nothing's more important than precious, innocent life being held in captivity. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2348.18s)]
*  By the way. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Brunt. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2353.18s)]
*  Choosing work boots used to mean sacrificing comfort or durability. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2359.18s)]
*  If they felt good, they didn't last. And if they lasted, they wrecked your feet. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2363.18s)]
*  Brunt Workwear finally ended that trade off designing boots that withstand the toughest job sites while feeling as comfortable as your favorite sneakers. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2367.18s)]
*  These might be the most comfortable work boots on the planet, but they also deliver real performance on the job. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2377.18s)]
*  Whether you need waterproof safety toe or soft toe, pull on or lace up. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2382.18s)]
*  They've got you covered. They're so confident that these boots will blow you away that they'll even let you try it on the job risk free. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2387.18s)]

*  I can tell you I already got a pair of them. They're incredibly comfortable. They're great work boots. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2415.18s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2438.18s)]
*  So, OK, so that's number one. Have a real open, transparent investigation into what the hell happened on October 7th and tell the truth. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2441.18s)]
*  Don't go around spreading all types of like horror propaganda, trying to make October 7 seem worse than it was. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2450.18s)]
*  What really were the failures here? And if you had that, what they would have come up with is that the Netanyahu government embarked on an explicit policy of propping up this ruthless terrorist organization so that they could deny the Palestinian people a state. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2458.18s)]
*  And then they totally underestimated the threat of Hamas. They thought they could control the height of the flame. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2474.18s)]
*  Turns out they weren't able to. So what you'd want to do rather than not protecting your border and propping up a terrorist organization right next door, stop doing both of those things. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2482.18s)]
*  Protect your borders and stop propping up Hamas. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2494.18s)]
*  After that, I think like, look, I've never suggested that Israel was supposed to respond to October 7th with zero violence and that there would be zero. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2499.18s)]
*  I don't think it's practical to expect just about any government to have a response that involves zero violence. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2511.18s)]
*  However, Israel had a long history of dealing with the terrorism problem through targeted assassinations and special operations and intelligence operations. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2517.18s)]
*  They never treated the terrorism problem amongst Palestinians as a problem for the regular old army. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2528.18s)]
*  Just bomb cities. That was never how it worked until Benjamin Netanyahu came into power. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2535.18s)]
*  And so, yeah, I would argue that Israel had an opportunity, as I've made this point before. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2540.18s)]
*  I know sometimes people think this is a little like like hippie ish or something like that. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2546.18s)]
*  But I don't think it is. And if you if you recall after 9 11 after after 9 11, they had these huge candlelight vigils for the victims of 9 11 in Tehran across the Muslim world. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2551.18s)]
*  There were lots of people who felt terrible for America. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2569.18s)]
*  And if we had. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2572.18s)]
*  Just fought the war on terrorism with special operations forces, as we did in the months following 9 11, which is what took out most of the Al Qaeda cells in Afghanistan. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2576.18s)]
*  And if we had done that and then caught Osama bin Laden and Tora Bora and then wrapped up the whole thing by New Year's Eve of 2001, we could have maintained the moral high ground in that. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2586.18s)]
*  But instead, we launched multiple 20 year occupations and killed hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2598.18s)]
*  And then we were left with instead of a few hundred bin Laden nights, tens of thousands of them and hatred across the Muslim world. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2604.18s)]
*  And Israel could have like everything you see about global opinion turning on Israel didn't have to be this way. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2611.18s)]
*  Israel could have taken this opportunity to go like, look, we're going to have this transparent investigation. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2618.18s)]
*  We're going to admit that we made a huge mistake by propping up this terrorist group so that we would never have to give Palestinians their independence. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2624.18s)]
*  And we could have said right now we're going to do that. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2631.18s)]
*  We're going to take our boot off the neck. We're going to end the blockade. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2634.18s)]
*  We're going to end the occupation. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2637.18s)]
*  But we're not doing that unless we get our hostages back. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2638.18s)]
*  And if there are any more rockets coming in, then we're going to do X, Y and Z. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2640.18s)]
*  We're going to make sure that we let the world know that we do value Palestinian life and we'll make sure we're not going to kill an unnecessary amount of people. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2644.18s)]
*  Like, again, I'm just spitballing here. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2653.18s)]
*  I'm not a fucking expert, but there were alternatives where Israel didn't convince the world that they were the monsters that the world is seeing right now. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2656.18s)]
*  So, no, I don't think the onus is on. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2665.18s)]
*  I don't think that it certainly wasn't a good point that Douglas made. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2667.18s)]
*  It wasn't a point at all. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2671.18s)]
*  It was a question. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2672.18s)]
*  But honestly, I don't think the onus is on me to have the answer to that question. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2673.18s)]
*  But the answer I just gave is much better than what they did. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2677.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2680.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2681.18s)]
*  Anything else you want to add to that, Rob? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2682.18s)]
*  Well, in regards to not having to answer that question, Douglas Murray refused to answer for why is Israel justified in killing kids and civilians? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2684.18s)]
*  And he mostly lied and said they have not. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2692.18s)]
*  It's most of the damage that you've witnessed was booby trapping done by Gaza. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2694.18s)]
*  And then, of course, they always like to say Israel doesn't target. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2699.18s)]
*  Well, they seem to hate a lot of it. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2702.18s)]
*  So I don't know what that means when you keep going. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2704.18s)]
*  Well, it's not our intention. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2706.18s)]
*  Well, if you explode a building with kids in it, it might not be your intention to kill all the kids in it. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2707.18s)]
*  But it's your intention product of what you're doing. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2712.18s)]
*  So it doesn't really help to say it's not our intention. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2715.18s)]
*  But speaking to, you know, go after the leadership. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2718.18s)]
*  There's money. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2721.18s)]
*  There's influence. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2722.18s)]
*  There's people who are making money off of what's going on over there. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2723.18s)]
*  And they quite specifically, while taking food aid, decided to continue to send money, which is the most fungible of all goods. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2726.18s)]
*  So, you know, if every single item that goes into Gaza can't go in there because it can be used as a weapon, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2733.18s)]
*  if someone can explain how money can't then be converted into weapons through the tunnel, oh, the tunnels with Egypt. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2738.18s)]
*  Well, my guess is the money is what helps those operate at the highest capacity and is what actually makes the most amount of weaponry available. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2745.18s)]
*  I don't think it's I don't think it's the food that you send in. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2753.18s)]
*  And I think that Israel has not taken the opportunity to go after whatever leadership of Hamas exists in Qatar. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2757.18s)]
*  I don't know. People want to say that that's a different branch of it. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2766.18s)]
*  Someone's making money here. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2769.18s)]
*  And I bet if you turned off that money and all actually offered some incentives for peace, you might have some opportunities there. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2770.18s)]
*  But as you said, the framework to me appears to be Israel trying to do everything they can so that they have people that they don't have to offer a stay to. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2778.18s)]
*  And that they have got no choice but to murder. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2786.18s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny, too, to see. Yeah, I completely agree with you. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2789.18s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. The potatoes are dual use, Rob. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2793.18s)]
*  And so we can't let those in. But suitcases of cash to Hamas that could only have one use, I guess that could only be used for aid anyway. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2796.18s)]
*  But it's like to hear Matt Walsh of all people kind of going like, you know, it's like, why even is it such a good point to ask? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2808.18s)]
*  Well, then how do you get rid of Hamas? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2818.18s)]
*  Like, how about if you got to if you got to murder tens of thousands of innocent children, then you don't then you don't get rid of Hamas. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2820.18s)]
*  Like, then you hear here's a principle for Matt Walsh, which will be tough, I'm sure, for him to figure. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2828.18s)]
*  But let's say I I had this principle that's that's against murdering children. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2834.18s)]
*  So it might be hard for you to think of. Let's call it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2840.18s)]
*  Let's call the position pro life. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2842.18s)]
*  OK, which, you know, imagine you were a pro lifer who was against murdering innocent children. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2845.18s)]
*  And then I were to say to you like, you know, you made this really good case being against, you know, abortion. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2852.18s)]
*  But, you know, the really good question is like, so then what do you do? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2862.18s)]
*  You know, what do you and then I think you realize right away that's actually not a hole in the pro life argument. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2867.18s)]
*  It's not a hole in the pro life argument to be like, but you haven't spelled out what that pregnant teenager should do. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2873.18s)]
*  And like, look, at some point, as most pro lifers do, they probably do what I just did, which is like offer some other. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2879.18s)]
*  Oh, you can give the baby up for adoption or maybe there'll be some social services or maybe there'll be this or that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2884.18s)]
*  Or maybe you should not have protected unprotected sex or maybe whatever. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2889.18s)]
*  But like you could have the principle that it's wrong to murder a baby and you don't actually have to have any more than that. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2893.18s)]
*  And we do this all the time where we say like, no, I'm sorry. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2901.18s)]
*  For moral reasons, that solution ought to be off the table. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2905.18s)]
*  And it's not incumbent on you to then have all of the other answers necessarily. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2910.18s)]
*  And it's weird how like the standard is the standard on me or whatever is that I must have all of the answers to this. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2917.18s)]
*  But you don't even have to criticize the government that's trying to get us into a war with Iran explicitly. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2925.18s)]
*  It's literally drew up war plans with us involved in them and is still working and has been working, has been working for many, many years. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2932.18s)]
*  Again, this is not I'm not alleging some secret conspiracy here. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2941.18s)]
*  I'm saying like Benjamin Netanyahu testified before Congress and urged the U.S. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2944.18s)]
*  government to overthrow the Iranian government. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2949.18s)]
*  Back in 2002, and he's been arguing for it the entire way since, including this week. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2952.18s)]
*  So, OK, here, let's let's keep playing because I think there was one more interesting part here. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2960.18s)]
*  Circular conversation. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2971.18s)]
*  As these debates tend to devolve into very often. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2973.18s)]
*  If you were in control of what people on Twitter debated, what would they be debating right now? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2976.18s)]
*  Everything we talked about for the first hour of this conversation is what like let's talk about the war on the family. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2986.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2994.18s)]
*  On marriage. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2995.18s)]
*  Things that affect our kids. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=2997.18s)]
*  You know, how do we how do we raise healthy, happy kids? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3000.18s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3004.18s)]
*  Any of these issues is like serious, deep cultural issues in our country. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3006.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3011.18s)]
*  Is what we should be talking about in my mind. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3012.18s)]
*  You feel like it's very hard to go from a to less. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3015.18s)]
*  You know, that's yeah, we could we could turn it off. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3020.18s)]
*  That was really the part of what again. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3022.18s)]
*  I'm I care about all of those issues that Matt Wells just mentioned. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3025.18s)]
*  And I think almost like the angle he was coming at it from because he said at one point, like the thing about how there's these like concentric circles. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3030.18s)]
*  You know, I care about my kids more than I care about any other kids. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3038.18s)]
*  Then I care about my friends, my family's kids. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3041.18s)]
*  Then I care about my my neighborhood. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3044.18s)]
*  Then I care about my city. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3046.18s)]
*  Then I care about my state. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3047.18s)]
*  Then I care about my nation. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3048.18s)]
*  And like, I certainly get that. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3050.18s)]
*  I don't disagree with that at all. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3052.18s)]
*  I feel the same way, just like the moral calculation changes a little bit when your government is funding the intentional murder of a bunch of children. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3054.18s)]
*  It just changes the moral calculation. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3066.18s)]
*  Like I'm not, you know, I don't like we care. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3068.18s)]
*  We all care. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3073.18s)]
*  You know, you don't want to see anyone get mistreated. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3074.18s)]
*  But of course, we all care about our own first. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3077.18s)]
*  That's just part of humanity. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3080.18s)]
*  And I can't like I don't I don't like that. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3082.18s)]
*  There's homeless people. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3084.18s)]
*  But like I care. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3085.18s)]
*  I care much more if my kid like skin their knee than I do about some homeless person. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3087.18s)]
*  It's just that that's the truth. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3093.18s)]
*  But like if I was driving in a car full of my family and like one of my family members got out and then just murdered a bunch of homeless people and then got back in the car, I'm not going to sit there and be like, why is everyone talking about these homeless people? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3096.18s)]
*  I mean, like my kids skin their knee at school today, you know, like you'd be like, oh, shoot. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3111.18s)]
*  No, now we got to talk about that because you just can't do that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3116.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3121.18s)]
*  And particularly when I'm being forced to fund it, I'm going to have a problem with it. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3122.18s)]
*  So, you know, unless unless the social conservatives want to abandon the pro-life position, I'd say that like you kind of have to acknowledge that us. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3126.18s)]
*  Funding kids being killed is a bit of a moral issue that it's kind of incumbent on all of us to care about. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3139.18s)]
*  And I also don't think, you know, I don't think these things are as unrelated as you think. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3147.18s)]
*  I mean, if you want to talk about like the policies that have been bad for kids and bad for families, you know, a whole lot of families have been broken up by these wars over the last 25 years. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3151.18s)]
*  Tens of thousands of our young guys have have committed suicide in the aftermath of the wars. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3165.18s)]
*  These are the kids who now will grow up without fathers or these are young men who will never have kids who they may have gone on to. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3175.18s)]
*  Not to mention the, you know, the 10 trillion dollars we've spent over the last 25 years on all this shit that has put quite a bit of pressure on families. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3186.18s)]
*  As I got back to what I said before, financial stress being the number one cause of divorce. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3196.18s)]
*  Well, there's we had to print a whole lot of money to make up that that 10 trillion dollars. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3200.18s)]
*  And that's that's done quite a bit to hurt the purchasing power of families. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3205.18s)]
*  So again, I just don't think these issues are nearly as separate as people make them out to be. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3212.18s)]
*  But also then, you know, on on a moral level, I do just think that at least the way I look at it, there's you know, I've I've taken a lot of flack for the position that I've taken on Israel. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3218.18s)]
*  And, you know, like whatever, I took a lot of flack for my position on covid and Ukraine and other things, too. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3235.18s)]
*  But I've taken a lot of flack for this one. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3242.18s)]
*  And in many ways, especially at this point in my career, things are going pretty good for me. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3244.18s)]
*  It might be a little bit easier for me to just not talk about this. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3250.18s)]
*  I could have that same position be like, I'm vaguely non interventionist. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3254.18s)]
*  I don't really want to talk about this. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3257.18s)]
*  But I'll tell you, like. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3259.18s)]
*  I have I have a son and I mean, I have a daughter, too, but this it affects me more thinking about my son. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3262.18s)]
*  But like. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3270.18s)]
*  At some point, he's going to grow up and he's going to know what I did with my life. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3271.18s)]
*  And he'll know that I was like a person in this space, a political commentator that had a show with hundreds of thousands of people who regularly go to the movies. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3277.18s)]
*  People who regularly goes on shows with millions of people. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3288.18s)]
*  And the idea that while this was going on, like for my son to know that while this was going on, I didn't speak out against it because it it was a little bit easier for me or something like that. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3291.18s)]
*  I don't know. Like my my attitude as a father of a little boy is that like nothing, nothing scares me more than that. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3308.18s)]
*  More than ever, like having your son look at you and go like, you know, the worst thing in the world was going on and you were funding it and you didn't like say anything about that. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3317.18s)]
*  You didn't want to speak out because it was going to what? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3330.18s)]
*  Like some people might say mean stuff about you as a response. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3333.18s)]
*  You know, to me, that's like it's kind of all related. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3338.18s)]
*  I'm not saying it's exactly the same thing, but there's something there is a relationship there between like the evil foreign policy and our own collective soul as a nation. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3342.18s)]

*  Let's get back into the show. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3457.18s)]
*  So, yeah, anyway, I don't know. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3459.18s)]
*  Anything else to add to that rub? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3461.18s)]
*  No, let's talk about this hero at the park. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3463.18s)]
*  Oh, shit. Okay. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3467.18s)]
*  You want to talk about that a little bit? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3468.18s)]
*  Sure. We can do that kind of quickly at the end. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3469.18s)]
*  So this is a big this is a big story. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3471.18s)]
*  It's a it's a sad story all around. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3474.18s)]
*  It's a sad state of affairs. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3478.18s)]
*  But so, yeah, I mean, I guess people have seen so this is blowing up is a really huge phenomenon of a story. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3480.18s)]
*  So evidently now this isn't all on video, but evidently a woman at a playground called like a little black boy, the N word. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3489.18s)]
*  And then someone else rushes up. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3499.18s)]
*  What's the camera interface? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3501.18s)]
*  Supposedly the child that she said that to was autistic and also going through her child's like diaper bag or, you know, some something that belonged to them. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3503.18s)]
*  Sure. Who knows. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3513.18s)]
*  But let's let's just assume for the sake of argument that that's the story. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3515.18s)]
*  So a guy comes up, puts a camera in her face like, did you just call this child the N word? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3519.18s)]
*  She's like, yeah, fuck you. I did. Blah, blah, blah. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3524.18s)]
*  She has a whole thing. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3526.18s)]
*  She drops it a few more times in the in the video. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3527.18s)]
*  And then, of course, the video is posted as a like, I'm going to ruin this chick's life type post. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3531.18s)]
*  She puts up a go fund me or something to raise money. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3539.18s)]
*  And last I saw she was over half a million dollars. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3542.18s)]
*  She had started, I think, asking for ten grand and then just kept upping the goal because money kept pouring in. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3545.18s)]
*  And now she's at like over half a million dollars. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3552.18s)]
*  And there, you know, of course, as you could imagine, you've got people on the left are going like, see, my God, this is proof. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3555.18s)]
*  Tax that you're you're saying the N word in the park collections. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3564.18s)]
*  That is the government. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3569.18s)]
*  Did they want to cut it? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3571.18s)]
*  Of course I did. I didn't report my my N word park money. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3573.18s)]
*  You tell me that's not deductible. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3576.18s)]
*  That's a crazy thing for the government to take its cut of. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3578.18s)]
*  Well, it does. It seems to me that there's there's an interesting thing going on here. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3582.18s)]
*  And I do think it's, you know, it's important when you see something something like this is like it's information about our culture. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3589.18s)]
*  You know, it's like letting you know, like, this is where you are right now. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3599.18s)]
*  And I think when you get that type of information, what you should try to do is assess it as rationally as you can. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3603.18s)]
*  And like what I'm seeing, because, of course, a lot of people will go, well, look, this is proof that we're in like a white supremacist country or something like that. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3611.18s)]
*  Now, I will say, don't get me wrong, I do find the thing kind of disturbing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3620.18s)]
*  I think it's disturbing for a lot of reasons. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3626.18s)]
*  And I don't actually think, you know, you should be using that word and certainly not towards kids at a park. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3629.18s)]
*  Yes, I don't think you should. I don't think you should use like any derogatory language or curses toward a child. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3635.18s)]
*  It's like totally fucking horrible. And, you know, like I have little kids. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3644.18s)]
*  I know about the playground rules. I even know about other kids being problems at the playgrounds. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3649.18s)]
*  But like, that's not an option. Like, you just can't do that. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3653.18s)]
*  And I certainly would never send money to somebody who had just called a little black child the N word that I would feel like sickened by that. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3657.18s)]
*  I do understand what's going on, though. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3670.18s)]
*  And I think that a lot of it is that. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3673.18s)]
*  Look, white people are especially young white people are starting to play this game now, too. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3677.18s)]
*  And it's a it's a sad thing to see. But there is to look. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3687.18s)]
*  This has been going on for a long time. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3693.18s)]
*  And it's been true in the black community for a long time where they will defend their own. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3695.18s)]
*  And it does not matter. It does. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3700.18s)]
*  Whatever. There was this kid who just raised something like five hundred thousand dollars himself who seemingly I don't know if he murdered this guy or not. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3703.18s)]
*  I guess maybe they're going to go to trial. But like the guy who stabbed the kid in the chest and killed him. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3711.18s)]
*  Well, he just killed a white kid. And then he gets all this money. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3715.18s)]
*  And it's just and of course, his lawyers and the civil rights activists around him will all make it a race issue. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3718.18s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether Michael Brown attacked a cop or Trayvon Martin attacked a neighborhood watch guy or whoever. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3724.18s)]
*  They're going to say this guy was a gentle giant. He was an angel. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3732.18s)]
*  Look, the OJ Simpson jury was the whole thing came down to all the black people voted not guilty for him. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3735.18s)]
*  And half of them didn't even care whether he did it or not. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3742.18s)]
*  And there also is another dynamic where, like, look, I don't obviously you should never you shouldn't be calling anyone the N word. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3745.18s)]
*  You should never be calling a child the N word. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3753.18s)]
*  But there is something where, like, when you stick a camera in someone's face and goad them into saying the N word and then post it online, you're attempting to ruin that person's life. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3756.18s)]
*  And I think what you've seen from this is like it's white people going, OK, then we're going to play that game, too. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3767.18s)]
*  Like you if you go on social media, you could see videos all day long of like black teenagers beating the crap out of some white kid. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3777.18s)]
*  And that doesn't ruin their life. You know, but like a white person saying the wrong word will ruin their life. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3785.18s)]
*  And I think at a certain point, there's it's just it's hit a point where like white people are not in larger numbers are just not willing to play that game anymore. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3793.18s)]
*  They're not willing to say the thing that like everybody else gets to act in their group interest, except for us. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3802.18s)]
*  Now, I do think a much a much more preferable answer to that would be like, let's all stop doing that. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3809.18s)]
*  It's kind of a sad thing to see it coming to this. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3816.18s)]
*  But it's also particularly tough when the entire establishment embraced this racialism for like 15 straight years. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3819.18s)]
*  It's a very tough thing to turn off. And so here's where we are. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3831.18s)]
*  I'll let you have the final word on that one, Rob. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3835.18s)]
*  Then we got to wrap up. Yeah, listen, that I do not endorse that lady's behavior and you can't be doing that. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3838.18s)]
*  But I think on top of what you're saying is sometimes you can have a bad moment in life and it doesn't need to be for the entire internet to judge or shame you for. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3844.18s)]
*  And in this case, in my opinion, words are not violence. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3855.18s)]
*  That does not make it OK to engage in it. But it's not like she beat up the little kid. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3859.18s)]
*  And so you can have a bad interaction in the park and move on from that in your life. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3864.18s)]
*  I don't think that that will. I don't think I don't think that that autistic kid's life has been ruined over that incident. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3870.18s)]
*  And I don't know, there's something. It's like both parties are just wrong. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3878.18s)]
*  You know, you're not allowed to do that at the park, but taking every moment that people have and then just post them online to try and ruin them. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3883.18s)]
*  I don't think that that's necessarily. Yeah, I even sometimes I even think violence is the answer is preferable to like public public shame ruining. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3890.18s)]
*  Like I remember back in the day where and it was to me at least the worst thing that Louis C.K. was accused of that I heard because I didn't really think that much of like like, oh, you're like, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3900.18s)]
*  you're like girls drinking in his room at like two in the morning and then he brings up like jerking off in front of you and then you agree and then he does it. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3911.18s)]
*  And then later you feel bad. Like I was like, I don't know. So leave. Don't be there to begin with. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3919.18s)]
*  There was one story where I guess they were like on set at work and he just went to one of the girls and he was like, hey, can I like masturbate in front of you? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3924.18s)]
*  And she was like, no. And then he was like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm like sick. I shouldn't have said that. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3934.18s)]
*  And then to me, that was like the most inappropriate. But I almost go like, I think the answer to that should have been her boyfriend coming in and punching Louis in the face and then moving on. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3939.18s)]
*  And then you move on with your life. But your answer to this shouldn't be to like ruin you to put this out for everyone so that you're for the rest of your life. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3950.18s)]
*  You're just known as this person. You can never get a job. You can never you know what I'm saying? Like this. That's just that's not right either. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3959.18s)]
*  So I completely agree with you. It's all kind of sad and wrong. But I also do think it would serve people well to to read the temperature in the room. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3966.18s)]
*  And look, that stuff that I was saying about like how black people were siding with OJ in the truck. Listen, there's probably was a time where this was understandable and made sense. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3975.18s)]
*  And that black people have been fucked over in this country for long enough that they were like, nah, fuck that. We're going to be on the side of our guys at a certain point. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3986.18s)]
*  You have to stop doing that or everyone's going to do it. And so I would just say I think we'd all be better off if everyone just stopped doing that. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=3994.18s)]
*  Perhaps that's a pipe dream, but I am not so sure it is. All right. We got to wrap on that. Thank you guys so much for listening. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=4003.18s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow with a brand new episode. See you then. Peace. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=4009.18s)]
*  You. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v46vpfj68Do&t=4024.18s)]
