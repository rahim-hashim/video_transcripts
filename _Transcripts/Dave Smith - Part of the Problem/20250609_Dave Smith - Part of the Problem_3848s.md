**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A)
*  What's up? What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=0.0s)]
*  Birds are chirping. Robbie the fire. Bernstein is out in some nice location. Where are you? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=13.0s)]
*  This is a beautiful San poin, Idaho. We just wrapped up a great evening of porches and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=19.36s)]
*  now I'm on to Reno Salt Lake city with you and wise guys, Las Vegas. So come out, make [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=24.48s)]
*  me look good to the club. That's right. Come on out and see a great comedy show while you're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  at it. And of course, that's right. Me and Rob this Friday and Saturday will be out in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=34.28s)]
*  Salt Lake City. I'm looking forward to that comic Dave Smith dot com for those ticket [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=38.16s)]
*  links and our tour for the rest of the year. And then the porch tour for the porch tour [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=42.32s)]
*  dot com for Rob, the rest of Rob's solo run. All right. So the big story that what's going [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=47.92s)]
*  on since last week spoke, Rob, is well, there was the the Elon Musk fallout of the Elon [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=57.04s)]
*  Musk, Donald Trump fallout. And then as some have speculated might be related, although [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  I'm not sure it is. But the the L.A. riots, which is what can you say? This is what L.A. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=70.16s)]
*  is. This is what L.A. does have really taken over the last couple of days. It is there's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=76.2s)]
*  a lot to this, the like dynamics that are going on here. But on its just at the start [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  of it, it should say it is. I was just reading this earlier today. It is the first time that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=90.84s)]
*  the National Guard has been deployed to break up riots since the L.A. riots of the 90s. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=97.72s)]
*  And this was pretty crazy to me, Rob. It is the first time that the National Guard has [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=104.12s)]
*  been deployed against the wishes of the state government. So like where it was opposed by [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=111.44s)]
*  the governor and the National Guard was forced on the state government since Selma in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=119.28s)]
*  civil rights movement. So there this is there is something historic about this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  And so I guess maybe that's just the first place to start. I've got a bunch of thoughts [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=133.04s)]
*  on this. They are not exactly linear. So I want to give you a chance to kind of give your [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=138.96s)]
*  take on this. But essentially, there's a lot of different things that are going on here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  One of the major things is that as we've kind of covered this since Donald Trump's got back [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=152.16s)]
*  into power, that the immigration enforcement in terms of deportations, forget border security, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=159.12s)]
*  which is kind of a separate issue. I mean, they're related, but it is a separate issue. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=168.0s)]
*  Border security is easy and it's popular. And you're not going to get much pushback from the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=172.88s)]
*  voting base over that. You know, people did not like Joe Biden's de facto open borders. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=182.24s)]
*  They're quite pleased that the number of migrant crossings has gone way down. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=190.16s)]
*  And there's broad support for border security. Deportations, while there has been broad support [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=195.12s)]
*  in abstract for deportations, me and you have been talking about for several months now that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=203.04s)]
*  this is an issue where there's the real potential for Donald Trump to fall into something here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=210.4s)]
*  Like, you know, if they're done in too brutal of a way, they can really turn people off. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=217.76s)]
*  Another dynamic kind of separate from that has been the, and this is really, I think, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=225.68s)]
*  over the last year, one of the most interesting things in American politics is that the protests [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=231.2s)]
*  over Donald Trump have been essentially non-existent. It was shocking to me. But the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  protests throughout the campaign, you know, Donald Trump was going and doing events in Manhattan [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=245.92s)]
*  and there was almost no protests about it. This is just very different than 2016 or 2020. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=251.2s)]
*  You say don't have the budget. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, there's, you know, we can get into a lot of that too. There was actually a piece in the New [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=262.4s)]
*  York Post this morning, I'm not sure if you saw it, about some of the groups that they've already [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=266.96s)]
*  linked to these protests. It turns out this is one of the things that a lot of Americans have [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=270.96s)]
*  woken up to over the last few years is that mass protest movements seem to not be quite as organic [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  as the way we like to think of them when we tell ourselves stories. I'm not sure exactly to what [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=283.28s)]
*  extent that's true in the past, but it's certainly very true in the recent past. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=289.76s)]
*  Now you have a situation where for the first time since Donald Trump's been president [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  in his second term, you're seeing protests on the streets. And what that ends up doing is it kind of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=301.2s)]
*  like it conjures up this not so distant memory of the crazy riots that we saw during 2020, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=310.0s)]
*  which were the longest sustained riots since the LA riots. And I did quite a bit more property damage [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=317.44s)]
*  than the original LA riots in the 90s. I think all of these things are at work here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=325.44s)]
*  And especially when you're kind of going into the summer months to see these protests turning [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=333.2s)]
*  into riots, I think there's a view from the Trump administration, which I think is largely fair [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=341.76s)]
*  and correct, that they did not do enough to put down the riots of 2020 and that ultimately that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=350.08s)]
*  hurt Donald Trump in his reelection year. And so they reacted much quicker this time around. And [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=358.16s)]
*  so I think all of these things are kind of at work. I also think that one of the elements that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=367.52s)]
*  almost gets forgotten when we talk about how the corporate media discredited themselves over the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=375.68s)]
*  last five years or so, because there's so many other things that just race to your mind first, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=382.0s)]
*  but it is while we're talking about riots, it is important to mention that the corporate media [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=386.96s)]
*  and the Democratic establishment and much of the Republican establishment all went all in on [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=396.64s)]
*  supporting the George Floyd summer of love riots in 2020. And that that turned out to be enormously [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=402.48s)]
*  unpopular and that Donald Trump by opposing them actually was on the winning side of that issue. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=411.92s)]
*  And ultimately, if you remember Rob, Joe Biden had to come out and denounce the riots [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  because it got to a point where even amongst Democrats, they were wildly unpopular. It turns [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=425.04s)]
*  out like burning shit and terrorizing people isn't that popular for very long. So you do see [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=431.12s)]
*  more of an understanding of that. The riots also became a thing that became fodder to mock [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  the corporate media, you know, with their fiery but mostly peaceful and, you know, images of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=444.72s)]
*  reporters standing in front of a car that's on fire talking about how peaceful everybody is. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  They're not quite doing that or they're not laying it on as thick this time. So yeah, go ahead. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=454.0s)]
*  There was also the COVID element from what I remember of that no one was allowed out of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=460.64s)]
*  their house. No one was allowed to congregate, but somehow rioting in the name of racism [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=464.48s)]
*  protected you from COVID, which also just amplified the cartoonish behavior of the press as they [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=470.08s)]
*  both described protests as being relatively peaceful. While damage was being done to minority [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=475.84s)]
*  businesses, that was absurd. And then also the fact that after years of lockdowns and COVID, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=481.6s)]
*  people were being encouraged to now congregate outdoors for this one specific activity that I [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=487.04s)]
*  guess like sitting down in a restaurant, then you're suddenly protected from COVID. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is the wellness [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=497.12s)]
*  company and specifically their Parasite Cleanse. If you've been feeling brain fog, even when you're [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=501.36s)]
*  exercising and eating clean, it might not be burnout. It could be parasites. Now, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=506.96s)]
*  groundbreaking research from Dr. Alan McDonald revealed a direct link between chronic parasite [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=512.16s)]
*  infections and neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis. Parasites can cause inflammation, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=518.0s)]
*  nerve damage, and long-term cognitive decline. More reasons to do a full body cleanse at least [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=523.92s)]
*  once a year. The wellness company has a solution for you. It's ivermectin and mabendazole. The [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=529.92s)]
*  gold standard parasite solution now combined in one cleanse combo designed to eliminate [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=536.64s)]
*  harmful invaders and support your immune system naturally. Medical grade, not some trendy herbal [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=542.8s)]
*  gimmick. Fill out their quick intake form and get a three month supply shipped straight to your door. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=548.8s)]
*  Maha is officially here and the wellness company is making hard to get medications digitally [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=554.7199999999999s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. Yeah, it was, if you remember at the time, because me and [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  Rob had already been out against the COVID regime at this point, this is the summer of 2020, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=590.0s)]
*  but I remember both of us commenting that we thought that that was, at the time, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=596.64s)]
*  we felt like that was kind of a turning point moment when a lot of people became more comfortable [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=601.92s)]
*  opposing the COVID insanity because it was, I mean you can't make this stuff up. It was coming off [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=607.44s)]
*  months of lockdowns and two days before the riots broke out, or they start the protests that very [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=614.48s)]
*  quickly turned to riots, but two days before the George Floyd riots, which I believe were in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  Minneapolis at first, they were mocking people for being outside not wearing masks. They were [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  literally sitting there going like, oh, turn the camera around so you can see [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=637.12s)]
*  the guy here without a mask on. And then two days later, you're allowed to do it. You're allowed to [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=642.64s)]
*  not only take your son for a walk without a mask, but you're allowed to get together in a group of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  100,000 people and all be together. So it was really a moment that kind of changed, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=656.8s)]
*  it changed how much people were willing to tolerate the COVID stuff and it changed people's [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  kind of, it made people feel more comfortable to be like, okay, I think the whole media apparatus [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=670.8s)]
*  is lying to me. That's what it seems to be here. I'm not sure if it's better with Rob [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=676.0s)]
*  muting and unmuting because I don't know if that's like every time he talks, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=682.64s)]
*  the noise is going to come back in, but we'd give it a shot. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  I think I'm better off. I'll stay muted until I'm piping in. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=691.76s)]
*  Okay. All right. Sounds good. All right. So look, I guess, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=695.36s)]
*  you know, I'll say this. I saw that Alex, oh God, I still have not learned how to pronounce his [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=701.36s)]
*  last name. I really do feel bad now because that's on me. But Alex Narosta, I think is how you say [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=707.28s)]
*  it, was, who was my debate opponent at the Soho forum the other day. I did appreciate this. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  He tweeted the other day, or it was earlier today or yesterday, he tweeted, there is never any [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=721.36s)]
*  excuse for a riot, which I did appreciate, especially because he's one of these open [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  borders libertarians. And obviously I disagree with that and think it's kind of goofy, but [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=733.28s)]
*  I did think it was, that was a, it was good that he had that take. Of course, he followed it up by [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=737.84s)]
*  talking about how terrible the deportations and things like that are, but there is something very [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=744.88s)]
*  fundamentally. And I, you know, it kind of brings me back to the summer of 2020, when I remember I [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=750.24s)]
*  ruffled a lot of feathers amongst libertarians by being so harshly critical of the George Floyd [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  riots. But I do think that that's the most important starting point with all of this shit, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=766.32s)]
*  what Alex tweeted, like that, that is the, no matter what your views are on anything else. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=772.88s)]
*  And that, including if you're a hardcore libertarian like me or Rob, there is no excuse [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=778.24s)]
*  for riots and we must all oppose riots. It's like, it seems like such a basic thing that you would [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  never even need to say this. If you're doing like a show about politics, like if there couldn't be one [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=791.28s)]
*  starting point that we all agree on, you'd imagine it should be that. But I will say, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=797.6s)]
*  particularly for libertarians, you know, sometimes right wingers, when they're being critical of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=802.48s)]
*  libertarianism, they will say something to the effect of like, you know, order has to precede [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  liberty. Like order is kind of the foundation and then liberty is something you can have up on the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=817.1999999999999s)]
*  top of it. I think the truth is that order has to precede everything. It has to precede any type of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=822.8s)]
*  civilization. And if the core of libertarianism is believing that like at the top, the highest [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=831.92s)]
*  political goal ought to be liberty. And this is based on a belief in like private property rights [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=839.12s)]
*  and the non-aggression principle. Well, okay. But what is a riot other than the biggest threat to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=844.8s)]
*  property rights and the non-aggression principle? It is that by definition, you're talking about [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=850.88s)]
*  hurting people and destroying their property. And that's what we're seeing here. And I really [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  don't, you know, I think no matter where you stand on any issue, no matter how important it is, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=862.96s)]
*  whether it's war or immigration or the economy or taxation or any of this stuff, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=868.88s)]
*  you are not allowed to start setting cars on fire, to start assaulting people, to start taking over [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=875.5200000000001s)]
*  public areas. Like all of this stuff is, it is anti-civilizational by its nature. And I think that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=883.04s)]
*  all serious people must oppose rioting. And it's fundamentally unserious to do anything else [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=892.4s)]
*  than oppose it. And, you know, I got to say in this type of situation, I do understand why Donald [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=902.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump's instinct was to be like, this has to be put down and we cannot allow this to continue. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=911.6s)]
*  You know, there's no shortage of ways that you can legitimately express opposition to government [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  policies in this country. Just essentially what a riot is, is an adult temper tantrum in a large [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=927.76s)]
*  group. And that cannot be one of the ways that's allowed. Like it's not acceptable for my three [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=939.84s)]
*  year old. So it's certainly not acceptable for adults to just start destroying things. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=945.6800000000001s)]
*  So that would be my starting point. But then Rob, take it. And any thoughts on any of this that you [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=951.44s)]
*  have? Go ahead. Well, I guess also on the riots, some are trying to say that Donald Trump provoked [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=956.64s)]
*  the riots in the way that he went about deporting people in California. And I think your top kind of [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=962.4s)]
*  side view of immigration of, hey, the border, we needed to close the border, the border was closed. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=973.12s)]
*  When it comes to deportation, I think we actually need to overhaul our immigration policy. Everyone, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=978.48s)]
*  go listen. I just did an incredible interview with David Stockman and also Mike Mishtalk for Zero Hedge. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=983.76s)]
*  They're brilliant economists and they gave a good breakdown of why immigrant labor is actually [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=989.2s)]
*  so important to our country. And Stockman has said, I think it's only 10,000 people are allowed to [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=993.44s)]
*  legally immigrate here. And the actual demand for foreign workers significantly higher than that, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=998.72s)]
*  which has created a lot of the chaos of a non-government policy of something that [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1003.76s)]
*  a lot of businesses and people actually want. With all that being said, I think there was too [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1008.4s)]
*  much illegal immigration over the Biden administration and there probably needs to be [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1014.88s)]
*  some level of deportations now. And some of it will be heavy handed, but there needs to be something [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1018.64s)]
*  to correct and let people know, hey, even if there's a democratic administration that's going to let [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1024.4s)]
*  you come in, you might not want to just come in. And you're not going to get a perfect enforcement [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1029.04s)]
*  of this policy. I don't know exactly who you deport, what's the nice way of deporting them, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1034.0s)]
*  but there's some level of people that I do think it's reasonable for Donald Trump to be deporting, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1039.12s)]
*  to have an agenda where you're claiming you're going after the criminals first. I think that's [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1044.08s)]
*  probably the best way to sell it and the best approach, but some people are going to get [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1047.28s)]
*  deported. So the idea that if you're going to go ahead and deport them, people are going to riot, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1050.72s)]
*  and now you can't enact your government policy that you actually have a mandate to do. I don't [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1054.8s)]
*  think it's fair to say, well, the natural cause of enforcing this policy is going to be riots, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1060.56s)]
*  so don't enforce the policy. And then once the riots are happening, firstly, I'm going to guess [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1064.96s)]
*  if you actually talk to law enforcement, they're happy that someone had their back. I'm going to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1070.16s)]
*  guess that people who are not engaged in the riots are happy that there aren't going to be riots and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1074.0s)]
*  we're not just going to signal, hey, go ahead and riot and burn down businesses. And then after [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1078.16s)]
*  what happened with January 6th, I don't want to hear from liberal leaders of, oh, it's our call [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1083.28s)]
*  whether or not you're going to have National Guard, because they failed on January 6th. From [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1088.48s)]
*  what I understand, there was an opportunity to have National Guard in the Capitol. They chose not [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1093.0400000000002s)]
*  to do so. And then that situation escalated to where people had to go to jail for no reason. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1097.68s)]
*  So I don't really understand if there's a riot and the president has access to the National Guard, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1103.3600000000001s)]
*  that's not the military coming in and enforcing curfews in our cities and going into our homes. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1109.2s)]
*  That does not seem to be a trampling of liberties or some sort of an escalation. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1113.68s)]
*  It seems to be a very specific incident and a wise move. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1117.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I completely agree with you. And I also think that there's, you know, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1121.2s)]
*  there's kind of something interesting to me and like the pure theory of all of it. But, you know, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1126.56s)]
*  a lot is made. What ends up happening is that... So look, and it should be pointed out in this case [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1133.44s)]
*  that Donald Trump actually, you know, he took pretty swift action here, but he didn't invoke [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1139.6799999999998s)]
*  the Insurrection Act. He didn't, you know, they floated out some ideas like Hegs have said [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1147.44s)]
*  something about sending the Marines in or something like that. But really, what has happened, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1153.2s)]
*  at least so far, is the National Guard was sent in. They seem to mostly be protecting government [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1158.0800000000002s)]
*  buildings. And what's been going on, the violence that's been seen, has been done by the LAPD. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1163.1200000000001s)]
*  So it isn't as if this was Donald Trump who... Like all those videos where you saw the video of [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1168.96s)]
*  the reporter lady get hit with a rubber bullet or like some of them pepper spraying the crowd and [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1173.52s)]
*  stuff. That was all LAPD doing that. So, you know, that's just worth pointing out. But I got to say... [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1177.84s)]
*  And also, on that note, okay, if you can criticize the idea of having federal buildings, you can [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1183.52s)]
*  criticize the idea of having a National Guard. But if you have federal buildings and then you [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1190.24s)]
*  take the National Guard to protect your federal buildings, what offense has been done there? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1194.48s)]
*  And then furthermore, when all of a sudden you have the media crying and you've got newsome [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1198.8s)]
*  crying, hey, this situation was under control. We didn't need this here. I'm protecting my [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1202.6399999999999s)]
*  federal buildings. I don't think you have it under control. The criticism seems to just be [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1207.28s)]
*  trying to paint the picture that Donald Trump is fully authoritarian and he's gonna, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1212.56s)]
*  you know, be marching the army into cities. And, you know, maybe we should just let California [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1216.3999999999999s)]
*  fail and be a failure USA in its own state. But in the meantime, it's still a part of the country. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1221.52s)]
*  And I don't know, this just doesn't seem all that heavy handed. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1226.72s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Massachips. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1229.84s)]
*  They're a new sponsor. We love having them on board. Did you know all chips and fries used to [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1235.52s)]
*  be cooked in tallow up until the 1990s when big corporations switched to cheap processed seed oils. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1240.8s)]
*  Today, seed oils make up 20% of the average American's daily calories. And recent studies [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1247.92s)]
*  have linked seed oils to metabolic health issues and inflammation in the body. Massa decided to do [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1254.24s)]
*  something about it. They created a tasty and delicious tortilla chip with just three ingredients [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1260.16s)]
*  and no seed oils, organic nixtamalized corn, sea salt and 100% grass fed beef tallow. These chips [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1265.28s)]
*  don't only avoid the bad stuff, but they taste incredible too. Massa is crunchier, tastier and [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1274.16s)]
*  sturdier than other chips. It doesn't break in your guac or salsa. So that's always good. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1279.76s)]
*  Massachips are beloved by tens of thousands of customers and have been endorsed by industry [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1284.96s)]
*  leading health and nutrition experts like Ben Greenfield and Gary Brekka. Ready to give Massa [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1290.56s)]
*  a try? Go check them out at massachips.com slash Dave and use the promo code Dave for 25% off your [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1296.56s)]

*  Well, I agree. And that's why I got to say there's... Because for people who don't know, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1319.52s)]
*  I'm a libertarian and I was at one point kind of like a theory bro who was obsessed with libertarian [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1325.44s)]
*  theory. I'm more concerned these days with what's actually going on in the world and what is going [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1331.3600000000001s)]
*  to... And consequentialism in general, what's going to lead to a better outcome. But just with [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1338.16s)]
*  this topic, there's so many interesting theory questions that come up. And so you just touched [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1344.48s)]
*  on another one there, which is kind of like the idea of states' rights and the idea that generally [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1350.24s)]
*  speaking, I do favor states having more sovereignty and the central federal government having less. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1356.88s)]
*  And even if it's issues that I don't completely agree with, I kind of like the idea of federalism [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1364.08s)]
*  and 50 laboratories of innovation and all that stuff. There is something kind of particularly [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1370.32s)]
*  uniquely different about immigration. And again, generally speaking, I'd be fine with states [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1377.04s)]
*  exercising more control over immigration. The issue becomes that we basically have kind of like [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1385.2s)]
*  this system where there's an agreement between the 50 states that you're allowed to freely travel. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  There aren't going to be checkpoints between California and its neighbors. And so therefore, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1399.68s)]
*  if Texas and Arizona want to close their border and California wants to leave it wide open, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1406.8s)]
*  just to use an example, to use an extreme to paint an example, well, that kind of isn't just [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1412.56s)]
*  a decision California is making for California. Because now that people are in the country, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1418.0s)]
*  they can freely enter anywhere else in the country from there. And so it just makes the situation a [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1422.32s)]
*  bit more complicated. But to the other theory question that I was kind of getting at before, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1428.32s)]
*  I do think that there's a tendency and I think that this is something that like left libertarians [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1433.36s)]
*  get completely wrong. And I think more just like liberals and leftists tend to get wrong too. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1440.0s)]
*  But when you see, you see, so first of Gavin Newsom can say it's under control. It's like, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1446.96s)]
*  I don't know, dude, when cars are on fire in the middle of the road, I don't consider that [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1452.72s)]
*  under control. So I don't know what, like, I don't know that that needs any more than that as a [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1456.48s)]
*  reputation. But there is something like the left libertarians or the left liberals, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1462.24s)]
*  they tend to see you go, okay, here is a group of people protesting. And they think of protesting [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1469.2s)]
*  as like a natural right, or something like that, which I think is not exactly the correct frame, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1476.24s)]
*  you know, the correct lens to view it through. It's more what what libertarians and good right [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1482.48s)]
*  libertarians understand is that all rights are property rights. You have a right to protest [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1488.0s)]
*  on your property or on property you're invited on to you don't have a right to come protest on my [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1494.8000000000002s)]
*  property if I do not want you here, just like you don't have freedom of speech or freedom of travel [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1500.24s)]
*  or these are all abstractions. Tangible natural rights are based on what you own, including owning [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1504.8000000000002s)]
*  yourself, including like the most basic rights of like you, you know, this isn't like whether you [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1511.12s)]
*  rent or own property, this is like what you you own yourself, you own your possessions, things like [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1515.4399999999998s)]
*  that. And so when the left liberals will see a group of people protesting, they tend to go, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1521.1999999999998s)]
*  well, that's their right there. These are the, you know, the, the voices of the unheard or whatever [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1527.28s)]
*  it is they tell themselves. And then when you see police, like shooting rubber bullets into a crowd, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1533.36s)]
*  you go, well, that's authoritarianism. I mean, here you have a group of people protesting and [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1540.24s)]
*  they're being met with like the heavy hand of the law. Shouldn't we oppose that? We believe in liberty. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1546.24s)]
*  We don't believe in this kind of authoritarianism. But there's much like with the immigration [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1551.36s)]
*  question itself, there's kind of some more fundamental questions to be asked here. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1557.36s)]
*  And one of them might be like, well, what exactly do you like, what is this right to protest? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1562.56s)]
*  And what exactly do you have a right to do? Like, do I have a right to go onto the highway [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1569.44s)]
*  and for us to all link arms and just stop traffic? Do I have a right to do that? Because I don't like [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1576.64s)]
*  some government policy. Do I have a right to say we are going to now quasi-kidnap these people who [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1582.8s)]
*  are in the middle of the highway and stop them in their tracks and majorly inconvenience, you know, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1590.48s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people perhaps do enormous damage to the economy? Is that correct? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1596.8s)]
*  Now, sir, I would argue, no, you do not. You do not have that right. This is a public highway. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1603.04s)]
*  And in this case, in LA, it was in public streets. I don't think you have a right to just take that [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1608.72s)]
*  over for the cause that you believe in. Like, I don't think that's correct. And this is not like, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1613.28s)]
*  it's much different. It's almost as if people will treat it like if the cops, like, shoot rubber [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1619.84s)]
*  bullets into a crowd of people, that if it hits some person, that person there was just like an [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1628.9599999999998s)]
*  innocent bystander who happened to get hit. But this is not the same as like dropping a bomb on [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1634.9599999999998s)]
*  a city where the property rights are kind of very clear, like that was that person's home. And even [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1641.04s)]
*  like, say, like in the case of like, Israel, Gaza, they'll say, Oh, we told them to flee. But [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1646.96s)]
*  even in half those times, you're like, Yeah, but they're trapped in like a tiny little strip of [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1653.2s)]
*  land that's very densely populated. And, you know, like, there's the area that you say is safe, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1657.1200000000001s)]
*  they get shot up when they go there, and they don't have the resources to move around. It's [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1663.3600000000001s)]
*  very different to tell people they have to flee their own homes, than to tell someone, you got to [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1667.28s)]
*  leave the middle of the highway. You don't have a right to be here right now. And to me, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1672.08s)]
*  as flawed as it is, as flawed as anything that the government ever does is, which is includes all of [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1678.48s)]
*  it, you know, it's like, this is the problem of government in general. But if the cops are coming [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1684.8799999999999s)]
*  and saying, Okay, there's a group that's become violent, they are assaulting people, they are [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1692.56s)]
*  terrorizing people, they're lighting cars on fire, they're looting, they're doing like all this [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1699.2s)]
*  violent shit, and they're in the middle of public property. And the cops come to him and say, You [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1704.72s)]
*  have to leave. And you stay there. It seems to me like you're not some innocent bystander anymore, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1709.6000000000001s)]
*  you are choosing to participate in a riot. And you may not even be like, you know, you may not be [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1718.0800000000002s)]
*  actively rioting yourself. But I don't know, it seems pretty reasonable to me that if the whole [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1724.72s)]
*  thing is devolved into a riot, and you're told that you have to leave and you refuse to, you've [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1730.16s)]
*  basically at this point now it kind of accepted a dual from my perspective. Like, I don't know, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1736.16s)]
*  I'm just saying like, what is it that is supposed to be done in that situation? Is the correct [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1742.96s)]
*  answer that the police and the National Guard and the state government and the federal government [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1749.3600000000001s)]
*  are just well, they're outside. And so they have a right to destroy anything they want to. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1754.6399999999999s)]
*  That doesn't seem to me to be a reasonable conclusion. And it doesn't seem to me to be [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1761.36s)]
*  too unreasonable that like, you're told you have to leave, you don't have a right to be doing this [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1765.9199999999998s)]
*  right now. And ultimately, we're going to enforce that. I just don't really have a problem with that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1770.8s)]
*  And I think the left liberals and and left libertarians, I think they get this issue all [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1778.6399999999999s)]
*  wrong. It's not the case that you just have a right to go take over public property and do [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1783.36s)]
*  whatever you want to do there. I don't know any thoughts on any of that, Rob? Well, I guess the [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1788.3999999999999s)]
*  only concern I don't, I don't disagree with you. But I have this cartoonish concern of essentially [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1793.6s)]
*  a very peaceful protest that law enforcement declares being a riot, even though that there [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1799.52s)]
*  is no writing, and then they're allowed to forcibly remove or, you know, be violent towards that crowd, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1804.24s)]
*  because, you know, I've just seen the way the government lies to me. And I can see a Tom Homan [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1811.12s)]
*  being on the news and going, No, that was a riot. And the media is lying to you. It was not a [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1815.6799999999998s)]
*  peaceful protest. And then having a very heavy handed, you know, approach towards peaceful [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1819.84s)]
*  protesters. But I do agree with you. But I mean, I guess I do agree with you that once it is [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1825.4399999999998s)]
*  blatantly riot conditions, if you're just hanging out around the rioters, but you're not the actual [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1832.4799999999998s)]
*  rioter, it's pretty hard for law enforcement to be able to make that distinction. And the fact that [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1837.68s)]
*  you're with you're a part of the crowd does mean that you're kind of actively giving cover for the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1842.48s)]
*  people that are doing the rioting. And so, you know, I, so I agree with you that kind of once it's riot [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  conditions, you know, police should have the ability to, I guess, squash that. Yeah, I mean, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1852.88s)]
*  look, it's you brought up a very fair point there. It's just that like, that that's one error. And [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1859.6000000000001s)]
*  then on the other side, you could imagine, imagine Rob, a scenario where there are riots, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1864.72s)]
*  and the media is telling you, No, they're completely peaceful protests. What are you [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1870.56s)]
*  talking about? And I think that, you know, look, there is something, there's something that riots [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1874.32s)]
*  provoke, that is, which I'm probably guilty of right now in this conversation, it's, it's, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1883.3600000000001s)]
*  there's something very, like, deeply instinctual and hardwired into our DNA, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1889.36s)]
*  for riots to, like, evoke emotions, they, they evoke a very excited emotion out of the people [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1899.12s)]
*  partaking in them. And they, they evoke fear. And they really, I mean, they get people, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1907.76s)]
*  you know, they look, look, even with like, say, like, January 6, as you use that as an example [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1915.68s)]
*  before, there's a reason why the the corporate media and the democrats jumped on that. And [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1920.56s)]
*  there's a reason why it was effective propaganda, at least for a while, until more information [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1928.08s)]
*  started coming out. But there is something they took that and they go look at this riot, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1933.68s)]
*  this riot, look at this video of people breaking windows or wrestling with police or this is chaos, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1939.68s)]
*  you know, and there's something very deeply rooted in humans to not want chaos. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1947.2s)]
*  Nobody wants that, you know, and, and of course, the same thing was done on the right about the [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1954.96s)]
*  riots in 2020. Now, obviously, we could sit here and analyze this and go, you know, the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1962.0s)]
*  riots in 2020 resulted in like dozens of murders and hundreds of assaults and billions of dollars [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1966.72s)]
*  in property damage. So like they were a little bit worse than January 6, there's something like that. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1972.8s)]
*  But the bottom line to me is that riots are never justified, never justifiable. There's, you know, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1978.16s)]
*  well, look, I guess I should say with the caveat, riots against governments could be justified. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1990.4s)]
*  It's never a wise strategy unless you have more overwhelming force than that government or almost [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=1997.6000000000001s)]
*  never a wise strategy. But riots on private property are just simply never justified, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2003.44s)]
*  or never justifiable. And so, you know, again, you're left, you're left in a in a bad situation [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2009.2800000000002s)]
*  with nothing but bad options. But it does seem to me that the worst of the bad options is to say, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2017.8400000000001s)]
*  well, they started rioting, and therefore we can't lay a finger on them. That just to me doesn't [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2024.4s)]
*  seem reasonable. And then the other thing I would mention, because this is, again, it's kind of [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2030.72s)]
*  taken me back to five years ago. But one of the things that I think it's, it's almost like, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2035.92s)]
*  sometimes people get too hyper focused on politics. I know I'm one to talk. But sometimes [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2047.92s)]
*  people get so hyper focused on politics, that they, they kind of cast aside human psychology. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2054.4s)]
*  And it's almost like everything should just be treated at face value. Like, this is a political [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2062.24s)]
*  statement and nothing more. And I remember, I was listening to Cornell West, who, you know, like, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2069.36s)]
*  you know, I'm sure I would disagree with Cornell West on quite a number of topics. But he's like, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2079.28s)]
*  amongst lefties, he's kind of one of the lefties that I like a bit, you know, he's like, he's kind [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2085.6s)]
*  of good on the stuff you expect a lefty to be good on. And he's, you know, he's, he's not a coward. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2091.92s)]
*  And I appreciate that. Anyway, I'd probably very largely agree with Cornell West about Israel's [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2099.12s)]
*  destruction of Gaza. For example, we'd probably really agree about the Iraq War. And you know, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2106.3199999999997s)]
*  there'd be issues that we would agree on. But I remember seeing an interview with him after you [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2111.8399999999997s)]
*  remember when the guy lit himself on fire for to stand up for the Palestinians or something like [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2117.3599999999997s)]
*  that. And he gave this whole interview afterward. And he was talking about how the guy was hero. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2124.24s)]
*  And that he just believed in the cause of the Palestinians so much, and that he saw all this [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2132.16s)]
*  human suffering. And so he had to make a statement or something. And I remember just listening to [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2137.2s)]
*  that and being like, Oh, dude, no, you've got this all wrong. This was a crazy person with severe [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2141.3599999999997s)]
*  mental health issues. Okay, that's who like that's who sets themselves on fire, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2150.08s)]
*  and then sits there burning up for a while. It's not it's not just like, oh, he believed in the [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2154.88s)]
*  cause more than other people did. You know what I'm saying? Like, you're missing the whole thing. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2159.36s)]
*  If you think that's the case. And likewise, I think it is often been treated as a given [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2164.08s)]
*  that when people are rioting, they are rioting over the stated political grievance [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2171.92s)]
*  that this may be a protest started as. But like, all you have to do is go watch some videos of [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2178.8799999999997s)]
*  riots. And just think about human psychology and groupthink and things like that. Before you just [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2185.44s)]
*  dissuaded of any of those notions. It's not true. Like the the George Floyd riots had nothing to do [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2192.7999999999997s)]
*  with George Floyd. Nothing. Now I'm not saying that the people protesting with picket signs [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2200.24s)]
*  earlier that day had nothing to do with George Floyd. There's a connection there. It's still not [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2205.68s)]
*  quite as much of a one to one connection as some might try to make it. But there is something to [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2211.6s)]
*  that. But like, by nightfall, when every single night, the George Floyd protests are turning into [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2216.08s)]
*  a bunch of teenagers looting a Nike store, those teenagers are not looting the Nike store, because [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2222.72s)]
*  they are concerned with police brutality. The two things are not even related. It's pure opportunism. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2229.3599999999997s)]
*  It's excitement and thrilling and and a social activity. And it is a like a social status thing [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2235.8399999999997s)]
*  where young men can let off steam and demonstrate their fearlessness and they can, you know, get [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2246.7999999999997s)]
*  attain resources, you know, like get the new pair of Nikes. And like, these are the type of things [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2256.64s)]
*  that are going on. And you see it again, you just in some of the videos I've been watching of these [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2261.84s)]
*  riots. It's like, okay, I'm sorry, that part has nothing to do with immigration simply has nothing [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2266.0s)]
*  to do with it. It is just not about that, you know, and that you see all the pundits on the news [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2271.6000000000004s)]
*  trying to be like, this is the fear that the Trump administration has put it like, those people don't [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2276.1600000000003s)]
*  look very afraid to me. These don't look like people who are afraid of the law. They look like [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2281.04s)]
*  people who are setting a car on fire because it's going to make a really loud boom. That's what I'm [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2285.6000000000004s)]
*  seeing, you know. And so I just think like, as much as this is like the most basic simple point, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2291.12s)]
*  it's almost something that 99% of the coverage of this is completely missing, you know, like, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2296.24s)]
*  it's like, no, dude, this is a scene. This is an event. Now, this is an and trying to trying to [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2301.2799999999997s)]
*  analyze these things politically makes about as much sense as like trying to politically analyze [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2309.04s)]
*  a really violent mosh pit at a concert and go, what do you think this is? Is this a comment on [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2316.64s)]
*  fiscal policy? Like, no, it's not. This is a comment on young people wanting to go wild. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2322.64s)]
*  You know, it's like a thing to do a place to hang where there's a little bit of danger and a rush. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2328.56s)]
*  And, you know, you're going to break some stuff and maybe leave with a new pair of Nikes. Like, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2334.4s)]
*  that's what we're witnessing, not political. It's it's human on a different level. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2338.96s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2345.36s)]

*  party lab tested and USDA organic to ensure safety and purity. I got to tell you, I love these. I've [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2374.32s)]
*  used them for sleep and they are wonderful. So definitely go check them out. Right now, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2381.28s)]

*  Any thoughts Rob? On that note, there's this great book I recommend it to everyone. It's a real thin [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2408.56s)]
*  pamphlet. It's called a crowd and it's one of like the earliest works on propaganda. And he's got a [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2414.1600000000003s)]
*  piece in there where essentially he talks about how in riots, people will do things that they [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2420.1600000000003s)]
*  would never personally do, that there's some sort of an energy to the crowd. So like for example, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2424.0s)]
*  I would never be so violent as to stomp on some guy's head. But if in the course of a riot, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2429.04s)]
*  seven people are kicking a cop who got pulled down, you might catch yourself doing that because [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2434.0s)]
*  you're kind of bought up into the energy of what's going on. And you've kind of almost, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2438.24s)]
*  you're almost like in the crowd hypnosis where you're not making your free. I mean, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2443.4399999999996s)]
*  you still free will, but there's a capturing of the energy of a crowd. So while I agree with what [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2448.0s)]
*  you're saying, there is a little bit of like the moral excuse of, oh, we're going to protest [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2454.08s)]
*  George Floyd. And then that gets amplified too. And that gives us permission to now break into [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2458.72s)]
*  this Nike store where I think you're mostly right where it's young individuals who are like, this is [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2463.12s)]
*  a thrill. But sometimes if you give people like a little bit of a moral excuse for why they can go [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2467.68s)]
*  engage in these activities, the people that would like to engage in those activities will hop on it. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2473.12s)]
*  So believe me, there was no librarian yesterday who decided, oh, I'm so upset about these [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2478.8s)]
*  deportations that they went and they lit a car on fire. There's a guy who spent his entire life [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2486.0s)]
*  wanting to light his car on fire. And he finally got his excuse of like, oh, this is now for a [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2490.6400000000003s)]
*  cause. But that element does the element of it being somewhat for cause is and things escalating [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2495.2000000000003s)]
*  that enough people care about it, that you have the cover to do it. It's still, it still is a bit [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  of a root ingredient. Yeah, no, so sure. I don't disagree with that. And I do think that that's a [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2505.92s)]
*  fair point. And that's also part of the reason why it's so dangerous to have a culture that hands [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2512.64s)]
*  these people this kind of like moral get out of free jail, get out of jail free card where it's [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2519.2000000000003s)]
*  like, oh, you're the good guy now unquestionably. And the fact is that even if you're on the right [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2524.88s)]
*  side of an issue, you don't get just like a blank check to do whatever you want with being on the [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2531.84s)]
*  right side of that issue. Like you can still become the bad guy there. So I think that's a [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2538.1600000000003s)]
*  very fair point. Now, what is political is what the response to all of this is going to be and [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2543.1200000000003s)]
*  what the impact this is going to have on, you know, the Trump administration, his ability to govern [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2552.2400000000002s)]
*  his ability to get his agenda through. I will say so far, from what I've seen, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2557.44s)]
*  there certainly are the voices who are going as goofy as they went in 2020. I've already seen a [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2564.7200000000003s)]
*  couple people post things about how the riots are the voice of the unheard type shit, which is all [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2571.92s)]
*  just so fucking ridiculous. You know, it's only because people are marginalized and oppressed [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2577.76s)]
*  that they have to loot at Nike stores like, oh, no, I don't actually think that's true. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2583.28s)]
*  But, but it does seem more broadly speaking, that there's much more hesitation to do that [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2588.2400000000002s)]
*  than there was in 2020. You know, there's been a huge cultural shift in the last five years, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2596.1600000000003s)]
*  bigger than any cultural shift I've ever lived through in a five year period, for sure. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2604.5600000000004s)]
*  And the, you know, if you remember, this is part of the thing that brought the Kamala Harris [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2609.3599999999997s)]
*  campaign down, not the entirety of it, but this was a big factor in it was that in 2020, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2616.64s)]
*  there was just a different atmosphere and Democrats really seemed to believe that like the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2622.8799999999997s)]
*  woke shit was going to work like that this would not come back to bite them. And so they were on [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2628.48s)]
*  record saying a lot of these things like standing up for the right. I mean, literally, there were [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2634.08s)]
*  pieces titled the case for looting. Like people were writing pro looting columns in 2020. But [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2638.24s)]
*  anyway, the one I was saying about the Kamala Harris campaign is that this is why Kamala Harris [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2648.3199999999997s)]
*  in her 2020 presidential campaign, she got on the woke side of every goddamn issue. And this came [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2652.16s)]
*  back to bite her in 2024, but she was all illegal should get healthcare, the, you know, we should [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2657.52s)]
*  decriminalize illegal boarding crossings, gender reassignment surgery for prisoners, you know, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2663.68s)]
*  all these things that they were able to hang her by that she was on board because at the time it [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2669.6s)]
*  seemed like, oh, this is where we're going. We're going all in on woke. It seems to me like there [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2674.3999999999996s)]
*  is a hesitation from the establishment to kind of go that hard in on this. But I do think that [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2678.96s)]
*  the temptation is still there. And that, and this is probably part of the reason why Donald Trump [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2690.08s)]
*  took the action that he took. I think that the, this is my guess again, I'm guessing to some degree [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2695.92s)]
*  here, but I do think that one of the things that held a lot of people back from supporting Donald [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2704.3199999999997s)]
*  Trump in 2020 and to a lesser extent, but still a very real one in 2024 was that people went, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2714.16s)]
*  look, when that guy's in there, the left loses their fucking minds. And we don't really want to [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2721.52s)]
*  live in a country where half of it loses their minds. Like that's not good for anybody. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2729.2s)]
*  Right. But now that Trump is back in that, that might've been a good enough reason to not support [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2734.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, even though you recognize it's not entirely his fault, but still you didn't want to [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2743.6s)]
*  say, but now that he's back in there, I do think you're going to see this type of chaos is incredibly [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2749.12s)]
*  unpopular. And I think that the people who are being seen as siding with that or justifying that [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2756.4s)]
*  are going to lose the political argument ultimately. And I think this is actually [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2764.32s)]
*  very good for the Trump administration politically because they are on the side of, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2768.56s)]
*  you know, it almost in a way it, it, it gives them a cop out, like it, it lets them get out of [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2774.4s)]
*  actually defending their immigration policies. And instead they can just go, you can't take over [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2782.2400000000002s)]
*  city blocks and burn cars. We can't allow you to do that. And that to me is a very winning political [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2787.44s)]
*  argument. And so winning human argument of who, how many, you know, like who disagrees with that? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2794.08s)]
*  It's always like, okay, yeah, I understand you disagree with that when you're 19 and you don't [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2801.12s)]
*  own anything like, okay, but what adult actually is like, okay, with just burn it all down. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2805.52s)]
*  It's always unbelievable when you see someone in a suit and tie on TV [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2813.12s)]
*  supporting burn it all down. Like you're like, shut up. You wear a suit. You don't mean this. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2817.2s)]
*  Nobody, even those people, they'll only support it when they think it's a comfortable distance [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2823.52s)]
*  away from them. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2827.92s)]
*  which is Moink Box, longtime sponsor. I absolutely love this company. If you're anything like me, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2831.92s)]
*  you are a little bit wigged out by the meat at your supermarket. Even when it says organic or [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2838.08s)]
*  grass fed, you never really know what you're getting. And the ones that don't say that, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2843.84s)]
*  you know, you're not getting good stuff. That's why I love Moink Box. They go directly to small [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2847.7599999999998s)]
*  family farms. Their business model is simple. Moink meat comes from animals raised outdoors, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2853.2s)]
*  where a pig is free to be a pig. Their farmers are given an honest day's pay for an honest day's [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2859.3599999999997s)]
*  work and they deliver meat straight to your doorstep at prices you can actually afford. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2864.56s)]
*  Born, raised and harvested right here in the United States of America. So now you can support [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2869.6s)]
*  family farms and you can get the most delicious meat you'll ever have by joining the Moink [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2875.2s)]
*  movement. Go to MoinkBox.com slash P O T P right now to get free wings for life. They're the best [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2880.16s)]

*  let's get back into the show. So anyway, I guess that I felt like that should be mentioned in there [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2903.8399999999997s)]
*  as well. I think that's a good point because if you remember the pitch of Biden was a return to [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2909.6s)]
*  normalcy. And I think that there is a silent majority that just likes normal and not having [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2914.64s)]
*  chaos in the streets. And I think it's a hard sell right now to go that Donald Trump is provoking [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2920.56s)]
*  this by I mean, I some great ice raids on factories. It's not unheard of in this country. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2925.7599999999998s)]
*  It might not have been something that was happening over the last even eight years, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2932.4s)]
*  but I remember there used to be because it just made it was on my radar. But like [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2935.52s)]
*  Roboshkins used to be this major kosher meat corporation. I remember they once got in trouble [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2939.52s)]
*  for having too many Mexican workers and it was like a bit of a scandal at the time. And I think [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2944.8s)]
*  there was like a raid on their meat processing plants. But I remember hearing those stories. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2949.12s)]
*  It wasn't unheard of that ICE agents would show up to places with too many illegal workers and [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2953.92s)]
*  that they would get in trouble. And right now, Donald Trump does have a mandate. Listen, I don't [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2958.88s)]
*  necessarily agree with the deportation policy. And I don't necessarily agree that there isn't [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2963.36s)]
*  room in this country for a lot more cheap migrant workers. I know that's not particularly popular, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2969.36s)]
*  even with our audience that thinks that this our entire economy should be American jobs and more [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2974.4s)]
*  money in America and more made in America. But I think if you actually I mean, I'd like to dig into [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2979.44s)]
*  this topic more. I'd like to learn more about how farms are operating and the necessary the need for [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2985.0400000000004s)]
*  the immigrant labor. I know it's certainly true. Every hotel I'm in, it doesn't seem like most of [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2990.32s)]
*  the cleaning staff is American workers. The restaurants I've worked in, it's typically not [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=2994.96s)]
*  all American workers in the kitchen. So I don't know how many industries really need this and to [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3000.1600000000003s)]
*  what extent we just have a nonsense policy of pretending like we only need 10,000 new workers [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3004.6400000000003s)]
*  a year, even though we have an aging population. So you know what I mean? There is like a backdrop [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3009.6800000000003s)]
*  here of a nonsense policy that probably doesn't make sense for the country. And there's probably [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3014.8s)]
*  more of a demand for actual immigration through legal channels. But with all that said, what Biden [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3018.72s)]
*  did sneaking people as many as he could over the border was not good. It's not what the country [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3024.64s)]
*  wanted. We do need some level of deportations now to correct for that and to change the incentive [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3028.9599999999996s)]
*  structure of just sneaking in. And that comes with a better policy of who can come in here, maybe [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3034.24s)]
*  having more immigration, which I would be a fan of. But at the moment, the public wants deportations. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3039.4399999999996s)]
*  We need deportations. You're going to have it. And ICE agents doing their job. I might not agree [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3044.56s)]
*  with every person they're deporting. People that have been working here for 10, 15 years that have [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3049.6s)]
*  family and taxes. Yeah, make them the last to deport. Probably don't deport them at all. But at [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3053.2s)]
*  the end of the day, you're going to have some level of deportations. Donald Trump, it is legal for him [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3057.6s)]
*  to go ahead and deport these individuals. You can't point to then the riots and go, oh, he can't do [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3061.7599999999998s)]
*  that because there's going to be riots. That's not, you can't have a government where you can go ahead [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3067.04s)]
*  and change policy. You know, I don't agree with the drug laws in this country. But if they decided [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3070.96s)]
*  to go take down drug manufacturers with large plants of pots in states where that's illegal, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3074.96s)]
*  or maybe even legal, yeah, you can work on changing the policy, but you can't go riot and protest [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3080.8s)]
*  because they're doing what's legal. Yeah, well, it's right. Exactly. And look, it's kind of the same. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3085.44s)]
*  It's the same logic that gets you to like oppose like a horrible war or something like that. Like [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3092.8s)]
*  it's like, look, no matter how horrible a policy is and take, take drugs as a good example. I mean, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3100.32s)]
*  it's essentially institutionalized slavery. You're fucking enslaving people for the crime of possessing [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3105.6800000000003s)]
*  or distributing a plant, but I don't get to go burn down my neighbor's car. Cause I'm furious about [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3112.56s)]
*  that. Cause it doesn't matter. I don't have a right to do that. And it's not, he doesn't just have to [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3118.8s)]
*  pay for that. It's the same thing of being like, Oh, Hamas is so bad. So I get to drop a bomb on [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3124.2400000000002s)]
*  a baby. Like, no, that's not, that's, that's not civilized behavior. It's the antithesis of it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3129.12s)]
*  And yeah, so that's, you know, that, that's, I think all a fair point. I also do think that [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3136.72s)]
*  you've, you know, however, look, it's, it's a real problem to have to deport a lot of illegal [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3144.96s)]
*  immigrants. There's no clean way to do it. As you mentioned earlier, it's also not clean to just say, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3154.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, you all get to stay here because that sends a message that sends a message to that. It's like, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3161.52s)]
*  Oh, if you can get here, you get to stay. And that's good. That's going to have problems attached [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3165.92s)]
*  to it too. There's negative externalities all around here with all of these different policies. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3172.2400000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, it's, there's, there's no completely clean way to do any of this stuff. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3177.6s)]
*  I, you know, it'll be interesting to see how this develops. I think also, you know, obviously, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3184.3199999999997s)]
*  if things get worse, that will change, that will change the political realities of this. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3190.08s)]
*  If this is put away quietly and, and, and doesn't turn into a big deal, I think that [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3196.7999999999997s)]
*  that helps Donald Trump very much because it makes it look like he took Swiss Swift [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3203.44s)]
*  in decisive action. And this didn't escalate further, but already, obviously, the other [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3207.68s)]
*  dynamics involved in this too, or that this is California. Gavin Newsom is the governor there. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3214.2400000000002s)]
*  And so this is for Donald Trump, I think, in a lot of ways, as is the case with politics in general, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3221.52s)]
*  this is people like to choose the theaters in which they fight. And for Donald Trump now [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3228.32s)]
*  to pick the fight over immigration against California, against Gavin Newsom, where he's [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3236.0s)]
*  on the side of immigration controls of law and order, and Gavin Newsom, at least is, is in the [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3243.2000000000003s)]
*  eyes of many put on the side of sanctuary states and chaos in the streets. It seems to me like [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3251.36s)]
*  that's a real winning side for Donald Trump to be on. I would argue that Gavin Newsom is on the [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3260.32s)]
*  side of, hey, it's all fine. What are you talking about? There's no homeless problem. There's no [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3267.6s)]
*  energy problem. There's no fire problem. There's no jobs problem. We do the best job in California. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3271.52s)]
*  No one's ever been happier. So good luck with that cell, Gavin Newsom. Yeah. And you know, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3278.24s)]
*  there was one other thing I wanted to mention earlier, but it was, I was kind of thinking [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3283.6s)]
*  about this and I'd be curious to what like David Stockman's feelings on this would be, but I do, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3286.8799999999997s)]
*  we, we live in a statist world. The, the, you know, it's, it's interesting because the fight [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3296.56s)]
*  right now being between the U S federal government and the state of California's government are, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3305.04s)]
*  you know, the, this is a fight between the biggest government that's ever existed. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3312.64s)]
*  And then the, and the biggest state government in the United States of America, these are big [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3317.2s)]
*  governments that make a way more decisions and are involved in way more things than they ought to be. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3321.92s)]
*  But, you know, when, when you talk about kind of like this demand for labor and typically speaking, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3329.36s)]
*  what you are talking about is, is, you know, day laborers, factory positions, farming, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3336.56s)]
*  you know, agricultural work. Okay. So like you have immigration policy that is set by the government. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3343.2s)]
*  It is not set by the market. Okay. Additionally to that, we have a lot of other policies that [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3351.84s)]
*  are set by the government. One of them is school and college that is, okay, maybe not entirely set [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3360.32s)]
*  by the government, but largely set by the government. And I mean, even, even amongst like [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3368.7200000000003s)]
*  the, even within homeschooling in many States, it's regulated by the government, not all of them, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3374.48s)]
*  but certainly government, you know, public schools are a huge force in schooling and, and college [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3382.1600000000003s)]
*  is essentially a government program, including the private colleges. It's all backed up by [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3389.36s)]
*  government loans and it's heavily regulated by the government. And then you have a child labor laws, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3394.8s)]
*  which are imposed by the government. And I will say, I, you know, the somewhat controversial take, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3402.64s)]
*  I suppose, but I do think that child labor gets a bad rap. I know that you can read about some [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3408.56s)]
*  example of like, you know, a 12 year old in a factory in 1890 or something like that. And like, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3415.04s)]
*  Oh my God, look how horrible it is that they were mistreated. I think that typically when people in [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3421.12s)]
*  the current day look back at that stuff, they look back at it completely stripped of any of [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3426.72s)]
*  the historical context. Like it's not, you know, like people think like that child labor was like [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3432.7999999999997s)]
*  a creation of the industrial revolution. You know what I mean? It's like, Oh, they built these [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3438.64s)]
*  factories. And then all of a sudden these 12 year olds had to work these jobs. Like, what do you [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3442.7999999999997s)]
*  think the 12 year olds were doing a hundred years before the industrial revolution? What just laying [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3446.4s)]
*  on a, on a lazy boy recliner or something like that? Like it's like, Oh, they were doing much [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3451.6s)]
*  more grueling, backbreaking agricultural work. The factory was actually a step up from where they had [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3457.2s)]
*  been from before the industrial revolution for all of human history, all of human history, with [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3463.04s)]
*  almost no exceptions, perhaps like royalty or something like that. But the norm for humanity [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3470.88s)]
*  was as soon as you are able bodied, you start working because otherwise people starve. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3477.84s)]
*  As soon as you hit puberty, you get married and start having babies. Like this is how human [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3484.56s)]
*  civilization worked. And so it's a, we kind of like cherry pick the 12 year old at a factory. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3489.76s)]
*  And then it's, it's a very status like myth because then you look back and you go, Oh my God, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3496.4s)]
*  look how bad things were until the government came in and wrote a law when the reality of it is not [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3501.44s)]
*  that at all. The reality is like, no, look how bad all of life was until we produced our way out of [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3506.8s)]
*  that. Like until we created enough wealth where it was like, Oh, we don't need everybody to start [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3514.7200000000003s)]
*  working as soon as they're able bodied. We don't need the 13 year olds to get married and start [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3520.32s)]
*  having kids because Oh, you're everyone's not dropping dead. You know, like, Oh, okay. You can [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3525.76s)]
*  wait a little bit. Anyway, I say all of this to just say that like, you know, I, I think I was, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3530.24s)]
*  I was 12 when I got my first, like maybe not official, but I think my first job was I lived in, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3537.7599999999998s)]
*  in apartment building and the woman who owned it gave me $10 a month to take out all the trash. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3545.3599999999997s)]
*  Like it was like a big thing of trash in the back for the entire building. And then I had to like, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3555.2s)]
*  lug it all to the front and put it on the corner. And like, I just thought that was awesome. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3560.24s)]
*  It was good for me. It was, you know, anyway, I guess my question is just like, we have this whole [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3566.9599999999996s)]
*  society set up. This is not an organic function of the market at all. This is totally like top [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3572.56s)]
*  down and posed by the state that kids are not supposed to work. They're supposed to just do [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3578.7999999999997s)]
*  school. They're supposed to just be a good little Prussian soldier from age five to age 21 or [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3585.68s)]
*  something like that. And that like all of, and therefore, once you take that as a given, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3592.7999999999997s)]
*  you're like, okay, well, we need this grueling work to be done. It can only be done by illegal [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3598.7999999999997s)]
*  immigrants. But like, I kind of think that's what kids are for. And I'm not saying like all of it [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3603.8399999999997s)]
*  necessarily, but I just, I, this is kind of like a controversial view, but I actually like, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3610.24s)]
*  I'm actually a very loving kind of peaceful parents guy. But I think that particularly for like [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3615.3599999999997s)]
*  teenage boys, it's not bad to have a job in manual labor. It's not bad to do some grunt work. You can [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3622.0s)]
*  get paid a very low wage because it's not really about the money for me when I was 12, getting 10 [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3629.6s)]
*  bucks a month was huge. That was awesome. And like, I just now, this was nineties dollars. You [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3635.36s)]
*  understand Rob. So it's a little bit more than, than $10. But I'm just, I'm just saying that like, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3641.36s)]
*  I think this is another element to that, that piece that's kind of missing too, that I'm not even [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3646.1600000000003s)]
*  saying this with certainty. I'm just kind of saying like, maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3651.52s)]
*  in the world if we had some of those jobs done by American teenagers. Maybe, maybe it's not the best [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3656.1600000000003s)]
*  way to organize a society to say, no, we're going to keep men as adolescents until they're 35. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3663.76s)]
*  Like maybe it would actually be better to have 14 and 15 year olds get their hands dirty, do a gritty [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3672.7200000000003s)]
*  manual labor job. And you know, then by the time they're 21, they've got some life experience. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3678.7200000000003s)]
*  They're a little bit more of an adult, you know? Okay. Yes. They haven't, you know, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3684.8s)]
*  taken a course in feminist dance theory, but they have had, you know, like seven years of on job, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3688.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, experience. Anyway, any thoughts on that Rob? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3694.64s)]
*  Yeah. Cue the headline. Dave Smith wants to put the six year olds to work. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3697.12s)]
*  Well, I'm very lucky Rob, that I don't have to worry about having controversial opinions. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3704.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I agree with you. I worked at scattered manual labor jobs when I was in high school. I [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3708.8799999999997s)]
*  remember my roommate senior year got like a job in a deli, like over the weekends. And suddenly [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3713.76s)]
*  he just had some spending cash and was also maybe he was making 10 or $11 an hour. But you know, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3720.2400000000002s)]
*  I didn't do that, but I was also like, Hey, that kind of rules. So I agree. I listen, I don't know [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3726.0s)]
*  about the, I mean, maybe a 10 year old sweeping up wherever, like I certainly could have worked [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3730.5600000000004s)]
*  more in my youth and the couple jobs that I had here or there on my summer vacations or moving [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3736.48s)]
*  jobs that people, I don't know, there's something nice as a young dude when you're [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3742.08s)]
*  working with your hands and actually working versus sitting in school. So I'm, I'm, yeah, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3745.92s)]
*  I agree with you that there's probably more opportunities for that. Yeah. I'm not even [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3750.4s)]
*  arguing. I'm not even making an argument here. I'm just kind of like saying, I think it's a [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3754.24s)]
*  question that's worth asking. Put the kids to work is what I'm trying to say here. All right, listen, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3758.0s)]
*  that's going to be our show for today. Enjoy yourself out there, Robbie. I will meet you [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3763.36s)]
*  out in Salt Lake City on Friday. Hope to see some of you guys there really had a great time [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3768.08s)]

*  busy guy, run your mouth, still cooking, but I got a new podcast over at zero hedge. Not quite [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3798.4s)]
*  sure how often a regular that's going to be, but I did incredible interviews with both a Mish talk [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3802.56s)]
*  and with David Stockman, real deep economic stuff with guys that really know and understand it. So [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3807.68s)]
*  I think this audience would really appreciate those insights and it's on the zero hedge channel. So [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3813.12s)]
*  go, go give that a follow, give it a nice like, and you know, do the things. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3817.6s)]
*  Absolutely. And congratulations again on that new show. I will make sure to share it on, on social [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peJRTLe431A&t=3821.04s)]
