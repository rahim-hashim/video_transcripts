# Dave Smith | Trump's State of the Union Address | Part Of The Problem 1239
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M)
*  Hey, what's up everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=7.84s)]
*  I am Dave Smith, Roland Solo for this episode. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=10.28s)]
*  And of course, we're going to be talking about last night's State of the Union address, the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=14.64s)]
*  fifth that Donald Trump has given and obviously the first of his new administration. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=20.64s)]
*  Let me just real quick before we start, I just a couple quick plugs. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=29.12s)]
*  There are still limited seats available for Buffalo this weekend. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=34.2s)]
*  I'm headed out there tomorrow. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=38.6s)]
*  Tomorrow and Friday night, I'll be out in Buffalo with Robbie the Fire Bernstein. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=40.72s)]
*  And then on Saturday night, we'll be up in St. Catharines, my first time back in Canada [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=44.84s)]
*  in many, many years. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=51.84s)]
*  The early show is sold out. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=53.88s)]
*  I believe there are some tickets available for the late show. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=55.4s)]
*  It's going to sell out quickly. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=58.44s)]
*  If you want to come, make sure you go over to ComicDaveSmith.com right away and get [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=59.44s)]
*  them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=63.64s)]
*  And then of course, Boston, just a couple of weeks away at Laugh Boston there, the ticket [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=64.64s)]
*  links are all available at ComicDaveSmith.com. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=68.08s)]
*  And of course, as I've mentioned a couple of times, the tickets are moving fast. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=70.72s)]
*  I will be back at the SoHo Forum in May debating immigration against the Cato Institute's Alex [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=73.92s)]
*  Norwush. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=81.6s)]
*  Looking forward to that very much should be a good old libertarian scrap about where [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=83.2s)]
*  exactly libertarians should fall on immigration with me being more of the restrictionist and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=88.44s)]
*  Alex being closer to the open borders side of things. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so Donald Trump's State of the Union last night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=98.64s)]
*  Let's get into this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  I got a couple clips lined up and there's a few things that I kind of wanted to talk [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  about it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=110.72s)]
*  Also, I will do my best to get to some listener questions in today's episode. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=111.72s)]
*  If you guys are in the live chat, go ahead and throw some questions in there and I will [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=116.64s)]
*  do my best to get to some of them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=120.56s)]
*  Okay, let me just say this to start. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=124.32s)]
*  Generally speaking, I don't like State of the Union addresses. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=131.88s)]
*  I think that they're boring and lame. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=134.32s)]
*  They're just never good. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=139.6s)]
*  They're never entertaining. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=141.32s)]
*  They're never honest. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=142.92s)]
*  It's always spin and I never like the special interest stories and all of that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm just not a fan of the State of the Union in general. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=152.32s)]
*  That's my bias coming into this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=156.56s)]
*  Certainly, look, I'm a radical libertarian and so anytime we're talking about a president, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=160.0s)]
*  there's always going to be things that I disagree with them on and there's several things that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=166.28s)]
*  I think Trump said that I don't agree with him on and we could get into a few of those. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=170.2s)]
*  Grading on a curve of all that being considered in the background. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=179.04s)]
*  Let me just start. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=186.0s)]
*  I'll start by saying that in terms of effectiveness, just in terms of the politics, which is what [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=187.0s)]
*  a State of the Union is all about anyway. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=195.32s)]
*  I'm not saying how I personally felt about the speech, how much I agree with what Donald [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=199.56s)]
*  Trump is saying or don't agree with him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=205.32s)]
*  Just talking in terms of how effective he was politically in this speech. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  I would give Donald Trump an A+. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  I think it was his best State of the Union speech out of the five that he's given by [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=215.76s)]
*  far. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it was his most effective by far. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=222.2s)]
*  Donald Trump has really, part of the reason, of course, why this was his most effective [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=227.52s)]
*  State of the Union. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  It's not just that Trump got better. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  I do think he's gotten a little bit better in some ways, but it's not just that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=239.24s)]
*  It's that he is more enabled to be successful by the moment that he's living in. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=243.8s)]
*  This really is, if you zoom out, one of the very interesting big picture meta-analysis [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  of the current moment, which is that in a very weird way, Donald Trump, and I think [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  America as a country, we are better off that Trump lost in 2020. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=263.64s)]
*  We got four years of Joe Biden, and then Donald Trump comes back in in the second term. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=271.0s)]
*  Now, I'm not trying to downplay any of the very real pain that was caused by those four [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=275.4s)]
*  years of Joe Biden. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=282.44s)]
*  Although, if I'm being completely honest, a lot of that was baked into the cake already. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=284.48s)]
*  The price inflation that Joe Biden, that we dealt with under Joe Biden, that was coming. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  Joe Biden certainly made it worse, but a lot of that was the result of 2020. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=297.44s)]
*  You lock down the entire economy and print trillions of dollars and start handing out [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  direct payments, prices tend to end up rising. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=307.6s)]
*  This is not rocket science. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=312.04s)]
*  It's actually fairly straightforward. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=314.0s)]
*  However, there were really bad things that Joe Biden did. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=315.6s)]
*  Obviously, the war in Ukraine, which we will get into, was a disaster that was really Joe [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=319.56s)]
*  Biden's. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=324.6s)]
*  I mean, not saying nobody else held responsibility, but the Biden administration held by far the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=325.6s)]
*  most of it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=330.88s)]
*  We were flirting with World War III and nuclear war. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=334.32s)]
*  That's a pretty big cost. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=336.56s)]
*  All that being said, if Donald Trump wins in 2020, and forget any of you guys who may [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=340.2s)]
*  have whatever feelings you have about the 2020 election, leaving that aside, I'm just [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=345.88s)]
*  saying if Donald Trump had officially won and had got a second term, there's just no [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=349.44s)]
*  conceivable way that we'd have any of the positives that we have right now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  None of them. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=360.64s)]
*  I mean, literally none of them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=361.64s)]
*  We would not have had Bobby Kennedy at the health department. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=363.92s)]
*  We wouldn't have had Tulsi Gabbard leading the intelligence department. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=367.16s)]
*  We wouldn't have had, you know, there's no chance that we'd have Jay Bhattacharya at [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=371.0s)]
*  the National Institute of Health. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=375.72s)]
*  There's really no conceivable way we'd have Cash Patel running the FBI or Dan Boncino [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=378.68s)]
*  as the deputy FBI director. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  There's no way we'd have Doge. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=386.24s)]
*  Elon Musk wasn't on board with Donald Trump in 2020. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=387.72s)]
*  So anyway, this number one, it got Trump, you know, going through those years, it got, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=391.36s)]
*  I think essentially what happened, and this is also part of why Donald Trump has record [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=399.24s)]
*  high approval ratings right now, is that there, okay, so the in 2016, when Donald Trump ran [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=403.6s)]
*  for president the first time, Donald Trump had this quality about him that was very appealing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=412.2s)]
*  to a lot of people, but also it was a double edged sword and it allowed a lot of fear mongering [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=418.62s)]
*  about Donald Trump to seem reasonably plausible. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=425.46000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump was the first president in the history of the United States of America. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=431.3s)]
*  This had never happened before. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=435.86s)]
*  Okay, Donald Trump was the first president who had zero political or military experience [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=437.54s)]
*  that had never happened before. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=443.58000000000004s)]
*  Okay, like we had Dwight Eisenhower was president of the United States and he had no political [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=445.38s)]
*  experience, but he was a five star general who had led the allies to victory in World [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=451.7s)]
*  War II. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=457.7s)]
*  It'd be pretty hard for someone to look at him and make the argument, you don't have [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=458.7s)]
*  experience, sir. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=462.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=463.5s)]
*  So for the first time in our nation's history, and imagine, you know, this is the United [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=464.5s)]
*  States of America. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=470.78s)]
*  It's the most successful, most powerful country that's ever existed. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=471.85999999999996s)]
*  And we tried something in 2016 we had never tried in our hundreds year long history. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=475.05999999999995s)]
*  And now, okay, there was something appealing about that, because he could, Donald Trump, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=481.17999999999995s)]
*  there was certainly one aspect of it that was very advantageous to him. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=485.9s)]
*  And this is why he was able back in 2016 to be able to stand up on stage and say, you [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=489.94s)]
*  know, Hillary Clinton says she's going to fix this thing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=496.7s)]
*  She's been here for 30 years. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=499.46s)]
*  She can't fix it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=500.46s)]
*  How come she hasn't done it yet? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=501.46s)]
*  Oh, I'm outside of all of this corruption. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=502.73999999999995s)]
*  You see the big money. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=504.97999999999996s)]
*  I don't need any of their money. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=505.97999999999996s)]
*  Like he could he could blame all of the failures of government on the people who were involved [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=506.97999999999996s)]
*  and take responsibility for none of them very reasonably because he wasn't. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=513.38s)]
*  And he was on the right side, like as a, you know, just as a citizen, he was on the right [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=517.48s)]
*  side of some of these issues. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=520.86s)]
*  And so he could he could play that. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=523.02s)]
*  Now on the other hand, the flip side to that was that they could play the card of, you [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=524.5s)]
*  know, you can't trust Donald Trump with his finger on the button. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=530.38s)]
*  This guy's going to launch nukes. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=534.14s)]
*  The market's going to crash. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=535.9599999999999s)]
*  This guy has no idea what he's doing. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=537.2199999999999s)]
*  So they could kind of play on the fear of the unknown. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=539.1199999999999s)]
*  Then once Donald Trump was president, and especially because Donald Trump is he is not [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=543.02s)]
*  presidential in the sense that he's not like every other president, like every other president [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=550.9799999999999s)]
*  has this thing in common that Donald Trump doesn't. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=557.48s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't care about, you know, politeness or like he just he doesn't play [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=562.44s)]
*  that whole game that almost every other politician was playing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=568.36s)]
*  And so during Donald Trump now, during the first term, also, you have these huge protests [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=573.28s)]
*  all around the country. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=579.64s)]
*  I mean, really, really dumb ones and some very violent ones later in his in his first [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=580.72s)]
*  term. But there's, you know, like, if you remember, like the the woman's march happened [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=588.36s)]
*  in early 2017. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=595.0s)]
*  It was like right after he was sworn in as when the women were wearing the vagina hats. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=596.9200000000001s)]
*  It was very bizarre. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=601.88s)]
*  But I mean, there were like hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=603.6s)]
*  Donald Trump was getting and college campuses. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=607.44s)]
*  If you can try to put yourself back in 2017, I mean, it was like just a wild environment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=610.28s)]
*  So there was all this kind of like upheaval. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=616.36s)]
*  There was all of this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=620.48s)]
*  It was like by its very nature, there was this departure from normalcy and into this [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=622.0s)]
*  new thing, you know, into whatever this is. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=629.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's pissing everybody off. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=632.28s)]
*  The media is freaking out. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=634.12s)]
*  You got the Russiagate story that really started getting traction. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=635.96s)]
*  So now people are watching CNN and MSNBC. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=639.32s)]
*  I know it's crazy to think about now, but people were watching CNN and MSNBC because [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  they were alleging that like the biggest scandal in U.S. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=646.76s)]
*  history was going on right now. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  Russia had hacked our democracy and installed Donald Trump. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=650.6s)]
*  And so there's just like it's almost like if you could describe, look, even 2017, 2018, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=654.72s)]
*  2019, at the time, we would have described this as like we're at 11. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=663.16s)]
*  The level of hysteria was just crazy. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=669.6s)]
*  And then came 2020. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=672.8s)]
*  And you're like, oh, my God, if you thought we thought we were at 11, turns out we were [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=674.8s)]
*  at two. Now we're in this whole new world. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=678.36s)]
*  And OK, so you've just got all of this hysteria. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=681.72s)]
*  Then 2020 comes, you have lockdowns, you have the George Floyd riots, you have all of [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=686.88s)]
*  this. And by the end of 2020 and for all four years, essentially the corporate [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=692.04s)]
*  media and the Democrats were arguing that like, look, this is Trump. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=698.36s)]
*  Like we were kind of a normal country. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=705.8s)]
*  We had our problems. And now this guy just destroyed all of that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=708.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, and. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=711.68s)]
*  Even if you were somebody who was, let's say, like center, right, and you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=714.04s)]
*  probably maybe voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and maybe you liked him. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=719.88s)]
*  You were more you preferred him being president to Hillary Clinton. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=726.08s)]
*  Maybe you even preferred him being president to Joe Biden. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=731.28s)]
*  But there was a feeling and this was palpable at the end of of 2020 where there was [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=734.04s)]
*  just like a feeling of enough already enough. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=741.64s)]
*  And like even I think a lot of people who recognize that, like, OK, at least 50 percent, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=746.64s)]
*  maybe even a lot more than 50 percent of the problem is that these leftists are just [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  hysterical when Donald Trump does anything. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=757.1600000000001s)]
*  Still. We just don't want any more of this. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=761.0s)]
*  And so let's at least get somebody who doesn't make this part of the country hysterical. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=765.32s)]
*  And there was just this there was a feeling and this was not just a feeling, this was [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=770.2800000000001s)]
*  explicitly the pitch of the Democrats, particularly when Joe Biden won the nomination, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=775.16s)]
*  that it was like, let's get back to normal. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  And Joe Biden was kind of uniquely positioned to be able to sell that message in 2020. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=784.64s)]
*  He look, he was already on his way to being senile, but it wasn't nearly as bad as it [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=794.04s)]
*  got over the last the last couple of years. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  But Joe Biden could just be like, hey, I am a dinosaur. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=802.76s)]
*  I've been in the Senate for 40 years. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=806.92s)]
*  Like, you know what you're getting with me. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=811.12s)]
*  I was the vice president for four years. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=813.28s)]
*  I was a senator for many, many decades. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=815.08s)]
*  Like he in many ways represented what the American establishment for the last 35 years. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=817.44s)]
*  So in a lot of ways, the promise was a return to normalcy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=827.68s)]
*  And Joe Biden and his surrogates explicitly said this over and over again in many different [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=833.24s)]
*  ways, but they were very clear. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=836.96s)]
*  This is what they meant. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=838.32s)]
*  We can let's just OK, enough of this crazy new experiment in Trump. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=839.44s)]
*  Let's get back to normal. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=843.48s)]
*  And there was nothing more devastating to that argument than Joe Biden's four years as [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=846.64s)]
*  president. Because what I think every now look, not to be a little self-serving here, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=853.44s)]
*  but I was one of the people far from the only one. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=861.36s)]
*  But I was one of the people arguing for the first four years of Donald Trump's administration [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=864.5200000000001s)]
*  that like actually that wasn't the case as I think it was Michael Malice who had the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=870.1600000000001s)]
*  coined the term that Donald Trump was not the river. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=877.0400000000001s)]
*  He was the dam. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=879.96s)]
*  You know, people thought that Donald Trump was like like the corporate media's analysis [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=881.8s)]
*  was almost like Donald Trump had ushered in this new age of craziness. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=888.12s)]
*  Whereas our understanding, which was fairly obvious to me, but has kind of been proven [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=892.12s)]
*  true over the years, was that no, no, no, Donald Trump didn't usher in this craziness. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=897.8s)]
*  We went crazy. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=902.8399999999999s)]
*  And the result of that is Donald Trump. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=904.48s)]
*  Like, it's not it's not that Donald Trump came and changed the political landscape to [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=907.04s)]
*  the to the point that like there's this huge like populist movement. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=912.24s)]
*  It's that the establishment failed so bad for so many years that the American people [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  were so furious at the establishment that they were ready to just pick Donald Trump [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=920.9599999999999s)]
*  because he was the biggest middle finger they could find. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=926.16s)]
*  So in this scenario, you know, it's like Donald Trump isn't the fire. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=928.5999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump was the spark. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  But the issue was that the floor was covered in gasoline. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=936.92s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump happened to be the spark who came along. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=941.04s)]
*  But like when you had this situation, any spark could have set this thing off. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  So anyway, the four years of Joe Biden really just disproved the idea that if you [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=947.68s)]
*  remove Donald Trump, we return to 1985 or something like that. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=955.0799999999999s)]
*  If you get rid of Donald Trump, we go right back to whatever you think normal America [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=960.76s)]
*  is. The fact is that Joe Biden became the president for four years and nothing went [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=964.44s)]
*  back to normal. In fact, it got even crazier than it had been under Donald Trump. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=969.32s)]
*  And so there was something it's like the American people were so furious with the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=973.9200000000001s)]
*  establishment that they were willing to vote for Donald Trump and make him the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=980.32s)]
*  president in 2016. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=984.96s)]
*  And then the American people were so frustrated with the craziness that they were [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=986.8800000000001s)]
*  willing to give the establishment one more shot. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=991.36s)]
*  And then Joe Biden blew that hand. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=994.6400000000001s)]
*  And so now it was like now, by the end of four years of Joe Biden, Donald Trump [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=998.36s)]
*  actually felt like more of a return to normalcy than another four years of this [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1003.24s)]
*  insanity would be. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1008.72s)]
*  And so anyway, I say all of that to say this is why Donald Trump has his highest [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  approval ratings and this is why he was able to give that speech that he gave last [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1017.5600000000001s)]
*  night. This is why he was able to be as successful as he was with the speech, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1023.36s)]
*  which I really do think there's no I mean, look, man, like people in the corporate [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1027.56s)]
*  media and people in the liberals and leftists who hate Donald Trump and there's [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1031.32s)]
*  still plenty of them. They can try to spin this any way they want to. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1037.6s)]
*  But this was just a huge win for Donald Trump. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1040.32s)]
*  I mean, in terms of, again, leaving aside the substance in terms of the effectiveness, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1042.88s)]
*  it was an A plus for him. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1047.4s)]
*  Let me ask you something, guys. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1049.04s)]
*  How well do you sleep at night? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1050.28s)]
*  Over the last few years, we've seen how wild things can get and we've seen how [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1052.0s)]
*  quickly the shelves can go bare when a crisis hits. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1055.28s)]

*  He was, you know, there's there's some areas for critique. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1113.8s)]
*  I think he went a little too long. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1118.56s)]
*  I think you could shorten these speeches. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1120.04s)]
*  But. Look, he had he had some great lines. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1123.72s)]
*  We got a couple of the clips played there, but there were some lines that were just [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1129.16s)]
*  killer, that were just like very like really hit home. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1132.56s)]
*  I don't want to give them away because we're going to play a couple of the clips, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1136.08s)]
*  but I'm sure you guys have seen a lot of them. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1138.16s)]
*  But I did think the when he was going through the Social Security [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1140.92s)]
*  and talking about the amount of people who are aged, you know, like he's like, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1145.36s)]
*  we had this many thousands of people who are between the age of 150 and 159. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1149.64s)]
*  And he goes, he goes, it's a healthier country than I thought, Bobby. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1154.8s)]
*  It's just great, great line. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1158.52s)]
*  The Pocahontas thing will play in a second. Great. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1160.68s)]
*  He was just Donald Trump has found a way. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1163.64s)]
*  I think David Sacks said something to this effect. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1167.48s)]
*  But Donald Trump just threw out the speech. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1171.08s)]
*  It's like he's figured out. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1173.64s)]
*  And this was always something about Donald Trump that was this was true. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1175.2s)]
*  It's been true. It's why he's been president twice. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1179.16s)]
*  He's always able that the analogy that I used to give is that it was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1182.4s)]
*  it would almost be like you were at a poker hand [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1186.96s)]
*  or you were at a poker game and like the imagine almost like you could pick [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1190.84s)]
*  your hand and then there's like pocket aces and no one wants to play them. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1195.96s)]
*  And Donald Trump just comes along and he's like, I'll I'll play pocket aces. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1203.44s)]
*  Those are really good cards. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1208.24s)]
*  I'm quite happy to play those. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1209.92s)]
*  And for whatever reason, all of the establishment politicians, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1211.44s)]
*  many of this is because of their the pressure from donors, the pressure, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1215.2s)]
*  like their own constraints. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1219.2399999999998s)]
*  And there's several of them and not just the pressure from donors, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1220.84s)]
*  but like the pressure to be able to go through the revolving door [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1224.1599999999999s)]
*  and get some cushy job after you're out of politics or any of that stuff. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1228.36s)]
*  But they have these constraints. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1231.7199999999998s)]
*  And one of the rules is you're not allowed to play pocket aces. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1234.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump just didn't have those constraints. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1237.1999999999998s)]
*  So it was just I'll play them, you know, like [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  securing the border is like a wildly popular issue. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1242.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, what David Sacks said is that it was something along the lines of like [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1246.12s)]
*  Donald Trump was able to race to the 80 on every 80 20 issue. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1250.56s)]
*  You know, like it was like all of these issues that are like 80 percent [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1256.52s)]
*  agree with this 20 percent disagree. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1259.72s)]
*  Donald Trump would just consistently put himself in the 80 percent. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1261.64s)]
*  You know, it's like whatever like. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1266.0s)]
*  Dudes shouldn't be competing against high school girls in sports like [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1270.12s)]
*  just like the most common sense thing that somehow in this crazy [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1274.48s)]
*  last decade in America has become an issue that for whatever reason, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1279.2s)]
*  most Democrats, almost all of them are constrained from agreeing with. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1284.3999999999999s)]
*  Like they cannot do that. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1290.4399999999998s)]
*  But he can come out and just say it. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1292.48s)]
*  And then like most Americans can go, oh, yeah, right. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1294.24s)]
*  Obviously, we agree with that. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1298.08s)]
*  You guys take the 20 percent who don't agree with this [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1300.56s)]
*  and will take the 80 percent is the game that Donald Trump was able to play [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1303.32s)]
*  all night long. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1306.9199999999998s)]
*  He also I mean, he was sharp. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1309.48s)]
*  He was on point. He delivered the speech well. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1311.6s)]
*  Donald Trump usually is not the best at reading a teleprompter, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1313.8s)]
*  but he he really got it done. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1317.8s)]
*  And then it was like such a huge contrast [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1320.12s)]
*  where not only does he did he have an A plus in terms of effectiveness, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1324.52s)]
*  but like the Democrats, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1330.16s)]
*  they had an F minus in. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1333.04s)]
*  I mean, it was just like if I couldn't believe it. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1335.68s)]
*  You know, first of all, I've I've been watching state of the union speeches [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1339.04s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1342.32s)]
*  There has never been one quite like this in terms of how [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1344.04s)]
*  wildly disrespectful and childish the opposition party was. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1350.6s)]
*  I remember back with I can't remember which one it was, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1355.92s)]
*  but it was one of Obama's state of the unions when the Republican [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1359.4s)]
*  congressmen screamed out, you lie. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1363.0800000000002s)]
*  And Obama was saying something about how Obamacare [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1365.96s)]
*  would would not give health insurance to illegal immigrants. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1370.2800000000002s)]
*  And one of the Republicans screamed out, you lie. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1374.52s)]
*  And this was like a huge controversy in the media. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1378.72s)]
*  It was like, hey, man, like, you know, the norm is that you can clap [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1382.3600000000001s)]
*  or you could not clap. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1387.3600000000001s)]
*  You could even maybe boo at certain points, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1390.1200000000001s)]
*  but you don't scream out and heckle and call the president of the United States [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1392.76s)]
*  a liar like the entire corporate media was like, that is just that is bad decorum. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1396.68s)]
*  And that's just not right. This was like a controversy. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1401.48s)]
*  Donald Trump went in there. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1404.48s)]
*  He was getting heckled immediately. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  One guy had to be removed. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1408.08s)]
*  Others walked out there typically in a state of the union. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1409.92s)]
*  The way it would almost always be is that like [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1414.08s)]
*  on controversial partisan issues, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1417.4399999999998s)]
*  the opposition party wouldn't stand and clap for you. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1420.84s)]
*  But then if you just said something that was just like generic, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1424.84s)]
*  like everyone could get behind that, you know, then like everyone would clap. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1427.72s)]
*  Republicans would clap for Obama. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1433.1599999999999s)]
*  Democrats would clap for George W. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1434.76s)]
*  Bush, like that was just part of the state of the union. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1436.36s)]
*  If you said something that they were like, yeah, even we agree with that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1439.6799999999998s)]
*  The Democrats wouldn't clap at all. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1442.56s)]
*  They did not clap at all for Donald Trump the entire time. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1444.52s)]
*  In fact, it's very interesting what they did clap for, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1447.36s)]
*  which was continuing the war in Ukraine. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1450.32s)]
*  Anyway, we'll play that clip in a second. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1452.72s)]
*  But I mean, like they wouldn't even clap. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1454.68s)]
*  They wouldn't even clap for like he's like, hey, here's like a little kid [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1456.8s)]
*  with a life threatening illness. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  And he always wanted to be a cop. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1463.0s)]
*  So today we're going to make him a deputy secret service, blah, blah, blah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1464.6s)]
*  And we're going to give him a little badge. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1469.08s)]
*  And his dad picks him up and like [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1470.76s)]
*  the Democrats wouldn't clap for that. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1472.76s)]
*  They wouldn't clap for anything. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1474.84s)]
*  They wouldn't clap for the American who was returned from Russia, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1476.08s)]
*  who had been imprisoned by Russia, like the literal and and look on top of that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1479.56s)]
*  And look, again, I don't really these [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1483.8799999999999s)]
*  these I don't care about these stories. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1487.08s)]
*  I think it's kind of I always find it kind of in poor taste. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1489.72s)]
*  Every politician does it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  But I don't like it when they kind of like use someone [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1494.08s)]
*  who's going through a tragedy or something like that [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1497.2s)]
*  and then try to score political points off of them. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1499.68s)]

*  Peckling and hissing and booing and it's just very childish. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1561.36s)]

*  There were people in the libertarian party who did it when Donald Trump came. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1573.8799999999999s)]
*  Like, I totally understand. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1576.52s)]
*  If he says something you disagree with and you want to boo or what, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1577.6799999999998s)]

*  I really don't think it played well, especially when you have Donald Trump [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1590.0800000000002s)]
*  out there. And this really is look again, this is still Donald Trump's best quality. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1594.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. If you look at Donald Trump through his entire life, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1598.44s)]
*  the thing that's most impressive about him is he's the he's the best marketer, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1601.2s)]
*  the best self promoter in history. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1606.48s)]
*  There's just nobody like him became world famous from being a real estate developer. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1609.0400000000002s)]
*  What? Who the fuck becomes world famous from being a real estate developer? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1614.4s)]
*  Real quick. Think of famous real estate developers. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1619.0800000000002s)]
*  OK, you got Donald Trump. Give me five more. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1621.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is the most famous man who's ever lived. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1626.2800000000002s)]
*  His silhouette is more recognizable than Jesus's. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1629.3200000000002s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, like he's he's just X and he's great. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1633.44s)]
*  So what you have here is and the reason he's great is he knows how to create the optics. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1636.52s)]
*  He knows how to put on a show. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1641.3200000000002s)]
*  And so here you have Donald Trump at the height of his popularity, at least so far. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1643.2800000000002s)]
*  And here he is getting on the 80 side of every 80 20 issue. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1649.88s)]
*  And here are the Democrats being children. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1654.3200000000002s)]
*  Helpless to stop him anyway. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1659.52s)]
*  And just what we're going to we're going to scream till we get kicked out. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1661.8400000000001s)]
*  And then a bunch of us are going to walk out of the room. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  That's your ace in the hole. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1669.24s)]
*  I was just it was terrible. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1671.92s)]
*  And it's all look, there's one thing like I've talked about this quite a bit, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1673.8s)]
*  I'm sure, because it was really one of the major stories of the election. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1678.1200000000001s)]
*  But look, I used to say this when the Mises Caucus was taken over the Libertarian Party. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1682.1200000000001s)]
*  It was one of the reasons why we were successful. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1686.3200000000002s)]
*  This stuff, social psychology is a huge part of this stuff. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1688.3600000000001s)]
*  And people could dismiss like vibes or whatever. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1691.88s)]
*  But this is this is how politics actually works, whether you like it or not. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1695.12s)]
*  And believe me, I'm one of the ones who doesn't really like it. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1700.16s)]
*  I really wish that the way American elections [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1702.44s)]
*  and American like politics worked was that it was issues driven. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1707.52s)]
*  And like the merit of people's arguments about policy positions [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1714.08s)]
*  is what should determine who votes for who, you know, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1720.76s)]
*  and that should determine who the American people support, you know, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1723.96s)]
*  who has the best argument about how monetary policy is going to lead toward [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1726.96s)]
*  prosperity or who has the best argument for what foreign intervention [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1732.2s)]
*  we should be a part of or not a part of or what, you know, like, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1736.72s)]
*  I wish that was the way it worked. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1739.48s)]
*  I'm kind of a dork about this shit. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, but look, that's just not the reality. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1745.24s)]
*  It's just not true. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1748.04s)]
*  And everybody knows that everybody knows that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1749.32s)]
*  There are people all throughout this country. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1752.48s)]
*  I mean, there are people by the tens of millions [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1755.04s)]
*  who vote in elections passionately prefer one candidate to the other, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  like might hate that candidate's guts and love this candidate. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1766.8s)]
*  And they don't know anything about policy. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1770.48s)]
*  They've never read a book about policy in their entire lives. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1772.8s)]
*  Probably not even read like too many articles about it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1776.36s)]
*  Maybe seen a few shows on something once. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1779.48s)]
*  There are people that's just the reality of the situation. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1782.36s)]
*  So people get emotionally invested. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1785.08s)]
*  There's cultural forces. Right. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1788.04s)]
*  What do you think? Red states stay red and blue states stay blue. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1789.9199999999998s)]
*  People vote the way their daddy voted, the way their grandfather voted, the way, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1792.8s)]
*  you know, like, that's just this is the reality. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1795.8s)]
*  And when you understand that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1798.2s)]
*  What Donald Trump was able to do throughout the entire campaign [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1802.48s)]
*  is that he made the Donald Trump [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1806.96s)]

*  it was a night of entertainment for the people who went there. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1839.04s)]

*  He's going to take away democracy. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=1848.1599999999999s)]

*  This is my fifth such speech to Congress. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2086.48s)]

*  absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2094.8s)]
*  or applaud, nothing I can do. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2101.28s)]
*  I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2103.84s)]
*  wipe out entire nations or announce the answers to the greatest economy [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2109.5600000000004s)]
*  in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2115.48s)]
*  And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2121.0s)]
*  will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2126.96s)]
*  They won't do it no matter what. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2130.5600000000004s)]
*  Five, five times I've been up here. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2132.1600000000003s)]
*  It's very sad [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2135.4s)]
*  and it just shouldn't be this way. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2137.6400000000003s)]
*  Like, do you not do you see what I'm saying here with how brilliant Donald [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2150.76s)]
*  Trump is at this, not even saying you got to support him as president or, you know, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2159.84s)]
*  like his latest policies, there's plenty that I don't like. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2164.44s)]
*  But like, this is just like brilliant framing. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2168.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, you know, you ever been in like an argument? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2174.0s)]
*  It could be with like, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2176.5600000000004s)]
*  like your husband or your wife or boyfriend, girlfriend or just like a friend or something. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2177.96s)]
*  You ever have anyone call you defensive in an argument? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2181.76s)]
*  I'd be like, you're being very defensive right now. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2186.2000000000003s)]
*  And it kind of immediately like. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2188.6000000000004s)]
*  It just puts you on the back foot, like all of a sudden you're on your heels, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2191.1600000000003s)]
*  not the balls of your feet, because when you get called defensive, you, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2195.5600000000004s)]
*  like if that bothers you, you're kind of proving that you're defensive. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2200.2000000000003s)]
*  And then if you're if you don't think you're [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2204.6000000000004s)]
*  being defensive, you're being defensive. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2206.36s)]
*  You're like, I'm not being defensive. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2207.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a very defensive thing to say. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2209.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like just like a weird little like kind of like framing tactic that could [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2211.0800000000004s)]
*  kind of like make you go like, oh, you almost have to like force yourself to calm [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2215.1200000000003s)]
*  down and like very like phonily be like, I don't think I am being defensive. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2218.6000000000004s)]
*  But if that's how you feel, like it's just a difficult thing to deal with. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2223.76s)]
*  I mean, that's Donald Trump. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2227.0800000000004s)]
*  Look, think about this, right? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2228.6800000000003s)]
*  You have a president who's popular. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2230.04s)]
*  OK, just won a very big election, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2233.6s)]
*  took every single swing state and won the popular vote. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2236.32s)]
*  Then he's up here, almost everybody. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2239.96s)]
*  Oh, I mean, if you say again, make it 80 20, take out the 20 percent of people who [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2243.4s)]
*  hate Donald Trump the most, like, you know, the ones who passionately hate [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2250.7200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump and just think about the other 80 percent of the electorate. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2254.92s)]
*  Almost any of them would at least have something they like about. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2258.28s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2263.48s)]
*  They're like, you know, I do I do think there's a lot of waste and fraud [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2264.6400000000003s)]
*  in the government. That'd be kind of cool if we could cut some of that or, yeah, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2268.04s)]
*  illegal immigration. I mean, it's super majorities of the American people [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2271.84s)]
*  support nasty portations. OK, so it's not the the Joe Biden immigration policy [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2275.36s)]
*  is wildly unpopular. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2281.56s)]
*  Nobody, almost nobody supports that. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2283.4s)]
*  When we remove that 20 percent, you're down to nobody is supporting that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2285.32s)]
*  Say at least kind of like that. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2289.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, you might at least kind of like, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2290.88s)]
*  yeah, maybe we should negotiate a peace in Ukraine. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2292.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a popular policy. A lot of people like that. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2294.7599999999998s)]
*  And so even people who don't support [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2297.3999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump probably have like a few things that they like about him. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2299.56s)]
*  And think about how powerful it is for [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2303.24s)]
*  Donald Trump to get up there and say, listen, no matter what I do, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  these people are going to have the same reaction. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2310.8399999999997s)]
*  And then the camera pans to these people having that reaction. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2313.2s)]
*  Also, looking miserable, looking miserable. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2319.2s)]
*  Again, who wants to join that? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2323.96s)]
*  This is just such bad politics like who who wants to be a part of the miserable [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2327.44s)]
*  group, do you want to come up, do you want to come over here? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2332.68s)]
*  Like if there are two people and one person is inviting you to a party [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2335.72s)]
*  and the other person is inviting you to come be miserable with them, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2339.96s)]
*  who do you think might be more successful in that scenario? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2343.48s)]
*  This is what Donald Trump was able to do. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2348.44s)]
*  And the visual just works so well with what he's saying. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2350.7999999999997s)]
*  And the fact is that anybody being honest about the situation, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2353.3199999999997s)]
*  anybody being honest, knows however you feel about Donald Trump. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2357.6s)]
*  He's right about what he just said. He's right about that. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2362.08s)]
*  But the Democrats are going to treat him [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  like a unique evil, no matter what he does, no matter how successful it is. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2367.44s)]
*  They're going to call him Hitler and they're going to, you know, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2371.44s)]
*  they're going to boo and they're going to pretend that everything's falling apart [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2374.16s)]
*  no matter what. That just it [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2376.88s)]
*  it's like perfect framing and it's also true. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2380.48s)]
*  And so it gets that nice ring of truth. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2383.32s)]
*  All right, let's go. Let's go to the next clip and discuss this a little bit. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2386.56s)]
*  The media and our friends in the Democrat [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2394.04s)]
*  party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2397.08s)]
*  the border, but it turned out that all we really needed [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2402.32s)]
*  was a new president. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2406.3599999999997s)]
*  Thank you. The media. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2429.8399999999997s)]
*  I just like the image of this angry woman with purple hair. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2433.3199999999997s)]
*  Like, I don't know. I don't know. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2437.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm not trying to like, you know, hey, man, dye your hair [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2439.52s)]
*  whatever color you want to live your life however you want to. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2442.72s)]
*  But like in the game of politics, we are playing a popularity contest here. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2445.92s)]
*  That's what democracy is. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2450.56s)]
*  It's about like who represents more people or something who at least can get more [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2451.96s)]
*  people to think that they represent you and like what percentage you think that [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2458.24s)]
*  represents? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2464.16s)]
*  The party of angry purple haired woman. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2466.0s)]
*  Anyway, I thought the line was great. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2470.2s)]
*  I thought that was actually probably his most effective line of the entire speech. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2472.48s)]
*  There to say like, it turns out we didn't [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2478.8799999999997s)]
*  need new legislation, we just needed a new president really was powerful and [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2481.08s)]
*  kind of undeniably true. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2486.52s)]
*  Right. I mean, this is what was the Biden administration's campaign. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2488.48s)]
*  They campaigned on the idea that they wanted three and a half years into his [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2495.0s)]
*  administration after years of record high illegal entry into our country, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2500.48s)]
*  that three and a half years in, they wanted to solve the problem. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2508.2000000000003s)]
*  And they got this bill and they said it was a terrible bill. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2511.2000000000003s)]
*  But whatever, they're pretending it wasn't. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2515.04s)]
*  And Donald Trump told the Republicans not to vote for it. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2517.04s)]
*  So that's why it was Donald Trump who, you know, he is the reason why we couldn't [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2520.24s)]
*  solve. We really wanted to solve this problem, but we couldn't. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2524.24s)]
*  The problem is that Donald Trump hasn't gotten any immigration bill passed yet. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2526.72s)]
*  Everything he's done has been through [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2531.44s)]
*  executive fiat and border crossings are at all time lows. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2533.24s)]
*  Border crossings under Biden were at all time highs and they're now at all time [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2537.52s)]
*  lows. So, my God, the argument that the reason you couldn't solve the problem was [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2542.0s)]
*  because Donald Trump told some congressmen not to vote for it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2547.4s)]
*  That that just is not going to fly. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2550.76s)]
*  And, you know, this is something that I've talked about for years, but there is [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2554.6s)]
*  there's just no question that there's this is at least a huge part of the [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2559.52s)]
*  equation is that a lot of it's just about the signal you send. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2563.64s)]
*  You know, like when Donald Trump is up there talking all this shit about [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2567.28s)]
*  immigration, people tend to stop coming because they feel like, oh, we're not [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2570.76s)]
*  going to be allowed in, even if he hasn't even done anything to ramp up immigration [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2574.5200000000004s)]
*  enforcement. And he's done some things, but I'm saying even absent that that just [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2578.5200000000004s)]
*  word gets out. And then when the Democrats are saying, oh, you're such a Nazi for [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2582.2000000000003s)]
*  wanting immigration controls and then they get the presidency, everyone goes, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2586.1600000000003s)]
*  OK, it's open. They're going to take us now. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2590.0s)]
*  So they come in larger numbers. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2592.6000000000004s)]
*  There's other factors, too. Don't get me wrong, but that's a huge one. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2594.6800000000003s)]
*  And anyway, just a very effective, very effective line. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2597.6s)]
*  Yeah, I. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2602.36s)]
*  Look, I mean, there are things I could [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2604.48s)]
*  criticize, obviously, policy wise. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2606.04s)]
*  You know. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2609.48s)]
*  In terms of substance of the speech, I got to say, and I guess this kind of [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2611.4s)]
*  crosses over, but as I mentioned before, I thought I sent the Elizabeth Warren [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2616.04s)]
*  clip, but it's not even necessary. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2619.2400000000002s)]
*  But at one point, I mean, he was so great [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2620.84s)]
*  on the war in Ukraine and just how the killing has to stop. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2623.32s)]
*  And at one point, this is like the only moment or one of the only moments when [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2626.32s)]
*  the Democrats clapped at anything he said, think about how fucking stupid these [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2630.96s)]
*  people are, they they applaud when he said we've spent [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2634.7200000000003s)]
*  possibly up to 350 billion dollars on this war. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2641.1200000000003s)]
*  The Democrats started clapping. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2645.7200000000003s)]
*  They started clapping about how we've spent a war that's ending in a loss. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2648.2000000000003s)]
*  They were clapping that we spent so much money on it. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2652.76s)]
*  And then when he said, oh, you know, he kind of addressed that and was like, oh, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2656.16s)]
*  you guys are clapping. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2659.92s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2660.56s)]
*  I'm sure some of you want it to go on for another five years. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2660.7599999999998s)]
*  A bunch of Democrats clap for that and Elizabeth Warren clap for it. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2663.96s)]
*  And then Donald Trump, of course, because he's Trump, he hilariously called it out [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2667.2799999999997s)]
*  and goes, that Pocahontas is clapping for that as just laughter throughout the chamber. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2670.4s)]
*  Again, first of all, he's right on the policy. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2675.08s)]
*  He's right on the issue. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2677.48s)]
*  Not only just right on the issue, think about how insane it is or goddamn [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2679.04s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren to be clapping over this. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2683.2s)]
*  I also like I got to, you know, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2685.52s)]
*  don't get me wrong, because I feel this way about all politicians [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2689.08s)]
*  and I feel this way about all politicians when they're cheering on wars. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2693.4s)]
*  I just always find it to be the the most disgusting thing that a politician can do. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2697.32s)]
*  And particularly it's disgusting because like none of them are ever [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2702.92s)]
*  going to go fight in any of these wars and almost none of their kids are ever going. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2708.44s)]
*  Hey, Joe Biden, the one exception to that [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2713.08s)]
*  actually did have a kid go to the go to the war, but very, very rarely to any [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2714.8s)]
*  of these people, you know, they cheer on the wars because it's some other poor guy [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2719.1600000000003s)]
*  who's got to go die in it, not them. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2723.6800000000003s)]
*  And I just I personally feel like I mean, look, I know I'm not I might be a little [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2726.0800000000004s)]
*  bit old for to see combat, not in Ukraine, but in America, in the American military. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2731.48s)]
*  I'd be on the older side. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2738.2400000000002s)]
*  But I feel like I'm still an able bodied man. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2739.36s)]
*  And I just I could never imagine myself [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2744.6s)]
*  supporting a war that I wasn't also willing to go fight it. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2747.88s)]
*  Like if there if there was a war like that, you know, if an army invaded America, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2752.68s)]
*  I'd be willing to go and fight them like, fuck that. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2758.76s)]
*  I'm not letting a foreign military come take over my country. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2761.7200000000003s)]
*  And so I'd be fine advocating for that war. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2764.7200000000003s)]
*  But I'll be there with you. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2767.0s)]
*  But you just could never imagine [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2768.56s)]
*  like advocating for a war that you're not willing to yourself go fight it. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2770.6s)]
*  And I will say I feel this way in general about politicians [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2775.7200000000003s)]
*  that I just think it's disgusting. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2780.16s)]
*  They cheer on wars that they know they're not going to go fight. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2782.2400000000002s)]
*  And, you know, you've got these guys like like like Newt Gingrich or whatever. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2784.84s)]
*  And there's a whole bunch of them who like they got like a bunch of, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2788.16s)]
*  you know, what do you call it, a deferments when when they were trying to [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2791.48s)]
*  when they were drafting in Vietnam, like they dodged the draft. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2794.76s)]
*  But then they cheer for every other war. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2797.8s)]
*  I just think I think it's quite possibly like [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2799.76s)]
*  debatably the worst thing a human being can do. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2803.0s)]
*  I will say at the risk of coming off as a bit of a chauvinist, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2806.8s)]
*  but that's never been a risk that I'm too concerned with. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  I find it particularly appalling when women do it. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2813.5200000000004s)]
*  I just do, you know, maybe that's my version of like [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2817.44s)]
*  my body, my choice or something like that. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2822.0s)]
*  But, you know, like there'll be all these women. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2824.36s)]
*  I'm sure Elizabeth Warren would make the argument herself, right? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2825.6400000000003s)]
*  That like men should shut up about abortion because it's not your body. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2828.36s)]
*  Right. Like a man's never going to have to have a pregnancy. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2833.48s)]
*  So you should shut up about abortion. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2836.36s)]
*  Now, that's a pretty dumb argument because the pro-life argument for abortion is that [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2838.4s)]
*  it's on behalf of the baby. And so, you know, I can have an opinion on killing babies. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2844.48s)]
*  But. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2852.1200000000003s)]
*  However you feel about that, isn't there something it's like, you know, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2853.8s)]
*  the Ukrainian women aren't being conscripted. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2858.08s)]
*  They're not being forced to join this. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2860.6s)]
*  It's the young Ukrainian men. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2862.56s)]
*  I shouldn't even say young. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2864.2000000000003s)]
*  It's Ukrainian men who are being conscripted into this war, forced at gun point [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2865.2400000000002s)]
*  to go be in this meat grinder, to get killed over nothing, to go get killed [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2870.32s)]
*  by the hundreds of thousands so that you can negotiate an end to the war [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2874.96s)]
*  in a worse position than before all of these guys got killed. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2879.08s)]
*  It's like. And then for Elizabeth Warren to be sitting there cheering this on. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2882.52s)]
*  Yeah, let's keep it going for another five years. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2887.72s)]
*  It's just I mean, I don't know. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2890.92s)]
*  It's appalling. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2892.92s)]
*  for today's show, which is Sheath Underwear. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2896.44s)]
*  I've been telling you about them for years because they've been sponsoring [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2898.92s)]
*  the show for years. Sheath uses moisture wicking technology to create underwear [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2901.52s)]
*  that keeps everything breathable and incredibly comfortable for you downstairs. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2905.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm wearing a pair of Sheath Underwear right now, as I talk to you, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2909.96s)]
*  because I'm always wearing a pair of Sheath Underwear. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=2913.12s)]

*  a mayor, like running for mayor of New York City is a huge advantage to have the [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3078.88s)]
*  level of name recognition that he has. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3083.64s)]
*  And I'd imagine his fundraising ability, although I don't exactly know after he [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3085.7599999999998s)]
*  was on the outs with the Democratic establishment, where where he is with that. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3090.7599999999998s)]
*  I still imagine he's going to have a huge [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3095.08s)]
*  advantage in terms of [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3097.24s)]
*  recognition and fundraising. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3100.64s)]
*  So that, I guess, is is something on on his record. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3102.48s)]
*  You know, again, I guess you would hope I mean, he has such an awful track record [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3108.12s)]
*  as governor. It's not just like that. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3112.28s)]

*  locking the state down and lecturing everybody else about how they're going to [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3126.28s)]

*  He was he was robbing Americans of their basic liberties on the pretense of you [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3131.6800000000003s)]

*  And yet, I did, by the way, I did say this publicly. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3154.92s)]

*  But I, Andrew Cuomo, that's my next debate. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3161.8s)]
*  That's right. That's who I want to be about. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3165.44s)]
*  I took out Chris. I took out Fredo. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3167.32s)]

*  But I would. Oh, my God. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3172.12s)]
*  I would love that be the that would really be the achievement of my career. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3173.2s)]
*  But anyway, that's right. Don't hold your breath on that. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3178.04s)]
*  I don't think Andrew's going to agree anytime soon. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3180.2799999999997s)]
*  I guess your answer is I really I don't know. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3182.3999999999996s)]
*  I really hope that. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3185.52s)]
*  Oh, my God. My fellow New Yorkers. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3188.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I'm not I don't live in New York anymore, but, you know, I'm born and [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3190.9199999999996s)]
*  raised in that city. Guys, we cannot be this fucking pathetic. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3194.24s)]
*  Dear Lord. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3198.3999999999996s)]
*  Maybe the one of the positives is that he did make some enemies in the establishment, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3200.3999999999996s)]
*  so perhaps that'll that'll come back to bite him. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3204.04s)]
*  OK, next question. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3206.52s)]
*  I would like to hear your opinion on all the videos that are coming out from Ukraine [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3209.0s)]
*  showing what he is doing to his own people with conscription of civilians. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3214.72s)]
*  And why is none of this ever mentioned or shown on literally none of the world's [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3220.2s)]
*  Western media news, mentally ill people with Down syndrome put on the front to me [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3225.9199999999996s)]
*  is crimes against humanity. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3231.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, OK. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3233.96s)]
*  So first of all, I mean, I completely agree with you. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3235.6s)]
*  And this is, you know, as I've said for a very, very long time, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3238.0s)]
*  many decades now, or at least maybe not many. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3242.08s)]
*  But it's going on two decades now. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3245.2799999999997s)]
*  I've been saying, listen, man, the draft [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3248.12s)]
*  conscription is slavery. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3251.16s)]
*  And that's what we're talking about here. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3254.16s)]
*  And in fact, I think it's you could argue it's like the worst form of slavery. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3255.92s)]
*  You know, if I if I were to force you against your will to do my yard work [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3260.92s)]
*  and not pay you for that and, you know, and not allow you to leave, then I have [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3267.96s)]
*  enslaved you. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3272.92s)]
*  That's a hell of a lot better than forcing you to go kill or be killed. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3275.88s)]
*  Like, why is it? Why is it just like it's just like all these? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3279.8s)]
*  You know, there's like basic libertarianism, one on one stuff. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3282.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's like when somehow when the government does it, we're supposed to [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3285.2400000000002s)]
*  have some completely different moral calculation about it. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3288.6s)]
*  But like the conscription is not only slavery, it is the worst form of slavery, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3291.44s)]
*  enslaving somebody and then giving them the job of would be murderer or murder [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3296.36s)]
*  victim is just enslaving you to the most traumatic job. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3301.48s)]
*  It's fucking horrible. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3305.8s)]
*  And then God and the idea that a professed free society like America would ever, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3306.88s)]
*  you know, fund a conscripted army is beyond unconscionable. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3312.52s)]
*  Yes, it is a crime against humanity in the most basic sense. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3316.88s)]
*  And and and look, you're the other point that you make is a very important one. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3320.44s)]
*  Well, why is it that where do we see these images? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3325.36s)]
*  You know, you see them on Twitter. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3328.56s)]
*  You're not you're not seeing them on NBC News. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3330.88s)]
*  You're not seeing them on CNN. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3333.88s)]
*  You know, I mean, this is just like this is, you know, as much as all those people [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3335.72s)]
*  in the corporate media can talk shit about misinformation and all this stuff. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3339.84s)]
*  It's all a joke. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3344.7599999999998s)]
*  You only get the real information once you go outside of them. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3345.7999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, it's it's, you know. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3349.08s)]
*  Again, also, the funny thing is that the [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3353.2s)]
*  propaganda for so long was that the Ukrainians won a fight. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3355.12s)]
*  And then it's like, yeah, OK, do they? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3358.96s)]
*  The ones I'm seeing getting a gun put [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3361.92s)]
*  to their head and dragged off to the front lines don't seem to want to. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3364.0s)]
*  I don't think that those, you know. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3367.2400000000002s)]
*  What is it? I don't I don't think people [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3371.7200000000003s)]
*  with Down syndrome want to fight or at least not meaningfully. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3373.44s)]
*  I don't think they meaningfully consent to that. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3376.5600000000004s)]
*  It really is something like especially when you think about the fact that, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3380.6800000000003s)]
*  like, you know, some of these arguments that I've been in over the last few years, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3383.6000000000004s)]
*  so much of the like woke progressive shit where they'd say things like. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3386.96s)]
*  You know, like if if if a if a chick is [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3392.36s)]
*  drunk and hooks up with a guy, then she didn't meaningfully consent. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3394.6400000000003s)]
*  So that was rape. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3398.1200000000003s)]
*  If she regrets it later, it's rape because she didn't meaningfully consent. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3399.32s)]
*  It's somehow just like it was the guy with Down syndrome consenting to go join [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3402.92s)]
*  the army or any like do we care about these issues? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3409.2400000000002s)]
*  It's even slightly believe me, getting sent [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3412.88s)]
*  to the front lines to go take on the Russians is slightly worse than a hookup. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3415.0s)]
*  You regret. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3419.16s)]
*  I don't know. Is that too politically incorrect to say? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3420.2400000000002s)]
*  But yeah, so anyway, I completely agree with you. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3424.7200000000003s)]
*  Excellent. Excellent question. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3427.36s)]
*  OK, if you guys want, we got time for like one, maybe two more questions. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3429.7200000000003s)]
*  And then I will have to wrap up. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3434.52s)]
*  Got to got to head out to to Buffalo. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3437.04s)]
*  OK, Dave, Trump has done a lot, both positive and negative so far. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3442.8s)]
*  What are you looking for him to do over the next few years as your highest priority? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3449.4s)]
*  OK, well, I agree with that, that general assessment. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3455.88s)]
*  I mean, I think that. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3459.08s)]
*  There's. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3461.84s)]
*  OK, there's a lot of good things that could be done. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3464.48s)]
*  There's a lot of things that even need to be done, I would say. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3468.6800000000003s)]
*  And I'm not holding my breath for Donald Trump to do all of them. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3471.68s)]
*  I think that if Donald Trump, you know, if I were to use an analogy, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3474.8399999999997s)]
*  it's we are in a car doing 100 miles per hour, headed off a cliff. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3479.64s)]
*  And so if Donald Trump can slow that down. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3484.2799999999997s)]
*  At least that gives us some more time [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3489.44s)]
*  to where you get more possibilities and maybe we can wake up more people and maybe [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3491.68s)]
*  something positive can come out of that. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3495.8799999999997s)]
*  The you know, Donald Trump, if you really wanted to solve the problems [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3498.7599999999998s)]
*  in this country, you're going to have to have drastic cuts in government spending. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3503.96s)]
*  You're going to have to roll back the big banks and their grip over our federal [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3508.36s)]
*  government, starting with abolishing the Federal Reserve. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3512.7999999999997s)]
*  You're going to have to abolish three letter agencies. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3515.6s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's there's a lot that would have to be done. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3518.2s)]
*  I'm not expecting anything like that to come of Donald Trump's second term. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3521.24s)]
*  This is not it's not a realistic expectation. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3526.36s)]
*  What what I can realistically hope for Donald Trump is at least he's kind of [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3530.48s)]
*  he's gotten the conversation started about cutting and spending. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3536.64s)]
*  He's gotten the conversation started about what the government is actually doing [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3540.2s)]
*  with our money, how criminal it actually is. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3543.68s)]
*  We've already gotten kind of like a complete rejection of the corporate media. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3546.44s)]
*  And if he can end the war in Ukraine [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3551.56s)]
*  and not step on one of these tripwires, which really would be like. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3554.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, another disastrous war or something like that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3560.16s)]
*  And if he can be reasonably not too bad [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3564.3199999999997s)]
*  on other issues, then I think it will have been a tremendous success. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3568.0s)]
*  And I mean, that might be a low bar, but, you know, I'm grading on a curve here [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3572.04s)]
*  compared to every other president, and it's already better than any president [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3576.2s)]
*  of my lifetime by far, is really not even there's no comparison. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3579.9199999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, that's that's what I would say. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3584.64s)]
*  But the the real dangers are somehow him not following through with this Ukraine [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3589.48s)]
*  thing and escalating the war with Russia. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3596.28s)]
*  And then the other real danger, I think the more. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3598.2000000000003s)]
*  More likely. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3602.64s)]
*  Disaster is some type of war with Iran [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3604.88s)]
*  or some major action on behalf of Israel, allowing them to annex the West Bank [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3608.4s)]
*  going through with the ethnic cleansing in Gaza, something like that. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3614.6s)]
*  This could be a real disaster and really have the power to to undo all the positive [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3617.48s)]
*  gains that he's had so far. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3622.44s)]
*  So as long as he could just stay America [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3623.88s)]
*  first, not get sucked into any of these stupid wars, I think we'll probably be. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3625.64s)]
*  We'll probably be able to say that this was a successful administration, at least [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3631.64s)]
*  compared to what what realistically could happen. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3636.88s)]
*  There I see Natalie. Oh, you must have. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3641.6s)]
*  It's funny, I read it out of the chat and then you grab that same question. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3643.64s)]
*  OK, I'm going to have to wrap on that one, guys. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3646.56s)]
*  We will we'll catch you next time. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3650.28s)]
*  Listen, I will get the members only episode out this week. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3652.32s)]
*  It will not be at the normal time tomorrow. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3655.56s)]
*  But as soon as me and Rob get up to Buffalo, we will record one and get one out to you. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3657.76s)]
*  Do not worry. We won't miss that. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3660.96s)]
*  I still owe you a couple of members only episodes. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3662.1600000000003s)]
*  I will make good on those. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3664.2400000000002s)]
*  Also, this Saturday, we are doing our Zoom meeting for the the top tier [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3665.4s)]
*  subscribers, really looking forward to that. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3671.36s)]
*  They're always a lot of fun. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3673.44s)]
*  So I'll see you guys at that. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3674.48s)]
*  All right. Catch you next time. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3675.7200000000003s)]
*  Peace. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7byEoYKc3M&t=3677.1600000000003s)]
