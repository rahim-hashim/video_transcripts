# Dave Smith | Trump's First 100 Days | Part Of The Problem 1258
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. I am Dave Smith. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=90.0s)]
*  He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. How are you today? Good, sir. Oh, I kickstarted porch [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=102.2s)]
*  tour. I had a lot of brisket and I had a good time. Port store is in session. My friends, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=106.72s)]
*  where'd you have the brisket at? Oh, I had a double brisket day. First at some local [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=112.72s)]
*  spot, which was solid and then a Buc-ee's after my show when I was drunk and high. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  And let me tell you, I don't think the Buc-ee's sandwich was technically better, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=120.92s)]
*  but I might have enjoyed it more. You know, a lot of people won't double up on brisket in one day, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=124.56s)]
*  but I've always felt that's that's what separates Rob from the rest of these pretenders. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=130.24s)]
*  A lot of people have brisket in the morning and they're not going back for brisket later that same [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=134.68s)]
*  day. Not Rob, though. Well, me and you, buddy, we are the well, in a couple of days, headed out [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=138.6s)]
*  to San Diego to do the American Comedy Company, which I'm very much looking forward to. That was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=145.56s)]
*  just one of my favorite clubs that we did. What was it? I guess a year and a half ago or so now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  So really looking forward to being back there. Come grab some tickets if you're in the San Diego [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=159.48s)]
*  area. Comic Dave Smith dot com. That is the ticket link for you. And I'm hoping to walk around and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=163.24s)]
*  see some more homeless penises because they were truly impressive the last time I was out there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=167.96s)]
*  It was wild. And I remember, you know, I have not been, you know, I haven't shit. I'm even [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=173.08s)]
*  trying to remember when was the last time I was in Los Angeles. You know, I used to go to L.A. all [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=179.56s)]
*  the time. We used to do like we had a little Legion of Skanks residency there at the Comedy Store. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=186.12s)]
*  We used to do, you know, the New Year's Eve show every year. And for like three or four years in a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  row, we did it. And then Rogan's podcast used to be out there. So I'd go out there to do that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=198.92s)]
*  sometimes. I'd always like be out in L.A. a few times a year. And then since we stopped doing that, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=204.6s)]
*  I like almost never go. And, you know, during all the COVID years, L.A. was so crazy. Like I [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=209.64s)]
*  remember, I got an offer at one point to do a gig there, but it was when it was like you could only [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=215.16s)]
*  do 50% capacity. Like you couldn't sell out the room. They would only let you sell half the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=220.76s)]
*  tickets. And they said, just didn't make sense. And then San Francisco, I've never been to San [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=225.88s)]
*  Francisco since it's like deteriorated from what I've heard. I remember going to Hollywood in L.A. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=230.68s)]
*  Man, years ago at this point, but I was out in Hollywood and the homeless problem was like [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=244.28s)]
*  out of control. But San Diego was the one kind of California city where I would like [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  start up close rather than just seeing it from, you know, like on the news or whatever. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=255.88s)]
*  I had actually been, which was always the only way you can learn about anything. But it really was, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=261.4s)]
*  there is something like, I remember me and you talking about it quite a bit when we were out [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=267.24s)]
*  there last time. So you go to San Diego, first of all, like most cities in California, it's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=270.92s)]
*  stunningly beautiful. Just like an unbelievably beautiful, you know, California is an amazing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=277.8s)]
*  state. It's the sunshine state, right? Or is that Florida or California? California, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=284.52s)]
*  I think. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=289.64s)]
*  Or is that Florida? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=290.12s)]
*  Let's just go with it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  We get this wrong anyways. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=292.04s)]
*  Well, whatever it is. But California is like, it's like the most beautiful, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=292.52s)]
*  you know, like naturally the most beautiful area. And so you come, you know, you're in San Diego [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=297.08s)]
*  and it's just like the city's beautiful, the water's beautiful. You go in that downtown area, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=302.92s)]
*  it's like great restaurants, a lot of cool culture. There it's an expensive area. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=308.52s)]
*  It's, you know, people living there and eating there are upper middle-class people. And it's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=316.2s)]
*  like, everything's very nice. And then you just have these entire blocks taken over by homeless [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=320.2s)]
*  people. And I just, it, there is something about that. That is just profound. I don't know. It's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=325.64s)]
*  just like, you walk around there and you're like, there's something, it's a comment about like [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=336.6s)]
*  Western civilization, the United States of America, like just everything where you're like, how is it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  that you have all of this and you, and yet while you have all of this, the one thing you don't [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=348.76000000000005s)]
*  have, the one thing you can't muster is the, um, the courage to protect it and say like, no, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  we're not just going to let you come and ruin this. Like, what are you? And it's anyway, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=365.8s)]
*  it's just wild. And as we've talked about many times in the past, it's not an issue of like [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  having a heart or not having a heart. It's not an issue of being like cold and callous and just [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=374.6s)]
*  being like, fuck you, homeless people. You're on your own. It's like, it's a, it's weakness [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=379.48s)]
*  because it's not as if it's like helping the homeless people to allow them to live on the street. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=384.6s)]
*  You're not like, you know what I'm saying? Like it'd be, it'd be more humane to force them into [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  some type of facility than to allow mentally ill drug addicts to just lay on the concrete. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=395.79999999999995s)]
*  It's pure weakness and cowardice. And I don't know, there's just something really interesting [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  to me about that. Like it's like, come on, man. Can't like the men in this town get together and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=406.52s)]
*  be like, no, we're not taking this shit. Anyway, really looking forward to going back. But that is, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  that was my big takeaway from last time we were there. All right. So, you know, the thing I was [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=417.16s)]
*  thinking about a bit this morning, that I thought we would open today's show talking about a little [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  bit was that we are approaching, I think either tomorrow or the next day is Donald Trump's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  hundredth day in office in the second term that is. And I thought, you know, while, you know, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=438.52s)]
*  there's been a lot going on in the news in those hundred days, and there's been a lot going on for [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=447.56s)]
*  me personally in the last few weeks, that was kind of a good opportunity to kind of zoom out and assess [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=452.12s)]
*  the first hundred days. And then, of course, a big part of that story [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=460.12s)]
*  is what one of the things you sent me, Rob, for the topics for the show today, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=468.36s)]
*  is that in at least a couple of the more recent polls, Donald Trump's approval rating has [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  pretty drastically declined. I think there was a CNN poll and maybe a Washington Post one that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=479.72s)]
*  both had him at like 40 percent. This, of course, is coming only a few weeks or a couple months [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=488.44s)]
*  after he was pretty consistently having his highest approval numbers. Now, again, I'm not trying to, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=497.88s)]
*  like, you know, take all these polls with a grain of salt. I don't know exactly how accurate they [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=505.72s)]
*  are. I mean, clearly, as we've mentioned many times on the show before, there was something [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=511.56s)]
*  revealing about this last election cycle where the pollsters were constantly telling us this was a [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=518.12s)]
*  toss-up election, but yet all of the reporting since has indicated that the internal Democratic [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=525.9599999999999s)]
*  polls told you that Donald Trump was going to win every single swing state and the popular vote. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  So, as I've said for a while, it's like, hey, how come we can't get polling that's as good as [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=540.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris's internal polling, which is kind of bizarre. But regardless of that, I do think [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=545.24s)]
*  what they're measuring there is correct. Like, I'm not saying the numbers are exactly correct, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=550.76s)]
*  but I do think that Donald Trump enjoyed his highest popularity when he first came in and now [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=556.36s)]
*  he is right back to where he was or perhaps even beneath where he was in his first term. So, that's [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=563.16s)]
*  a kind of interesting development 100 days into this. What do you think, Rob? You could take it [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=569.64s)]
*  wherever you want to, but we're 100 days into this thing and it does seem like at least the hope for [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=577.96s)]
*  the potential of what this administration could be has now met the reality of the direction the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=585.24s)]
*  administration is going. What do you think? Well, firstly, I love his bravado because his last [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=591.08s)]
*  statement was, don't worry, the tariffs are going to cover every cost you've ever had and we're going [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=597.56s)]
*  to be bringing down prices because of all the money we're bringing in from the tariffs. To speak to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=602.1199999999999s)]
*  what Donald Trump has actually accomplished in his first 100 days, I've observed a lot of noise and [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=607.64s)]
*  chaos and incredible bravado statements from the administration and then the left overplaying how [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=613.56s)]
*  bad it is or what exactly he's up to. So, to give the quick snapshot, he did not end the Ukraine [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=620.68s)]
*  war in a single day. In fact, I don't know if he's walking away from it. I don't know if he's [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=626.04s)]
*  no longer going to engage in the peace process but isn't going to continue to send arms over to the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=632.04s)]
*  Ukraine. As a person who regularly follows the news, I don't even know what the next course [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  of action or steps being taken is there. In terms of border control, it sounds like they've actually [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=643.4s)]
*  gotten control of the border and that we do not have as many people coming into the country. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=648.92s)]
*  In terms of sending people out of the country, it's a bit of a mess. I don't think that they're [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=653.4s)]
*  deporting at higher rates and they seem to be having at least creating some news about mix-ups. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=659.56s)]
*  In the case of the Maryland man, that guy's from El Salvador and was returned to El Salvador. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=665.48s)]
*  I think that there's more of a problem with the due process with the Venezuelans that were sent [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=669.64s)]
*  there. But anyways, I don't know that it's been the most fluid process in terms of actually [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  engaging in the deportations. From an economic standpoint, the tariff policy, is he going for [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=679.48s)]
*  more tariffs? Is he actually even trying to create manufacturing jobs? At this point, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=685.0s)]
*  is it just tariffs other than preferred American industries? Are other countries blinking? Once [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=690.28s)]
*  again, a lot of noise. I don't actually know what's happening there but I think that's where [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=696.04s)]
*  he's actually losing the general public the most in two things. One is I think they wanted to see [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=700.76s)]
*  a bigger cleaning up of the deep state. DOJ apparently, I guess, did something with USAID [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=707.48s)]
*  but they haven't really sold me on that storyline and it's apparently over. I haven't heard a new [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=713.48s)]
*  thing from the administration of what they're doing to clean up the fraud in government. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=718.2s)]
*  USAID storyline's over. There's no new plan for fraud in government. Pam Bondi, Cash Patel, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=722.6s)]
*  and all the rest, I haven't seen them actually go after Donald Trump's enemies or what the deep [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=729.08s)]
*  state apparatus was. We seem to be given all the support that Israel continues to need [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=733.4s)]
*  and everything else is a person who daily follows the news as a job and reads a lot. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=739.4s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. That's my 100-day scorecard. People don't like the tariffs. They [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=744.52s)]
*  want to see the economy improved and they want to see some of the other things that Donald Trump [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=749.24s)]
*  said he was going to do actually get done. Yeah. Okay. I think that's a great assessment. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=753.4s)]
*  Just to add to that and maybe discuss some of the specifics there, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=761.8s)]
*  I've noticed this a lot. I'm sure you have too, Rob. There's always a tendency that all of us [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=770.12s)]
*  have to guard against sometimes to act like or to act as if what you want to see [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=774.52s)]
*  means it's also going to be popular. It's like, oh, Donald Trump would be... I see this all the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  time amongst hardcore libertarians. I remember I was kind of gently making fun of Nick Gillespie [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=789.96s)]
*  once because he had some post about how if Donald Trump dropped all the culture war stuff [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=798.12s)]
*  and focused on the fiscal insanity of DC, he'd have way higher approval. Yeah. Don't get me wrong. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=805.32s)]
*  I kind of agree with your point, but for us to just project this onto the world, you can't just [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=813.32s)]
*  pretend the world is the way you wish it was. I said to him, I said, yeah, no, I agree. I said, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=818.2s)]
*  Matt Walsh did okay with What is a Woman, but if he really wanted to sell some tickets, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=826.44s)]
*  he should make a documentary about deficit spending because that's really what gets people [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=831.72s)]
*  moving. It's like, okay, there is also real life. However, so while guarding against that, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm still kind of going to do the same thing here, but I think I'm accurate that I think that in a [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=844.2s)]
*  strange way, there is this disconnect between where Donald Trump's base is and where the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=849.88s)]
*  Donald Trump administration is. Or I should even add there, there's a disconnect between [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=859.24s)]
*  where Donald Trump's base is, where Donald Trump's rhetoric is, and then where the actual policies [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=863.72s)]
*  are. And I think where Donald Trump's base is, is that they have a burning, very well-deserved, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=870.44s)]
*  white-hot hatred for the ruling elite in the United States of America, that they correctly [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=879.24s)]
*  blame the establishment for ruining everything. I mean, just ruining everything from getting [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=886.2800000000001s)]
*  everything wrong, getting fiscal policy wrong, monetary policy wrong, foreign policy wrong, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=893.96s)]
*  all of COVID wrong, and lying, not even getting it wrong, but just lying about all of it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=899.0s)]
*  And there's also, I think, a very palatable recognition that severe crimes have been [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=905.0s)]
*  committed by the Biden and Obama administration. And now Donald Trump also with his rhetoric [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=912.28s)]
*  is pretty goddamn intense about this. Drain the swamp. Russiagate was a witch hunt. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=921.96s)]
*  Everything Donald Trump says goes along with this. And so that works really well [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=930.92s)]
*  on a campaign because your base hates the establishment, and then you're feeding them [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=936.84s)]
*  lots of red meat about how you're going to be a revolutionary type figure. But then when it comes [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=942.12s)]
*  down to the details, there's really nothing revolutionary about anything in this administration. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=947.56s)]
*  Now, there are certainly areas where it is preferable to the alternative, where he's a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=953.4s)]
*  little bit better than the other guys would be. In some areas, not all. But there's just something [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=960.3599999999999s)]
*  that's, it's a recipe to be left not satisfied. Because you know what I mean? Like what the base [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=968.1199999999999s)]
*  really wants is something more radical than this. I would also, okay, to get into a few specifics [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=976.28s)]
*  here. And again, this brings me no pleasure to say, but it does seem, so full disclosure [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=981.9599999999999s)]
*  to everybody, I've said this before on the podcast, right? But when Doge was first created, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=990.6s)]
*  I was excited about it because I went, well, if nothing else, I went, it's created. On the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=996.28s)]
*  campaign when Donald Trump was like, we're going to do this Doge thing and have Elon Musk be in [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1001.3199999999999s)]
*  charge of it. I was like, hey, if nothing else, this is going to get the ideas out there. And I [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1005.48s)]
*  think there's something really valuable in that. And I think there has been something very valuable [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1009.64s)]
*  in that. But at the same time, what I initially said was, was like, you know, this isn't a real [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1013.08s)]
*  government department. I don't know, it can't really do anything. It's, you know, the Congress [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1021.24s)]
*  is still going to appropriate the spending. And so that's what you got to deal with. And as I've [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1025.56s)]
*  said publicly, I try not to reveal too much about private conversations, but I had a dinner with [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1031.08s)]
*  the V.A.K. Ramaswami. This is back several months ago when he was still a part of Doge. And I [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1036.1999999999998s)]
*  expressed that feeling to him. I was like, yeah, this is really cool, but it sure is a shame. It's [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1043.08s)]
*  not a real government department or nothing. You guys can't actually do anything. And he was like, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1047.8s)]
*  dude, just wait. Me and Elon got some stuff that we're working on. And it did give me pause and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1051.96s)]
*  to go, hey, you know, have a little bit of humility. These are people who I think are much [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1060.12s)]
*  smarter and more successful than me. And hey, maybe they got some plans. There's a lot of brain [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1064.6799999999998s)]
*  power between the V.A.K. Ramaswami and Elon Musk and a lot of money and a lot of influence. And like, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1071.56s)]
*  hey, maybe they got something. So I tried to be kind of open to it. A hundred days in now. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1076.4399999999998s)]
*  And it pains me to say this, but it seems overwhelmingly clear that Doge failed. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1083.7199999999998s)]
*  Just none of this is live. I hope I pray to eat these words. I would. Nothing would make me happier [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1090.6s)]
*  than if I have to come back on the show at some point and go, I got that one wrong. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  They really did end up working out. But like, what are we talking about here? Two trillion dollars [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  in cuts. Where are those cuts? Spending is going up. It's not going down. There's no cuts. There's [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1108.1999999999998s)]
*  negative cuts. There's growth, you know? And so, yes, a lot of hay was made about [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1116.52s)]
*  mostly about unimportant things, if I'm being completely honest. You know, like the most amount [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  of noise was like they're funding transgender goat studies in Lebanon or whatever. And it's like, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1130.92s)]
*  none of that was really the, you know, like, OK, it's insane that we're funding all this shit. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1138.84s)]
*  It's insane that we waste all of this money. But it's never like they even really mainstreamed the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1143.48s)]
*  idea that like, no, we're fomenting coups in other countries against democratically elected [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1148.2s)]
*  governments or what, you know what I mean? It was like never like really got in to like the [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1155.4s)]
*  the true criminality of USAID or the National Endowment for Democracy or whatever. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1160.28s)]
*  And, you know, there was a lot of talk, but when it came down to it, Congress passes a CR [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1166.76s)]
*  that refunded like almost all the programs that Doge recommended cutting. And then Donald Trump [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1175.48s)]
*  is there to smear Thomas Massey for being against it. And so like, I don't know. So there so in [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1181.08s)]
*  terms of the Doge thing, kind of a complete failure. I do think that like you're absolutely [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1189.32s)]
*  right in what you said that that there Donald Trump has seemingly almost single handedly, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1195.24s)]
*  he has stopped the flow of migrants coming into the country. And that's a huge W. You can't take [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1203.32s)]
*  that one away from from the Trump administration that they get an A plus on in terms of just the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1209.0s)]
*  flow of people coming into the country. They get an A plus on going from the the highest ever to [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1214.6s)]
*  the lowest ever is pretty goddamn impressive. And, you know, OK, it was the highest ever a [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1219.72s)]
*  couple years ago, but still under the last administration. And so they get credit for that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1224.76s)]
*  But it is the more you look at it. I do think there's just like a lot of things, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1232.2s)]
*  a lot of things that Donald Trump is is doing that just aren't really what the base was looking for. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1237.24s)]
*  And I think that like in terms of like deportations, I think the issue that most Trump [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1245.64s)]
*  supporters had was like, look, we don't even know how many illegal immigrants there are in the [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1252.1999999999998s)]
*  country. There's something in the ballpark of 30 to 50 million of them somewhere in there. I think [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1257.7199999999998s)]
*  we don't really know for sure. And it's kind of like, hey, they don't have a right to be here. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1264.36s)]
*  They came here illegally and they should have to go. And then you have debates about like, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1268.1999999999998s)]
*  well, I guess we should start with the criminals, start with the gang members, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1272.28s)]
*  start with this and then figure out how exactly to do this. But like, there was never really [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1275.1599999999999s)]
*  like a consensus that like, yes, we should be deporting legal residents who oppose Israel [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1282.28s)]
*  or something like that. It just wasn't like really what they were all about. And I definitely think [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1289.08s)]
*  that like the, you know, that it was pretty clear while don't get me wrong, while there's a lot of [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1294.6s)]
*  Trump's base who support Israel, I don't think I think overwhelmingly the Trump base did not want [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1300.76s)]
*  any more of this military adventurism. And he's look, he's conducted like a pretty serious bombing [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1308.0400000000002s)]
*  campaign in Yemen here. I think there's been what the last report I saw was there were around, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1314.68s)]
*  I think 100 people killed in the last few days over this. And it's like, he never really sold [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1319.8000000000002s)]
*  this to the American people never really convinced had like a convincing argument of this is why we [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1326.0400000000002s)]
*  should go to war with Yemen. He's listen, as I've said before on the show, he does seem to have stood [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1331.72s)]
*  up to the Israelis to some degree about Iran, we could get into that a little bit more, because [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  there's some more updates on that. But it's constantly flirting with with another war with [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1343.24s)]
*  Iran. And there's just like, all of the craziness is back, you know, like all of the everyday he [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1347.72s)]
*  says a crazy thing, this and that, it just doesn't seem like there's, look, it doesn't seem like [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1354.92s)]
*  there's much of a payoff for what may be like people's most optimistic hopes would have been. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1362.04s)]
*  And then to your other point that you you mentioned there, I mean, at this point, it seems [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1369.16s)]
*  overwhelmingly clear that there will be no punishment for any of the crimes that were [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1374.52s)]
*  committed at the highest levels of government. We're not getting anything they're not, oh, well, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1380.52s)]
*  we'll release the JFK files minus all the redacted parts. Well, maybe release some of the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1386.8400000000001s)]
*  Epstein stuff minus anything that you'd really want to say. There's just kind of like, at least [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1393.24s)]
*  this is very true from my perspective. But I do think this is a part of the reason why you're [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1398.76s)]
*  seeing his approval go down is that it's just kind of like, people have their hopes up, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1405.48s)]
*  Donald Trump stoked that, like, really get your hopes up, because this is going to be something. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1411.32s)]
*  And then it's just kind of like, it's really more of the same in most of these areas. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1416.52s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, a brand new sponsor who [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1422.6s)]
*  we're very happy to have on board. And that is American financing. Prices for the last few years [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1427.24s)]
*  have been and continue to be high. And most people unfortunately have to reach for credit [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1432.84s)]
*  cards to cover bills. Credit card debt has reached an all time high and it's trapping Americans. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1437.56s)]
*  American financing can help homeowners pay off high interest debt by using their home's equity. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1443.32s)]
*  Their mortgage consultants are salary based. So there's no incentive for them to put you in a [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1449.8s)]
*  loan that doesn't make sense. Their customers save an average of $800 a month when they call [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1454.84s)]
*  and let American financing help them. They don't charge any upfront or hidden fees to find out how [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1460.76s)]
*  much you can save. You may be able to close in as fast as 10 days and you may be able to delay [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1466.52s)]
*  up to two mortgage payments, creating more savings upfront. They've helped hundreds of [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1472.68s)]
*  thousands of homeowners create meaningful savings and it's reflected in their reviews on Google. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1477.64s)]
*  Call them today at 866-886-2026. Again, on average, people just like you are saving $800 a month. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1483.4s)]
*  Plus, they may close your loan in as little as 10 days. Don't let the chaos of the economy get the [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1493.4s)]
*  best of you. Call American financing now. It costs you nothing to get started and you may delay two [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1499.48s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. I also think a lot of the bravado works really [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1521.5600000000002s)]
*  well in the election and there is a lot to be said for selling yourself to be in there. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1526.6000000000001s)]
*  And even if you do not, let's say you do nothing as president, but you just don't allow the [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1532.12s)]
*  Democrats to get back in office and continue to censor the internet or the other shenanigans that [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1536.52s)]
*  they were pulling of bringing people across the border. That's a bit of a win. There's a win in [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1541.8799999999999s)]
*  just place holding the office with the Republicans that the Democrats can't kind of do the worst of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1546.6799999999998s)]
*  their agenda and enact that upon us. When you're actually in office, bravado statements about what [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1552.52s)]
*  you're going to do when you can actually just be getting things done doesn't work anymore. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1561.4s)]
*  So for example, when you start telling me, oh, I'm running the next time again, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1566.1200000000001s)]
*  what does that do? Why do I even need to be involved in a conversation about whether or not [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1570.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's going to be a good third term president? Why does that matter right now? You [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1576.2s)]
*  got at least two years to go accomplish incredible things that all of a sudden there's a worthwhile [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1580.8400000000001s)]
*  conversation. Is Donald Trump the grand saver of the American Republic that we need to revisit [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1586.92s)]
*  third term presidents? There's no reason to have that conversation right now. In fact, it's just [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1593.0s)]
*  annoying to kind of throw out there. And even if it's just that you're trying to troll the Democrats [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1598.1200000000001s)]
*  into speaking about it, that's still just annoying because you're actually provoking the nonsense [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1603.0s)]
*  conversation. Or when you start telling me as you walked back all your tariffs that know the revenue [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1608.04s)]
*  coming in from tariffs, which as far as I understand, don't really they've mostly been [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1613.4s)]
*  walked back except for China and even that critical industries he started to kind of cave on. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1617.88s)]
*  So what how exactly are tariffs going to start bringing down prices for people? Or what is the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1625.0800000000002s)]
*  tax revenue that's coming? Or what is the tax savings that's going to exist for people? That [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1629.3200000000002s)]
*  sounds like nonsense. So I'm just saying once you're once you're in office nonsense bravado [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1633.16s)]
*  statements. Firstly, for me, just trying to decipher through the bullshit, if the bullshit's [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1637.96s)]
*  being initiated by Donald Trump, and then the media is overreacting to it, I'm still kind of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1644.1200000000001s)]
*  annoyed with Donald Trump because he's engaging in bullshit. You know what I mean? Like it's still [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1648.76s)]
*  kind of the starting point of it. But my broader point is just bravado doesn't really work when you [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1652.6000000000001s)]
*  actually have the tools to implement your policy, and you could just engage in good policy. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1660.68s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And you know, that's um, it's, man, there's so much bullshit around all of it, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  because there's, there's so much bullshit that comes out of the Trump administration. And like [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1673.0s)]
*  you said, the media always has their bullshit overreaction to it. But it's kind of but like, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1676.52s)]
*  look, there was a there was a bunch made about how the the NASDAQ had like, it's the worst April [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1681.8s)]
*  since the Great Depression. But then at the end of April, it recovered a bunch. And then there's [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1690.2s)]
*  all these Trump people being like, Oh, look, you wrote all these articles about how it was so [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1695.72s)]
*  terrible. But I bet you're not writing any articles now or whatever. And you're like, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1699.64s)]
*  Yeah, but what you guys are leaving out is that it was when he walked back the tariffs [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1703.08s)]
*  that it recovered. So like, no, that's not really I don't know, you don't get credit for that. You [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1707.64s)]
*  don't get credit for like, driving your car toward a tree and then swerving at the last minute and [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1713.24s)]
*  not hitting it. And being like, Look, everyone was freaking out about us hitting the tree. It's like, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1718.6000000000001s)]
*  yeah, because you were driving toward it. Like, that's why everybody was freaking out. And this [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1722.12s)]
*  isn't just the media freaking out. This is the markets freaking out. It's all like, like, I don't [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1726.1999999999998s)]
*  know what to say. Again, like we've covered this whole time, like, tariffs are bad economic policy. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1730.6799999999998s)]
*  If you want to make some 40 chess argument about how you can use them as negotiating tools, like, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1737.2399999999998s)]
*  okay, but that's not the argument Donald Trump's making. And it's like, Oh, did you see? Did I [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1742.12s)]
*  mention this on the podcast or something? Because Bob mentioned this, I think I may have told you [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1749.32s)]
*  this and like, when we were hanging out, but Bob Murphy just had the best take on this ever because [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1754.2s)]
*  there was like some, there was some like, you know, free trade verse protectionist debate. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1759.0s)]
*  And Bob Murphy was reviewing it and the guy who was debating on the side of tariffs, he, he mentioned [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1764.04s)]
*  this Abraham Lincoln quote. Did I mention this to you? On the podcast? I don't think so. So so he [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1770.36s)]
*  quoted Abraham Lincoln, leave all your feelings about Abraham Lincoln aside. But he, so he quotes [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1776.04s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln, and he had some quote where it was like, he goes, when we trade with the world, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1782.6s)]
*  we get the goods, and another country gets the money. But when we trade with ourselves, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1789.8s)]
*  we keep the goods and the money. And like, you could see where the like, in a way, there's like [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1796.12s)]
*  a nice ring to that statement, you know, like, you could see where like, if you weren't thinking [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1800.84s)]
*  about it too hard, you'd be like, that's right, we get the goods and the money or whatever. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1804.92s)]
*  And then Bob Murphy just goes such a great Bob, this is really as Bob Murphy at his best as a [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1809.0800000000002s)]
*  brilliant economist. And he goes, Oh, that's interesting. He goes, Hey, you know, the first [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1813.5600000000002s)]
*  thing Abraham Lincoln did in the Civil War was put a full blockade around the South. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1818.04s)]
*  I guess he was doing that just to get him richer. You know, I guess he was doing that just so that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1824.52s)]
*  they would keep the goods and the money, and they'd be even richer than being able to trade [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1828.92s)]
*  with the rest of the world. Or it's like, or no, he recognized that actually that makes you much [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1833.16s)]
*  poorer in order to do it, right? Like, we put a full blockade around Germany in World War Two, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1839.0800000000002s)]
*  put a full blockade around Iraq in the 90s, full blockade around Yemen. In the after the Saudi [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1843.72s)]
*  invasion in 2015, there's a full blockade around Gaza right now. None of these blockades are put [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1850.0400000000002s)]
*  there because they just want to make these people richer. Right? Like this is it's just like, no, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1855.3200000000002s)]
*  it's actually what everybody recognizes, including Abraham Lincoln in the Civil War, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1859.88s)]
*  is that they are trading with other countries who make certain products more efficiently. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1864.44s)]
*  And therefore that makes them wealthier too. So it's like, you know, but, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1870.68s)]
*  by the way, the statement's not even accurate. I had a phone call with the great Gene Epstein. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1875.0800000000002s)]
*  The other day we spoke for about an hour on the phone on tariffs. I downloaded a whole [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1880.1200000000001s)]
*  bunch of information. And Gene, I apologize if I don't relay this information with complete [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1884.0400000000002s)]
*  accuracy. But a lot of the money that we spend abroad then comes back into the United States of [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1889.08s)]
*  America when people buy our treasuries, I guess, in part, hold our dollars, although he wasn't [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1895.72s)]
*  saying that. But a lot of it just comes back into our stock market. I understand that the stock [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1901.48s)]
*  market's not everything. And maybe it favors the elites that have those holdings. But the idea that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1905.24s)]
*  we just can't like, even if you want to go with that, that is being true of, oh, we could just [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1911.1599999999999s)]
*  spend the money here and then at least the money stays here. A lot of the money that goes abroad [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1916.6s)]
*  ends up coming back here by way of investment. So the idea that we're just handing the other [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1921.08s)]
*  people the money and then it disappears from our economy, I don't even think that's accurate. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1925.8s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1929.3999999999999s)]
*  Without making any additional statement about, you know, the economics of tariffs or whatnot, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1930.12s)]
*  I'm just saying if you want, on that idea of we send the money out and then now that money's, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1934.6s)]
*  well, firstly, if they're just holding our dollars, then I guess that means we can rob them through [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1939.24s)]
*  our inflation and that helps us. And then if they send the money back here because they're [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1943.4s)]
*  investing in our companies, they're not really keeping the money. They're actually lending it. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1947.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. No, that's a very- [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1951.5600000000002s)]
*  We can just continue to buy from them. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1952.3600000000001s)]
*  That's an important point. But I think that, you know, like as you were making the distinction [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1954.3600000000001s)]
*  between like campaign rhetoric versus policy, there's, on the campaign trail, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1958.76s)]
*  Donald Trump would say things like, you know, it was always like the narrative was kind of like, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1967.72s)]
*  hey, the world is ripping us off. I know how to get them to not be ripping us off anymore. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1971.96s)]
*  You threaten them with a tariff. You hit them with a this and then they stop ripping us off [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1977.08s)]
*  and then we prosper more. He talked a few times about like eliminating the income tax. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1980.92s)]
*  Right now, just this week, he said that they were talking about eliminating the income tax [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1986.44s)]
*  for everyone who made $200,000 a year or less. The thing is that's not going to happen. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1991.56s)]
*  Again, I hope to be wrong about this. Nothing would make me happier than if income taxes were [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=1999.24s)]
*  eliminated on everybody making $200,000 or less a year. And nothing would make me happier than [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2005.0s)]
*  having to eat my words on this. But like, that simply is not going to happen. That's not on the [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2010.2s)]
*  table. And so what you end up getting is just the tariffs, not the tariffs replacing the income tax, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2016.2s)]
*  the income tax, and the tariffs on top of that. So it was something that you could sell [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2023.32s)]
*  on the campaign. But once you're actually in there, and what people all people see is the [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2028.76s)]
*  market doing poorly and prices going up and things like that, that's not going to be very popular. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2035.24s)]
*  And so, you know, look like I think Donald Trump, like, the way I viewed it, this is what I said on [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2041.0s)]
*  Rogan's podcast on the election on the I was going to say the election night, but it was the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2049.08s)]
*  day after the election. It's like Donald Trump had a mandate in three very key areas, like a [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2055.16s)]
*  real genuine mandate. It was to deal with the illegal immigration crisis, to get the economy [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2063.88s)]
*  turned around, and to keep us out of foreign wars. Like those were the areas where it was like super [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2072.04s)]
*  majorities of the American people were behind that agenda. And he succeeded on one of them, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2078.68s)]
*  you know, but he really has not succeeded at the other two. And I think that's pretty much what [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  explains his approval numbers going down. By the way, I'm still rooting for the Trump administration. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2093.24s)]
*  I still don't regret supporting them. I think it's clearly preferable to the alternative, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2098.9199999999996s)]
*  at least as of now. Obviously, a major calamity could change that. But, you know, we got to be [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2105.24s)]
*  honest about these things. And I think that's about where we are. And big polls, they all love me more [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2112.2s)]
*  than they ever loved me. Here's going to be the 51st state. We're going to own Greenland. No one's [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2119.7999999999997s)]
*  going to be richer. Sure. Just do something. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and you also made just a very good [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2124.2s)]
*  point that there is something there is just something about the optics of 100 days and [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2131.3199999999997s)]
*  talking about your third term and how we're going to like, you know, completely change all the rules [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2137.72s)]
*  to give you a third term where it's like, dude, you got to succeed with term number two before like, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2143.3999999999996s)]
*  look, let's just be real about this. Okay. Donald Trump's first term ended in 2020, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2149.24s)]
*  the worst year in modern American history. And he's 100 days into his second term, like, dude, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2155.48s)]
*  before, first of all, also, like, let's be brutally honest here. Donald Trump won all the swing states [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2161.7200000000003s)]
*  and won the popular vote against Kamala fucking Harris. He had Joe Biden at the beginning of the [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2168.44s)]
*  race and Kamala Harris at the end. These are like the two worst candidates. You know, if you, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2175.4s)]
*  and I mean the saying 2024, Joe Biden was a substantially worse candidate than 2020, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2182.12s)]
*  Joe Biden, who wasn't great either, but 2024, Joe Biden was substantially worse. Kamala Harris [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2187.0s)]
*  was like the worst candidate the Democrats have ever fielded for president. I mean, like [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2192.44s)]
*  just horrible. So you beat them. It's like, dude, like, it's not such a given that you'd win a third [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2196.52s)]
*  election. Let's see where we're at. But there is something very weird about like, like the move [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2203.24s)]
*  is to do so great that your base starts going, Hey, how the hell do we get a third term out of this [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2209.96s)]
*  guy? It's not to just you as your approval numbers are falling, start leading with like, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2217.2400000000002s)]
*  I should do this again. And, and, you know, look, I, the other thing that you mentioned there that I [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2223.56s)]
*  do really think is worth me agreeing with is that, and this is part of not the only reason, but it is [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2228.84s)]
*  part of the reason why I still do not regret voting for Donald Trump is that look, there is, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2238.92s)]
*  there was a humongous cultural impact of Donald Trump winning this election that was very good [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2244.84s)]
*  for the country. And part of that was the fact that you're like, yeah, you, you didn't allow [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2253.88s)]
*  these Democrats to take power. And I really, I don't think it's unreasonable for people like [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2258.12s)]
*  me and you specifically, Rob, to have been very concerned about the censorship that might have [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2265.08s)]
*  happened under a Kamala Harris presidency. I mean, there was unprecedented levels of censorship and [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2269.72s)]
*  attempted censorship in Joe Biden's four years. And if they came in and got kind of a mandate, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2279.4s)]
*  like, yes, we saw these four years and we're giving you another four years, which is essentially what [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2285.32s)]
*  keeping the vice president, you know, the vice president winning the presidency would have been. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2289.88s)]
*  I don't know what that environment looks like for guys like me and you, you know, it's like, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2293.8s)]
*  particularly also because we are not flying under the radar nearly as much as we were during the [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2298.92s)]
*  last rounds of Syria censorship. We're, we're a much bigger show and much more in, you know, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2307.0s)]
*  in the public conversation. You know, I said this, I was talking about this on Saturday, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2316.1200000000003s)]
*  we did our, I do like a monthly Zoom call with the people, the top tier subscribers at part [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2323.0s)]
*  of the problem.com. It's a great group of people that we have there. I really always enjoy it very [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2330.52s)]
*  much. If you want to get in on that, go sign up over at part of the problem.com. I was kind of [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2336.04s)]
*  talking to them about it because, you know, we do it every month. So this was the first time we did [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2342.84s)]
*  it since all this stuff with my debate on Rogan and all this stuff has happened. And so we were [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2346.52s)]
*  talking about it and like one of the things I was saying, I've been thinking about this quite a bit [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2350.76s)]
*  because I remember, you know, if, so like I got on, I got on Joe Rogan's podcast for the first time [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2354.84s)]
*  in 2016. And I think then I did again in 2017. And like, this is kind of like when I started [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2361.48s)]
*  building a little bit of an audience and I remember always being very concerned. And then through [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2369.88s)]
*  the years, you know, we've, we've talked about both of, obviously are part of the problem in [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2374.92s)]
*  our circle. Facebook group got booted and you had major problems with your YouTube channel [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2379.72s)]
*  during COVID. And there was always this kind of concern that it was like, well, listen, like, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2385.16s)]
*  it's, it's like, you're growing and you're trying to get bigger and bigger, but you're flying a [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2390.8399999999997s)]
*  little close to the sun here. And at a certain point, like they'll come for you and they'll, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2395.24s)]
*  they'll censor you. And this used to be the way it worked. And, you know, you could get [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2400.6s)]
*  the treatment that Alex Jones or Milo Yiannopoulos or Gavin McInnis or like all of these people [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2406.04s)]
*  just got shut down. Now, I mean, of course, Alex Jones survived it and is still there. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2412.12s)]
*  Gavin and Milo, I think to a smaller extent, I think they were really impacted by their [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2417.24s)]
*  cancellation and unfair, very unfairly, very unfairly. I mean, like in the Milo example, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2423.3199999999997s)]
*  it was like, do you remember they got him for the most ridiculous thing ever. They got him for [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2429.64s)]
*  opening up about being abused. I don't think he would have called it that, but like it was insane [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2433.88s)]
*  anyway. So that was always a major concern. And one of the things I've been thinking about over [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2440.76s)]
*  these last few days, while there has been this kind of, there's been, you know, you can call it [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2447.08s)]
*  whatever you want to. And I'm not trying to make myself out to be like a victim here or something [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2454.92s)]
*  like that. Because I'm not, I don't feel like I'm a victim. I actually feel quite safe. I hope I'm [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2459.32s)]
*  not being naive in saying that, but I feel quite safe actually where I am right now. But there's [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2464.1200000000003s)]
*  been an attempt to like attack my reputation in a way that I've never experienced before with really, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2469.8s)]
*  you know, big figures writing pieces and all of the, all going at me. And it's not like they're not [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2478.52s)]
*  overtly calling for me to be censored, but it does seem like the only logical conclusion is that [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2484.84s)]
*  they're calling for Joe Rogan to not have me on the show anymore or something like that. But [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2489.7200000000003s)]
*  the thing I've been thinking about a lot is just like that. I'm so lucky that this happened now, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2495.4s)]
*  you know, like I'm so lucky that we're kind of in the situation we're in now where Elon bought [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2501.96s)]
*  Twitter, where Zuckerberg bitched out, where YouTube kind of decided they don't want to do [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2507.1600000000003s)]
*  this anymore. And that whole censorship regime has kind of receded. And now I'm in the environment [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2513.0s)]
*  where I'm like, you know, the, for the moment I was the talk of the who's, you know, spreading [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2519.0s)]
*  misinformation or whatever they say. But like, that is, you know, look, I think that's a big [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2524.52s)]
*  deal for the country. I don't mean to just make it about myself, but like for me personally, it's [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2531.8s)]
*  like, Hey, I think Donald Trump winning was a huge part of this. And so like, I'm, I'm, I'm not [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2535.96s)]
*  unappreciative of how important that is. The other thing that's also made me appreciate is like, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2542.2s)]
*  how brutal it must have been for those people who were the victims of those cancellation mobs in [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2551.64s)]
*  those days where they could really get you, where they could just get you. And then it was like, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2557.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh dude, like, okay. Yeah. You have the freedom of speech. You can keep saying whatever you want to, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2562.2s)]
*  but you don't have a Twitter account, a YouTube account. You can't be on iTunes. You can't be on [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2567.24s)]
*  Facebook. You can't be on Instagram. You know, it's like, Oh, you're, you're pretty effectively [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2570.7599999999998s)]
*  removed from the conversation. And I, while I still am dealing with like the kind of like, whoa, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2575.4s)]
*  there's a lot of people, you know, talking about this. It doesn't have the teeth to it. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2584.92s)]
*  At least it seems again, I could be wrong about this. I really hope I'm not wrong about that one, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2590.2799999999997s)]
*  but it does, but there is something kind of different there. And Donald Trump winning isn't [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2594.84s)]
*  the only aspect of that, but it certainly is a major one. And so I wouldn't want to, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2598.92s)]
*  I wouldn't want to downplay that. And that's much more important than just me, obviously. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2603.96s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Brunt. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2608.84s)]

*  what should we, what, what do you want to go to here, Rob? Oh, do you want to, you know what, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2687.96s)]
*  this is just as we were, we're talking about this stuff. What's there, there's also kind of, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2692.6800000000003s)]
*  I've got a clip here of Rachel Maddow that I did think was pretty funny because it kind of demonstrates [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2699.0s)]
*  the whole thing that we're talking about. It's kind of on topic where it's like, you know, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2704.36s)]
*  it's like there's the Trump craziness, but then there's the reaction to Trump from the media, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2707.96s)]
*  which is like 10 times more crazy. So it makes him seem less crazy somehow. But here was Rachel [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2712.2s)]
*  Maddow being interviewed about kind of her take on the first hundred days of, of Donald Trump's [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2717.8s)]
*  second administration. Let's, let's play this clip. Was there some profound failure of imagination [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2724.6s)]
*  on our part that we did not reasonably anticipate how effective Trump and his cabal of doers would, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2730.8399999999997s)]
*  would be. And the reason why I say that is they destroy, they wreak havoc. Can you just pause it [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  already? Pause it already. Dude, Rob, just think about the framing of this question is like this [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2744.2799999999997s)]
*  is where MSNBC is, right? So they're talking Trump's first hundred days, right? Here's Rachel [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2752.12s)]
*  Maddow on Trump's first hundred days. So we just did a whole topic of this, right? But imagine this [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2757.3199999999997s)]
*  is where MSNBC still is. There's still go, did we just not fear monger enough? Was that, was the [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2762.8399999999997s)]
*  problem that we just didn't realize how bad it would be? And that is that amazing, Rob, that that's [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2771.24s)]
*  still their takeaway. Not that we overplayed our hand and therefore couldn't talk about the very [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2777.4s)]
*  real issues with Donald Trump, but maybe we didn't, maybe we weren't alarmist enough is where MSNBC [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2783.0s)]
*  is. It's dude, it's, it's so like reminiscent of 2017, 2018, where the dynamic is always like, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2790.76s)]
*  you almost want to be pissed off at Donald Trump, but then you see the corporate media and you're [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2797.88s)]
*  like, nah, you know what? Fuck you. I think I'm back with him. It's just too crazy. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2802.68s)]
*  Imagination is a very funny word from a journalist. We have spun more outlandish stories. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2808.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Right. All right. Let's keep playing. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2816.04s)]
*  Cause so much damage. And then they're told that's illegal. They're told you can't do that. They're [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2820.04s)]
*  told that that is wrong. And we see that, right? But the damage has been done. And then you have [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2824.3599999999997s)]
*  people like us citizens that are now being held in prison. I mean, it's these types of things that [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2829.96s)]
*  really make me wonder, did we again have a failure of imagination? Can you just pause again? You said [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2835.0s)]
*  I actually look at it. I think, you know, I, I, we haven't played a mainstream, uh, like a news clip [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2841.2400000000002s)]
*  on the show in a while. And, uh, I don't see as many of them in my Twitter feed. I've been consuming [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2848.04s)]
*  as much mainstream media as of late. It really lacks any specifics whatsoever as to what the [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2853.16s)]
*  havoc is. And, um, the, if you're one single example is the El Salvadorian who has sent back [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2859.64s)]
*  to El Salvador. Not that I say that that was necessarily the right decision. I actually have [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2865.72s)]
*  mixed feelings on that one because he is El Salvadorian. It just lacks any specifics whatsoever [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2870.52s)]
*  of what exactly is the havoc? What exactly is the defiance of law? I mean, a lot of these lower [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2876.12s)]
*  courts will end up getting overturned that would try to, I don't think regional judges should be [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2882.2s)]
*  able to, um, really hold back. Uh, you know, I think there needs to be like a secondary Supreme [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2885.96s)]
*  Court that almost, uh, um, or these cases need to get to the Supreme Court quicker. I don't really [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2892.92s)]
*  think liberal, um, local judges should be allowed to, uh, you know, counteract the, uh, the president's, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2898.28s)]
*  uh, the president's policies, particularly if the matters seem to be more political than they are [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2904.68s)]
*  legal. Uh, but in this case, it's just such a nonsense claim where she doesn't give a single [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2909.96s)]
*  specific other than one instant, which is one guy that's not wreaking havoc on a country. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2914.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's also the way she said her actual words were that we have American citizens [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2920.04s)]
*  sitting in prison and you're like, yeah, we have lots of American citizens sitting in prison. Like, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2926.44s)]
*  no, I know who was living in Maryland. Who's not American citizen. Right. Right. But so it's like, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2935.88s)]
*  no, there's a case of a non citizen who, and that is very debatable whether that was the right move [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2940.76s)]
*  or not, but like, that's not, but like, it's just an American citizen in prison. It's like, yeah, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2947.0s)]
*  dude, we have the biggest prison population in the world. Like, yes, we have lots of American [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2952.1200000000003s)]
*  citizens in prison. What are you talking about here? Like it's like you said, there's just no [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2955.88s)]
*  specificity. Excuse me. That's there. There's no specifics here. Um, it's like, again, yes, it's [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2959.4s)]
*  not the problem is like, it's always in a weird way and perhaps even intentionally, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2966.92s)]
*  some conspiracy theorists might, might, uh, speculate, but the, the media always in their [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2973.7200000000003s)]
*  own weird way cover for Donald Trump because there are these things to be critical about, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2981.4s)]
*  about how he kind of like really isn't doing so many of the things that he promised that he ran on, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2986.6800000000003s)]
*  but instead all they can do, it's like all they're capable of doing is shrieking catastrophe. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=2992.52s)]
*  That's it. This man wore a blue suit at a funeral. Yeah. Yeah. It's just everything's gotta be. Yeah, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3000.6s)]
*  something like that. Yeah, right. He wore a blue suit to the Pope's funeral. My God, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3007.16s)]
*  that really is wreaking havoc on the world. All right. Let's keep playing. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3011.96s)]
*  Um, the, uh, the other way around, I feel like, um, the kind of pundit common wisdom heading into [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3015.8s)]
*  Trump's second term was that, um, the comparison with the first term, um, or that the, the difference [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3023.6400000000003s)]
*  with the first term was going to be that he was going to be more efficient. He was going to be [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3031.8s)]
*  better at doing what he wanted to do. And that's what we should brace ourselves for. And I actually [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3037.0s)]
*  don't think that's the way it's worked out. I think that he is definitely more ambitious in [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3041.72s)]
*  terms of the kind of radical change she wants for the country. I do think we're in the middle of an [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3046.6s)]
*  attempted authoritarian overthrow of American democracy. I mean, I think everybody who predicted [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3051.08s)]
*  that was right, but I don't think he's any better at it. Um, I mean, you just think about the litany [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3055.4s)]
*  of mistakes, things that they acknowledge. I mean, just, you really cannot overstate. It's [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3061.4s)]
*  unbelievable because not like it's the same thing we used to say back in the day when we used to [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3070.68s)]
*  pay attention to this more, when we used to always play the clips of Brian Stelter, um, that you would [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3075.3199999999997s)]
*  just go like, yo, they kid, they never even attempt to look in the mirror. They never even attempt to [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3080.2799999999997s)]
*  go like what, you know, like, look, dude, like even, you know, if you, um, let's say you, your [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3085.7999999999997s)]
*  marriage fails, you know, you get a divorce, even if you want to sit there at like, let's say you [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3092.8399999999997s)]
*  were married to someone, they were shitty to you. They were awful. They did a lot of bad stuff. The [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3098.84s)]
*  marriage ends up failing. Like at some point you'd have to look in the mirror a little bit, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3103.6400000000003s)]
*  but maybe not at first. Maybe it takes a little bit of time. You know, we're now it's, it's, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3112.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, we're going into nine years since 2016. You know what I mean? Like it's been a while. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3117.2400000000002s)]
*  It's almost a decade since their major like upheaval of Donald Trump winning when they all [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3124.1200000000003s)]
*  said he couldn't, but like even in the marriage example I was giving, like even if it was like 90 [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3128.52s)]
*  on them, on the other person you were married to, like at some point you'd be like, all right, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3135.24s)]
*  well like 10% of it was on me. Like I could have done this better and this better, you know, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3140.04s)]
*  you just like on some level they are just like incapable. Rachel Mano looks back and goes, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3143.96s)]
*  yeah, all the people who said ended democracy have been proven right. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3149.72s)]
*  There were, we're witnessing an attempted authoritarian takeover. It's like, you don't [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3153.48s)]
*  have to be, you could make a claim like that and then not have to be specific. I mean, like, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3159.72s)]
*  like I remember, um, as, as I've said many times when I, when I debated Chris Cuomo, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3167.0s)]
*  there was one point where I referred to lockdowns as totalitarian and then he went, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3172.92s)]
*  yeah, that's just hyperbole to call them totalitarian. And then I responded by being [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3179.72s)]
*  like, no, listen, here's the situation that we're describing. Okay. Americans were waking up every [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3185.72s)]
*  morning to watch their governor on TV, to find out what they were allowed to do that day down to the [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3192.4399999999996s)]
*  most intimate details of like, can I have a funeral for my father? Can I go to work? Can I go work out [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3198.8399999999997s)]
*  at the gym? Can I go to my place of worship and worship with my, my, you know, like fellow, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3204.36s)]
*  you know, uh, Christians or Jews or whatever. It's like, I'm sorry. If we were looking at that [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3209.48s)]
*  on paper, that is clearly totalitarianism. Now you could argue that the totalitarianism was justified, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3214.2000000000003s)]
*  but if that's not totalitarianism, then the word has no meaning, you know? So it's like, okay, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3220.2000000000003s)]
*  you could throw out like a provocative claim like that. But as we all know, at least all honest [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3225.08s)]
*  human beings, the more provocative the claim is, the more you have to be able to back it up with [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3231.4s)]
*  very specific details, you know? She just throws that what the fuck is anyone even talking about? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3236.76s)]
*  Like, I'm just like, um, you could be against some of the deportations. You could be against [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3244.52s)]
*  some of the policies, whatever, but like, to just throw this out, like all those people who completely [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3248.52s)]
*  lost the day. Like, I mean, think about this, right? You had everybody in the corporate media [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3254.12s)]
*  saying, if this guy wins, it's the end of democracy. And then he was democratically elected. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3259.16s)]
*  So like the voters rejected your argument and you're just going to say they won the day because [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3265.8799999999997s)]
*  we are witnessing it without backing it up in any way. Like this is the perfect cover for Donald [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3272.2799999999997s)]
*  Trump is people like this. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3278.52s)]
*  show, which is Tax Network USA. Tax Day may have passed, but for millions of Americans, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3283.96s)]
*  the real trouble is just beginning. If you've missed the April 15th deadline or still owe [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3289.8s)]
*  back taxes, the IRS is ramping up enforcement. Every day you wait only makes things worse. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3294.28s)]
*  With over 5,000 new tax liens filed daily and tools like property seizures, bank levies, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3300.04s)]
*  and wage garnishments, the IRS is applying pressure at levels we haven't seen in years. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3306.2s)]
*  Increased administrative scrutiny means collections are moving fast. The good news, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3311.16s)]
*  there's still time for Tax Network USA to help. Self-employed or a business owner, even if your [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3316.6s)]
*  books are a mess, they've got it covered. Tax Network USA specializes in cleaning up financial [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3321.7999999999997s)]
*  chaos and getting you back on track fast. Even after the deadline, it's not too late to regain [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3327.3199999999997s)]
*  control. Your consultation is completely free and acting now could stop penalties, threatening [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3333.0s)]
*  letters, and surprise levies before they escalate. Call 1-800-958-1000 or visit them at tnusa.com [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3338.52s)]
*  Smith. You may have missed April 15th, but you haven't run out of options. Let Tax Network USA [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3347.8s)]
*  help before the IRS makes the next move. All right, let's get back in our show. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3353.24s)]
*  Any thoughts on that, Robert? You want to jump back in? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3359.56s)]
*  Let's jump back in. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3361.4s)]
*  All right. Right out of the gate, they tried to cut off all federal grants for everything. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3363.0s)]
*  And then within 48 hours, I had to take that back and say they didn't mean that. Remember Trump's [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3370.2000000000003s)]
*  big thing about like, I've turned on the water in California. And immediately the Army Corps of [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3374.0400000000004s)]
*  Engineers was like, yeah, you just wasted all of the water that we had saved in reservoirs for the [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3379.6400000000003s)]
*  summer season. You know, the accidentally firing the Ebola prevention workers, accidentally [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3385.7999999999997s)]
*  firing the nuclear weapons people, accidentally firing the bird flu people, all of this stuff that [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3393.16s)]
*  they have done and then undone. It does reflect the radicalism and their ability and willingness [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3397.7999999999997s)]
*  to just destroy. But they haven't done a lot of it on purpose. They've done a lot of it despite [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3405.08s)]
*  themselves. And their incompetence is not a blessing. A lot of people glibly say like, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3410.28s)]
*  oh, you should have enemies that are this incompetent. They'll fall down. You don't [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3417.8s)]
*  have to trip them. But their failure has created wreckage in the US government. It just means that [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3420.76s)]
*  they're not that good at doing what they're actually trying to do. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3426.6800000000003s)]
*  All right. Do you want to take a stab at this nonsense, Rob? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3432.84s)]
*  Well, I just want to start with the inaccuracy for examples. From what I remember of the [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3437.64s)]
*  California water was that a lot of it gets dumped into the ocean to preserve some fish. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3445.4s)]
*  And Donald Trump was criticizing that policy of dumping water into the ocean. And then on [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3450.3599999999997s)]
*  the avian flu, I don't remember Donald Trump specifically firing and then rehiring the avian [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3457.48s)]
*  flu team. But there was a storyline of that there was massive culling of chickens, which is what [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3465.08s)]
*  drove up the egg prices and whether or not Biden's policy for culling chickens was a good policy. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3471.08s)]
*  The nuclear engineer ones, I believe is actually accurate. I think that in the Doge thing, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3479.16s)]
*  they hired some staff and realized, oh, we actually need that staff. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3484.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3487.3199999999997s)]
*  But I don't see a lot of I don't see a lot of slash government spending or programming [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3488.52s)]
*  that has resulted in a failed state now of chaos. And so firstly, her list of examples sound like [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3495.9599999999996s)]
*  very small and specific to the four that she listed there sounded inaccurate. Are you endorsing [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3504.12s)]
*  Biden's policy of culling the chickens and driving up egg prices? Do you think that water has been [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3510.6s)]
*  well managed in the state of California and that Trump's specific water policy has created a problem? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3516.6s)]
*  And so I mean, the other two examples, I just don't remember what she just said. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3524.2799999999997s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like we're in a state of chaos because of and by the way, I don't think [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3529.08s)]
*  Donald Trump's great at governance. And I think that's the issue that he's having right now. So [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3535.08s)]
*  I kind of agree with her theme. But the hyperbole of that Donald Trump has rolled back government [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3538.52s)]
*  programming. And now we're in a state of chaos. I just don't think is very accurate of what's [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3544.28s)]
*  happening in the country. Yes. Also, there is. Yeah, I 100% agree with you on that. It's also [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3548.92s)]
*  just her point is totally confused. Like it's like they they want to do all of this radical harm, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3556.2000000000003s)]
*  but they're so incompetent that they can't do all of this radical harm. But that doesn't actually [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3563.2400000000002s)]
*  make it any better because it's their incompetence that is doing all of this radical harm. It's all [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3567.8s)]
*  just ridiculous. And the other thing I got to say here, which is, you know, okay, I'm taking this [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3572.76s)]
*  back to libertarianism 101. But, you know, that's a really good class that everybody really should [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3579.48s)]
*  have to take. It really should be a required class. I know there's a little contradiction [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3586.0400000000004s)]
*  there. It should be forced by violence for you to take libertarianism 101. But there are the idea [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3592.2000000000003s)]
*  that somebody is attempting an authoritarian takeover and the means by which they want to do [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3601.32s)]
*  that is to cut the size of government is retarded. That is just absolutely ridiculous. This has never [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3609.88s)]
*  happened once in the history of the world. This is not the way authoritarian, authoritarian takeovers [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3621.0s)]
*  work. Nobody has an authoritarian takeover. And step one is to give themselves less power. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3627.88s)]
*  It's just totally ridiculous. And the idea that it's like, no, you could you could make some [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3637.32s)]
*  argument if you wanted to, that Donald Trump is attempting to cut government down to the bones [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3642.2000000000003s)]
*  or something like that. And that we think that will have a negative outcome. Now, I don't think [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3649.4s)]
*  that's a particularly good argument. And there's lots of things that would jump right up at you as [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3656.52s)]
*  a big, you know, red flag that you've got that all wrong. Like number one, like if Donald Trump [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3661.88s)]
*  really was, I mean, Rob, me and you wish that were actually the case. But like, Donald Trump, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3666.84s)]
*  there's a lot of power of things Donald Trump has to do that he's not doing. Donald Trump could have [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3673.64s)]
*  vetoed the continuing resolution. He didn't have to sign that into law. He could have vetoed that [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3680.6s)]
*  and say, no, get me get send me a budget that has serious spending cuts in it. I mean, he's got a [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3687.24s)]
*  majority in both houses of Congress. You know, like, I'm just saying, like, like, if you want to put [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3692.52s)]
*  on and this is part of the thing that will actually make you furious with Donald Trump is to go, if [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3697.56s)]
*  you want to run the counterfactual and go, imagine Donald Trump was just a little bit better. There's [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3701.3199999999997s)]
*  a lot of areas where it's like, oh, yeah, he really could have done that. And what could, you know, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3706.92s)]
*  especially when he was coming into that vote with record high approval ratings, and he's coming off [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3711.88s)]
*  this huge win, and he's become, you know, the cool kid and like, whatever all of this stuff. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3718.04s)]
*  And he's the most popular Republican by far in the country. It's, it would have just been I mean, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3724.28s)]
*  amongst Republicans, at least, it would have just been like, there was a huge opportunity where he [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3731.64s)]
*  could have put so much pressure on the Congress to be like, well, what are they going to do? What [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3738.12s)]
*  are the Republicans going to not do that? And also, oh, it would have been so powerful, because man, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3742.8399999999997s)]
*  he could have called their bluff, because there's not a single Republican who hasn't ever said on [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3748.04s)]
*  record that they're for smaller government. So what would you, you know, it wouldn't have been [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3754.2799999999997s)]
*  on one of the divisive issues that some Republicans disagree with him on or something like that. It [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3759.16s)]
*  would have just been like, no, we're actually cutting government this time. This is the moment. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3763.7999999999997s)]
*  Everyone's talked about it and not done it. I'm the best. I'm terrific. We're going to, you know, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3767.16s)]
*  do it in your dumb Trumpian way, whatever. He could have, but he didn't do that. He, in fact, was [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3771.3199999999997s)]
*  smearing the one Congressman Thomas Massie, who stood up against the insanity. So he's told, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3779.0s)]
*  so it doesn't, you know, that, but again, that wouldn't even if it were the case that Donald [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3785.48s)]
*  Trump was trying to cut government in drastic ways, which it's not, I wish it was, but even if that [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3790.28s)]
*  were the case, that wouldn't be an authoritarian takeover. That would be the opposite. That would [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3795.88s)]
*  be giving more power to the people and less power to the central government. That's not how authoritarian [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3801.0s)]
*  takeovers work. What the fuck are you talking about? This is so, it's so unbelievably stupid. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3808.68s)]
*  All right, listen, we do got to, got to wrap up there because I got to run. Thank you guys very [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3816.7599999999998s)]
*  much as always for listening. Come see me and Rob out in San Diego. Looking forward to this one. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3823.16s)]
*  All right. Have a good one. Catch you later. Peace. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxTW0MLpkQ&t=3828.2799999999997s)]
