*  What's new with you Rob? How's your how's your day going so far? I got some new sketches out [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=120.5s)]

*  At gmail.com. We're putting it together. It's nearly the season of porches almost the season and the season of porches [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=131.42000000000002s)]
*  It's like elections. It gets longer every year like every year the porch season goes a little used to just be a few weeks [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=137.1s)]
*  In summer now, it's most of the year now. It's if there's not ice on your porch [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=142.94s)]
*  Rob will come set up a comedy show there for you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=147.78s)]
*  And by the way people just unbelievable the feedback of Rob's porch tour people love it great shows [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=150.9s)]
*  Okay, so there's a there's a few things that I wanted to talk about today [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=157.7s)]
*  And I think we'll probably start with with bricks which was the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=163.62s)]
*  The clip that you sent Rob [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  This you know sometimes with the stuff we cover like, you know [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=173.66000000000003s)]
*  And yet when you're covering the news and you're always covering what's going on lately. It does like [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=177.62s)]
*  It's a weird thing. Like when you get lost in the day-to-day news, it's like there's this new event [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=184.18s)]
*  But then they all start forming into patterns and they could almost be categorized categorized and like, okay throw it into this column and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=189.82s)]
*  this column is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=198.42s)]
*  For me personally one of the most infuriating it's the column of people coming out way too late and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=201.38s)]
*  telling the truth about kovat when it's like I [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=210.5s)]
*  Don't know it's just particularly infuriating to me and I'm sure to you too as somebody [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=213.62s)]
*  Rob who was telling the truth about kovat as it happened and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=218.82s)]
*  Kind of taking all the arrows that come with that. It's it's true [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=222.94s)]
*  It's a it's a special type of enraging when you see people who? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=227.62s)]
*  Had the biggest platform and all of the credibility come out now in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=232.9s)]
*  2025 which by my [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=239.06s)]
*  Mathematical reasoning is five years after we needed to hear this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=241.22s)]
*  but [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=245.98s)]
*  When they come out now and then it's almost like they just try to blend into the crowd [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=247.18s)]
*  You know what? I mean? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=251.22s)]
*  like it kind of feels like if you were like in a third world country and your [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  Dictator is horribly corrupt and you're outside and they're yelling like we want to end this corruption of this brutal [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  Dictator this regime is put and then you look next to you and it's the dictator [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  And he's also yelling and he's also like yeah down with this guy and you're like wait no [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=268.98s)]
*  You are the guy you don't get to be on our side now [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=275.14s)]
*  Anyway, it kind of gives me feelings like that. So that's one. It's an entire category. We've probably done [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=278.86s)]
*  You know a hundred different videos that are different topics that have fallen into this category, but I'll just preface [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=284.5s)]
*  It's another one of those this one is so [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=290.58s)]
*  Irritating because if you wanted to give me a little bit of a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=294.42s)]
*  Irritating because if you wanted to give a one-minute summary of my position on the kovat vaccines [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=297.44s)]
*  It's what you're about to hear from this lady [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=302.88s)]
*  And it's five years too late [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=304.88s)]
*  And when you were saying it at the time you were being pulled down from the internet [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  Now you might be a little bit of variation in that. I also talked about you know, the emergency authorities government was seizing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=310.76s)]
*  But in terms of just the vaccine [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=317.88s)]
*  This is nearly exactly what I was saying five years ago in two sentences [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=319.88s)]
*  Except coming from one of the people that was responsible for everything that was not this information five years ago and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=325.12s)]
*  Not that me or you are high profile enough that this woman by the way [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=332.44s)]
*  The woman we're talking about is a dr. Bricks Deborah bricks. I believe I think it's to Bora. Okay. Well, yeah, whatever [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  God even her name infuriates me. Just call it Deborah. Anyway, um [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=344.44s)]
*  She was her title she was like the head of Donald Trump's coronavirus [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=348.92s)]
*  Response she was on that the kovat task force. She was [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  Burks, I'm sorry. Maybe I'm saying it wrong [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=361.56s)]
*  she was she was on TV every single day with Fauci and her and Trump and you know, like they were the face of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=364.6s)]
*  the kovat [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=372.44s)]
*  response and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=373.88s)]
*  You just wonder right like I was saying like it's not that me and you are such a so high profile or something like that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=375.4s)]
*  But like when you were saying it's like the same thing with Cuomo, you know when he comes out and says like oh [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, Ivermectin is not horse dewormer [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=388.0s)]
*  It's it's medicine and I'm on it right now and blah blah and but but he says it with no [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  Acknowledgement that he was demonizing people who said this at the time and with no [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=394.64s)]
*  He says it almost as if he just figured it out like the rest of us have it like hey Rob [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=398.64s)]
*  You know, I just figured out we shouldn't have fought the war in Iraq. Yeah, I just came up with that my own like this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=404.06s)]
*  That you know what? I mean like there's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=408.22s)]
*  Anyway, what would this chick have said about you if? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=410.86s)]
*  Just played a video clip of you saying this at the time when it really mattered and you just know the answer [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=415.42s)]
*  She would have demonized you in the most vicious way. Anyway [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=421.66s)]
*  Here's a clip. She was on you gotta say to Pierce Morgan man [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=425.42s)]
*  And I do you know look up I know I have called it the Jerry Springer of political commentators before [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=428.44s)]
*  I got to say and I said this is someone who's a regular guest on the show [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=435.2s)]
*  It is really amazing what he's built [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=441.52s)]
*  It's very straight. It's it's just at a certain point. You're like, oh you get like [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=445.36s)]
*  you get the head of the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=450.64s)]
*  Coronavirus response on your panel and then they're just arguing it out with other people anyway [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=453.12s)]
*  It's pretty wild that he's able to book some of the people he books [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=457.74s)]
*  But let's let's go to the clip and then we can we can respond [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  He made it very clear to every mom out there that his children were immunized about childhood vaccines [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=465.28s)]
*  And what we've done wrong in public health is we didn't explain that COVID vaccines were nothing like the childhood [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=471.96s)]
*  Vaccines and that the childhood vaccines like many of the diseases you get it once you don't get it again [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=479.52000000000004s)]
*  And this is getting the children to have that disease without getting the deadly consequences [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=485.92s)]
*  That is not what the COVID vaccine was designed to do [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=491.96000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't designed to forget against infection and if you look at the vaccine hesitancy rates, they've doubled since COVID [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=494.94s)]
*  So we have to start addressing these things. We can't just [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=503.0s)]
*  Ask you let me ask you Deborah, I mean given that you were the face of Kobe from the Trump presidency at the time [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=507.14s)]
*  Do you share this doctor who I was with you share the concerns about the longer-term? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=514.42s)]
*  negative impact of some of the Kobe vaccines [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=520.54s)]
*  The messenger RNA vaccine should have been rolled out for the people that were at risk for severe disease [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=524.74s)]
*  Because that's what the disease that's what the vaccine was developed for [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=531.22s)]
*  But when we say that we're following the science and the data [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  We need to follow the science of the data and the science and the data said people primarily over 65 or people with significant [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=538.3s)]
*  comorbidities were at risk for severe disease [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=546.1s)]
*  Those are the individuals that should have been immunized first and we should have put our science behind our immunization [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=548.78s)]
*  Schedule and protected those most at risk [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=556.22s)]
*  It went into young people in hospitals before it went into our elderly and nursing homes [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=558.9399999999999s)]
*  That is not following the science and the data [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=564.58s)]
*  so I am all for following the science and the data, but it shouldn't just be a [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=567.18s)]
*  Statement it should be a reality and when we don't match what we do in public health to the science and the data [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=573.58s)]
*  That is when we get into trouble and that's when we start to fracture trust with the American people. I [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=579.66s)]
*  Mean I didn't it is it's just amazing to watch dude [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=586.98s)]
*  It's amazing it is the dictator getting out of his palace and joining the protesters and just be like, yeah [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=591.42s)]
*  I know this is okay. I remember [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=598.42s)]
*  Being on this little show called the Joe Rogan experience where me and Joe literally said that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=600.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean really he said it which is what caused the storm not me so much [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=608.5799999999999s)]
*  But we were just talking about how like yeah [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=612.38s)]
*  We don't really think that young healthy kids need to take this vaccine and I said like there's no way I'd give my kids [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=613.9399999999999s)]
*  This vaccine and then Joe was like, yeah, like if you're young and healthy [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=620.5s)]
*  I would just recommend you be really healthy exercise and literally the president of the United States of America [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=623.94s)]
*  Ripped into us for having this conversation said we were spreading dangerous misinformation [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=631.02s)]
*  Fauci said it was dangerous misinformation and now quietly [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=636.34s)]
*  years later four years later the chick who was the face of the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=641.14s)]
*  Covid response goes. Oh, yeah. No, that's what following the science looks like. It's like hey, well, where were you at the time? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=646.5s)]
*  Like we could have used your backup [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=653.7800000000001s)]
*  It would have really been nice to be able to point to the head of the coronavirus [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=655.9000000000001s)]
*  Response and be like look even she is saying we're following the science here and you're not [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=660.94s)]
*  Then it's just these years later [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=665.86s)]
*  And and by the way, Rob one of the things that strikes me about that is there's nothing that she's saying here [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=667.7800000000001s)]
*  That's like new information has come out [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=673.18s)]
*  She's saying at the time [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=676.9s)]
*  This is what we all knew like we knew that the mRNA was not designed to prevent infection [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=678.42s)]
*  Really? Well, you didn't think it was necessary to speak up while the that was the entire sales pitch of it [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=685.06s)]
*  The entire sales pitch from Fauci and Biden and Rachel Maddow and the entire regime [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=692.3399999999999s)]
*  Was that you will not get kovat if you get this that right Rachel matters [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=697.5s)]
*  It stops with you and now you can't transmit it to the next person [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=701.9s)]
*  This was their whole pitch [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=706.22s)]
*  This was the pitch Fauci made as he went door to door trying to convince people in Baltimore to get the damn thing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=707.58s)]
*  It's just amazing to see I'm sorry. This is like not good enough and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=714.14s)]
*  There should have been [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=718.7s)]
*  Then I'll confess I haven't seen the whole episode but like how is there a follow-up question to this? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=721.1s)]
*  Which is like why didn't you say this at the time? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=727.44s)]
*  Why wasn't why you know like what how can anyone in the scientific community even complain about anything? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=730.5799999999999s)]
*  That's going on now [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=737.18s)]
*  If you guys it wasn't incumbent on you to all stand up and say this at the time if this was obviously what the science [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=738.26s)]
*  Was that yeah, yeah, you know, it might make sense to get like the very, you know severely at-risk population vaccinated [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=745.54s)]
*  But it doesn't make any sense to give this to kids [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=752.98s)]
*  Then why wasn't the entire scientific community saying that because what were they saying the entire scientific community in lockstep was [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=755.46s)]
*  demonizing anybody who said that [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=762.94s)]
*  So I didn't catch this the first time the lady's pretty slick with her words [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=766.9s)]
*  So some of the things that just catch me is at the time I was saying hey, this isn't really a vaccine [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=771.7s)]
*  They're just using the word vaccine as marketing purposes and she still calls it a vaccine [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=776.46s)]
*  But she augments it now to an mRNA vaccine to let you know that's not a traditional vaccine [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=780.82s)]
*  Yes, so that's the first one [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=785.98s)]
*  Then the second one is and she's already come out and said this since but never studied for infection not supposed to work for infections [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=787.82s)]
*  Like you said then that's not new information [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=793.9000000000001s)]
*  I didn't even catch this the first time watching it [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=796.94s)]
*  But she's being slick by saying we should have given it to the elderly first [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=799.1400000000001s)]
*  So she's not really walking back that we gave it to the young [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=802.0600000000001s)]
*  But she's being a little bit slick in the way that she's describing it of that the young didn't really need it [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=804.82s)]
*  The reason I you know, this is old news. We've covered this a lot of times [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=810.0600000000001s)]
*  It's just how flagrant it is coming from her and as you're hearing the entire system yell about [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=814.1s)]
*  both that we can end the Ukraine War because it makes America look weak and that's a mistake and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=819.9000000000001s)]
*  We're just giving into Putin blah blah blah or that Doge is not actually unraveling any fraud in government whatsoever [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  and that there's a danger of [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=832.02s)]
*  Elon Musk having sensitive information that this is actually the you know [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=834.18s)]
*  They're trying to ruin our government and take away your entitlement programs [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=838.46s)]
*  It's good to see the extent by which the entire apparatus will lie to you and not to rely on the machine [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=841.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, by the way on your topic also because I don't know add one to you your point there [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=847.46s)]
*  Which is very it is very true [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=853.64s)]
*  But this has slick this this chick is is that she doesn't just wait. Okay, so when she says oh [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=856.1s)]
*  Well, we should have given it to the elderly first and not the young she was responding to Pierce [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=862.6600000000001s)]
*  Directly asking her if she shares the concerns of other doctors that there could be long-term [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=868.1s)]
*  Negative health outcomes for people who took the thing and so she pivots to well, you know [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=873.74s)]
*  It's this this limited hangout shit like okay. Well, let me give you a little bit [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  Let me give you like a few crumbs here to avoid giving you the really big piece of meat [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=883.82s)]
*  Which is that yeah, actually we record we insisted on something that has no positives and has very real negatives [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=888.78s)]
*  For an entire group of people but then essential just pivot to like oh well [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=896.62s)]
*  We should have started with the old, you know, cuz it never really did anything for transmission. I'm just saying that's not yeah [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=900.8199999999999s)]
*  No kidding. We're all past that conversation. As you said Rob [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=906.18s)]
*  We've had it a million times on this show. Some of us aren't starting five years late on it [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=910.3399999999999s)]
*  So we've had this conversation quite a bit we're way past that and [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=915.62s)]
*  You know like there does I understand by the way that this is somewhat arbitrary [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=920.82s)]
*  But there has to be kind of like some cutoff point of power of how much power you had and what you did with it [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=926.82s)]
*  We're like under a certain level. All right, we're not gonna imprison half the country for freaking out about [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=934.42s)]
*  COVID but like I'm sorry [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=941.1600000000001s)]
*  This is like how I felt look if there's just like some some liberal person who was really bad on COVID but came around [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=943.76s)]
*  And now sees that me and you were right about it like okay, you know, welcome to the team I guess [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=950.72s)]
*  But that's like Chris Cuomo [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=957.5600000000001s)]
*  Now sorry, dude, like I'm sorry [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=959.96s)]
*  I remember who you are you were the number one show on CNN given your brother puff piece interviews [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=962.9200000000001s)]
*  Faking your reemergence from your basement. I'm sorry. You can't like that's too far gone [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=968.28s)]
*  Like no Joseph Goebbels can't come over after the Nazis fall and be like, yeah. No, I've seen the light [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=973.84s)]
*  Sorry, you're too good. Now an average German citizen. Okay, we're you know, what are we gonna do? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=980.2s)]
*  We can't punish everybody but I gotta say and I had a long post on X about this the other day [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=986.24s)]
*  but [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=992.32s)]
*  Particularly now in this moment because if we don't get it in this moment [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=993.8s)]
*  I don't think we're ever gonna get it [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=997.4599999999999s)]
*  But there there needs to be some prosecution for some of the crimes that were committed and I particularly say this with [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=998.74s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy as the secretary of HHS and with Tulsi Gabbard now is the director of National Intelligence [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1005.52s)]
*  I mean if you just think about the crimes that have been committed like even just I mean [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1011.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know exactly but being in the position she was in like I don't know the legal statute [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1016.66s)]
*  Being in the position that she was in and not saying anything about this that is criminal [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1021.14s)]
*  It's just like like it's like and a horrific crime against humanity at that [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1026.26s)]
*  We think about the crimes committed just broadly speaking right in the health world and in the intelligence world [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1032.34s)]
*  like in the health world you have I [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1039.34s)]
*  Mean they freaking made the virus [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1042.24s)]
*  They funded the lab that created the virus now exactly how you know [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1045.7s)]
*  How far does that rabbit hole go go? I don't know you know like is it was it really for bioweapons purposes? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1051.5s)]
*  Was it intentionally released out of the lab? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1059.18s)]
*  I mean these are just questions that we don't really have an answer to but I'll work on the assumption that it's neither of those things [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1062.22s)]
*  Okay work on the assumption that they were just they were funding gain-of-function research because they thought it could help them cure more [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1068.02s)]
*  Viruses down the road or something like that right whatever the legitimate purpose of gain-of-function research would be [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1075.06s)]
*  Okay, so you funded this thing created it had such substandard [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1081.74s)]
*  Like conditions that the thing gets out you then all lie through your teeth as you're locking down [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1087.68s)]
*  The world in response to the thing that you made without ever admitting that you made it [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1094.22s)]
*  Okay, and then after all of that you come up with this vaccine and lie through your fucking teeth to get people to inject [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1099.8799999999999s)]
*  Something into their body that they can't uninject [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1108.44s)]
*  Knowing damn well that it doesn't work the way you're selling it as knowingly lying about that and getting people to take this thing [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1111.24s)]
*  After you've gotten the government to shield these pharmaceutical companies from liability so that they can rake in tens of billions of dollars in [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1117.64s)]
*  profits [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1124.92s)]
*  I'm sorry someone needs to be prosecuted for that [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1126.0s)]
*  Like there is a level where you're like no we can't just move on from this [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1128.68s)]
*  You can't just come on Pierce Morgan's show and get to go. Yeah, we did it all wrong like what and then on the intelligence side [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1132.86s)]
*  I mean look what can I even say about this? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1140.6s)]
*  We the country and everyone knows this is true, right? The country has been lied into wars [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1144.24s)]
*  They have instituted torture they've lied to the president of the United States [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1150.1999999999998s)]
*  They've tried to frame the president of the United States for treason when they didn't like what he might potentially do and they've blatantly [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1157.06s)]
*  interfered in US presidential elections [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1164.76s)]
*  Someone's got to go to jail for that. I [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1167.76s)]
*  Don't think this is too unreasonable to go. Okay, so like what's this new Trump administration really made of we got these guys [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1170.8s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy Tulsi Gabbard people who have are on record calling out these crimes [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1178.08s)]
*  For many years who are now in charge of the Health Department and the intelligence agencies [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1184.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't think it's too much to ask for that [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1190.4399999999998s)]
*  Like I want these crimes to be exposed and when these crimes are exposed the people these are like the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1192.8s)]
*  amongst the gravest crimes ever committed by the US government against the American people and the same government that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1199.24s)]
*  I'm talking about here will throw you in a cage for [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1207.6799999999998s)]
*  Decades if you were to bring a gun across state lines when you're not allowed to have it in the other state [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1213.6399999999999s)]
*  They'll throw people in cages for decades over having the wrong plant or distributing the wrong plant [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1219.76s)]
*  They'll throw people in jail for all types of minor infractions that this is why we have the biggest prison population in the world [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1225.6s)]
*  Both in terms of raw numbers and percentage of population [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1233.0s)]
*  Because our government will throw people indicate you break the law you get thrown in jail like, okay [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1236.56s)]
*  Well, if we're gonna do that, why exactly should these people who have committed the most the gravest crimes against humanity? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1242.1599999999999s)]
*  Why should they not be prosecuted for this? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1249.08s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show and there's that draconian rule [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1321.28s)]
*  I'm not gonna get this phrase right but there's some line like ignorance of the law isn't an excuse for violating it [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  Which is why I loves to tell you that which is wild that there can be laws that you're not even aware of and now you're [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1330.4399999999998s)]
*  Responsible for it. So in this case [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1336.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean if the law doesn't allow you to plead negligence and not only you're way past that because you were you were claiming [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1338.34s)]
*  Elite knowledge authority. I don't know. There's probably a better way to put that but you were saying I'm the most knowledgeable [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1346.46s)]
*  So everyone needs to listen to me [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1352.1399999999999s)]
*  So for one you shouldn't then be able to claim negligence later because you actually exerted elite knowledge authority [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1354.22s)]
*  And then you were actually just lying [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1360.6399999999999s)]
*  So, yeah [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1362.64s)]
*  there's absolutely no excuse for being this lady and feeling comfortable just coming out on television and now flipping the script and [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1363.3200000000002s)]
*  Like you said Gerbils just joining, you know the allies and going who why would anyone say that about Jews? That's terrible [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1370.2s)]
*  You can't say such things [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1376.24s)]
*  We were totally wrong to do that by the way, like that was crazy and we really shouldn't have done it that way [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1377.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's um, there's just not [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1382.64s)]
*  Turns out it was short-sighted and it might have actually harmed [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1386.24s)]
*  As more of the country doesn't trust them and and now the outsider that was criticized them has gotten the government post [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1389.88s)]
*  Maybe the short-sightedness of two years of great profits wasn't worth [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1396.16s)]
*  Ruining our entire industry by forcing everyone to get one of our things that wasn't that good [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1400.68s)]
*  that's right and and looked like the [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1406.16s)]
*  It's just so funny because it's always [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1408.76s)]
*  In some weird weird way. This is always and I remember people [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1411.8000000000002s)]
*  Like a Buck Sexton was one of the guys who I remember making this point he was great [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1416.8s)]
*  He's like a former CIA guy [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1422.2s)]
*  but he was great on Russia gate the whole time like the whole time he was like this is complete bullshit and they're [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1423.76s)]
*  Donald Trump's getting framed by the FBI and the CIA and [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1430.24s)]
*  Then I remember hearing him at one point where he goes [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1434.72s)]
*  You know [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1437.4s)]
*  the worst part of Russia gate is that now trust in the FBI and the CIA has been totally eroded for at least a [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1437.64s)]
*  Generation and I was like no, that's the best part of it. That's the only good thing that came out of this and likewise [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1445.2399999999998s)]
*  It's just so bizarre to see who's like [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1452.04s)]
*  Oh and now vaccine hesitancy has doubled and I think the takeaway of that is supposed to be that it's like oh [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1453.7199999999998s)]
*  And that's bad because vaccines save lives, but I'm just looking at it like no, I think it's good [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1460.6s)]
*  Yeah, when we found out you would lie through your teeth to us. We don't trust you anymore [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1466.4399999999998s)]
*  Correct that is a that is a natural and healthy response to someone lying to you over and over again [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1472.88s)]
*  That's the correct response is to not trust that person anymore [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1480.8s)]
*  That is not like it is an un if you and this is true just in your personal life [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1484.88s)]
*  If there is somebody who lies to you over and over again and you still give them trust that is you're fucking up [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1489.44s)]
*  That is not the correct response [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1497.52s)]
*  And the correct response is to not trust them anymore. So yes the American people we don't believe you [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1500.16s)]
*  We don't believe you about any of it [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1506.48s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that we're gonna you know, we want to jump to sloppy conclusions [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1508.48s)]
*  But it does mean that like all of you guys need to go you all need to go out of the way [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1512.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, like there's um [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1519.08s)]
*  Well, I can't remember exactly the example, but I think there's just been so many examples like this [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1521.6399999999999s)]
*  But you would think that like if you if you wanted to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1529.04s)]
*  maintain [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1533.88s)]
*  Trust in the system this kind of vague abstract thing that a lot of people claim is really really important [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1535.04s)]
*  I don't agree with them. But regardless, maybe it let's say they're right. Okay, well then [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1542.44s)]
*  when the Mueller report came out and [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1547.6000000000001s)]
*  indicated that there was no evidence of [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1552.4s)]
*  Conspiracy between Donald Trump and the Russians after this after this multi-year long tens of millions of dollars spent on this investigation [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1555.56s)]
*  If we had seen the next day mass [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1563.3999999999999s)]
*  resignations at the FBI and in the corporate media [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1567.9199999999998s)]
*  That would have done a lot to maintain trust in the system to go like look you guys got it spectacularly wrong [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1573.0s)]
*  But when they did [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1579.72s)]
*  So many of these journalists, you know Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O'Donnell and joy read they all went [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1581.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, we can't be newsmen anymore, you know, obviously like we got we went all in on this big story and it was completely wrong [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1587.8400000000001s)]
*  So we got I got to go find some other career, you know, cuz I can't be trusted with this information anymore [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1594.3400000000001s)]
*  I can't be trusted as like an arbiter of truth anymore [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1600.3600000000001s)]
*  quarterback with an entire season of fumbles [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1604.4s)]
*  Yeah, and then you're like, okay, so I guess you're not gonna start next year, right? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1607.24s)]
*  So like what I don't know. This is just if you actually wanted to maintain trust in any of these institutions [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1611.1999999999998s)]
*  Then you should be the one demanding at the very least. I mean, I'm talking about prosecution [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1617.6s)]
*  But at the very least mass resignations mass firings something like that. It's just it's unbelievable [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1622.1999999999998s)]
*  It's unbelievable that these people are even able [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1629.1999999999998s)]
*  To it's also it's unbelievable that they're able to like she could say what she says on Piers Morgan and not be like, oh [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1633.28s)]
*  I'm I can't even say this out loud because I'm admitting what? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1640.16s)]
*  Criminal and when I say criminal in this sense with her, I don't even know maybe there's not a legal statute death [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1645.84s)]
*  but I just mean criminal in the in the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1650.5s)]
*  in the higher sense of [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1653.24s)]
*  The the word you know what I mean [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1655.68s)]
*  I'm sure it's not legal about this. I'm sure it's not criminal because it's got the old Fauci [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1658.0800000000002s)]
*  I was just making recommendations [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1663.44s)]
*  Sure, I was the head authority and I took the authority and I got on television [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1666.0s)]
*  I but me I never said the things I was saying that was the CDC. I was that guy. I was that guy [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1670.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, I'm sure she's got the same [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1677.2s)]
*  plausible deniability of [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1679.8s)]
*  Just making recommendations [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1681.8s)]
*  No, I I agree with you what I mean is more like if you were like if you and a group of people were like [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1683.16s)]
*  On a desert island that had never been inhabited by people before so there is no government. There is no law [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1689.3200000000002s)]
*  There's nothing and you you murder somebody like there may not be courts or laws or anything [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1694.7s)]
*  But on a moral level you did something just as evil as if you murdered someone in [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1701.72s)]
*  Connecticut or New York City or you know what I mean? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1706.88s)]
*  And so I'm just saying like on it like on a moral level like that is a crime [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1709.48s)]
*  This is fucking criminal what you did to people so ruin people's lives and then by the way, you know [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1713.6000000000001s)]
*  It's great that you know, of course, I think she's not as attached to the vaccine [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1719.96s)]
*  Regime as she was to the lockdown regime. So now she'll come out and blast them, but let's do the lockdowns next [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1725.0s)]
*  Let's go through that again. You know what I mean? Like let's go through what you actually were a part of was that a good idea? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1730.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean if we only should have vaccinated the people highly at risk, maybe we only should have quarantined the people highly at risk [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1736.08s)]
*  Maybe you quarantining children wasn't a good idea. Just like vaccinating them wasn't a good idea [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1743.08s)]
*  God and and then on top of all of it. It's also that like I'm like this has [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1749.92s)]
*  dramatically [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1755.96s)]
*  Changed but also like even do you I mean if you remember [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1757.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you do well because we played it on the show and it was a pretty you know, like monumental cultural moment [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1763.6s)]
*  but when John Stewart went on [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1768.8s)]
*  The Colbert report and had that whole thing about how obviously it came from the lab and it's just it's such an easy idea to [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1771.08s)]
*  Mock that it didn't come from the lab [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1777.04s)]
*  At the time I remember all of us were like we were like, oh well, okay about time [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1779.3999999999999s)]
*  They started talking about this but then we were also kind of like oh shit [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1785.6s)]
*  Like someone actually said it on a network show and which is kind of crazy and [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1789.8s)]
*  Saying what she just said right now was the type of thing as you pointed out Rob that me and you were saying all [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1795.04s)]
*  The time and it came it came with such a price tag to say that like you were at risk of [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1801.32s)]
*  Losing your channel of being like viciously smeared like there were real [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1808.0s)]
*  Costs associated with saying this and now years later, you know [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1813.56s)]
*  Again, it's just the only thing I could think of is it's like Cuomo that's like Cuomo [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1816.8s)]
*  well, and and I'm sitting there watching the whole thing and it's like [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1820.8s)]
*  dude, so Joe Rogan was two years ago under the biggest cancellation attempt in [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1824.96s)]
*  cancel culture history [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1833.68s)]
*  Forcing exactly what you're saying right now and then you you just get to say it with this casual air of like [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1835.72s)]
*  I'm just throwing something out there with complete comfortability [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1843.28s)]
*  Knowing that nothing bad will happen to you for saying it [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1846.6s)]
*  This is just you know, if you really do care about like unifying the country or moving forward or regaining trust [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1850.2s)]
*  I'll tell you I think there's only really one way to do it [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1856.6s)]
*  And that's that some of these people at the top have to be prosecuted [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1858.96s)]
*  That is that is the answer [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1863.08s)]
*  All right [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1866.2s)]
*  speaking of [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1867.84s)]
*  the [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1869.44s)]
*  Corporate media dealing with or people from the old regime kind of dealing with the the latest developments [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1870.88s)]
*  this was a [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1878.7600000000002s)]
*  Amazing little moment every now and then you get these amazing moments [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1881.3200000000002s)]
*  where [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1886.2800000000002s)]
*  establishment type people kind of let the truth slip out and [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1888.16s)]
*  on a on Amazon BC they had a [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1892.64s)]
*  Marraga [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1897.4s)]
*  Marraga she's a writer for the New York Times [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1899.28s)]
*  And she this is the Tom Elliott tweet Natalie Tom Elliott great follow on Twitter [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1902.6s)]
*  If you don't follow him make sure to do so [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1908.68s)]
*  But I thought this was a great moment that just you know [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1910.9199999999998s)]
*  If you want to understand why we are where we are as a country this one really kind of gives it away here is [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1913.6s)]
*  Miss gray [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1921.32s)]
*  Talking about the role of journalists [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1923.04s)]
*  There is a pretty good legal case that Elon Musk should not even have access to be carrying out this [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1925.88s)]
*  Purge that he is [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1934.0400000000002s)]
*  And and secondly I would say that we have zero transparency really into how this is being done [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1936.0800000000002s)]
*  Really, I think the message that the American people need to be hearing more is that all of this is being done [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1944.72s)]
*  Slashing and burning to [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1951.8799999999999s)]
*  essentially prepare the country for Donald Trump's tax cuts to the wealthy and there's got to be a way to pay for that and [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1954.12s)]
*  What's going to happen is that everyday Americans in their everyday lives are paying for it already? We're seeing it in [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1961.8s)]
*  You know government services that are going to suffer already. We've been seeing that the FAA is [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1969.4399999999998s)]
*  Really not up to the mark at the moment. They're being gutted [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1975.72s)]
*  Medicaid Medicare [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1979.7199999999998s)]
*  Every part of the government that touches Americans lives is about to be impacted and it's not clear yet that [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1981.76s)]
*  There's a broad realization of this outside of Washington DC [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1988.84s)]
*  but it it's coming and I think that's one of the questions that I have just as a journalist right now is [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1992.84s)]
*  Do everyday Americans in the rest of the country understand that this is going to impact their lives in ways? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=1999.4799999999998s)]
*  They can't even imagine yet. That's part of our job is to explain that this is not just about [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2005.36s)]
*  Government workers in Washington. This is about the IRS. This is about people's tax returns. This is about people's Social Security [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2010.76s)]
*  Nothing is secure right now and the government is not being remade to be efficient [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2018.1599999999999s)]
*  this is an effort to destroy it and [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2024.56s)]
*  I think that is [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2027.56s)]
*  the core message that Democrats [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2030.24s)]
*  Need to be explaining [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2033.08s)]
*  Every day in great detail. This is not an effort to make things more efficient every American understands [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2035.12s)]
*  There's ways to make government more efficient. Nobody is against that, but this is not an effort to do that [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2040.6799999999998s)]
*  This is an effort to destroy the government so that it's easier for oligarchs and the Heritage Foundation to do whatever they wish. Oh [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2046.7199999999998s)]
*  Yes, let me tell you something. I [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2054.36s)]
*  Wish you were right [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2057.44s)]
*  God do I what can you imagine Rob? This isn't just an effort to make the government more efficient [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2059.36s)]
*  Everybody supports that we all support that this is an effort to destroy the government [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2064.32s)]
*  Ah, I wish I wish but isn't it? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2069.8s)]
*  First of all, there's just so much here the freak out about Doge is just like it's it's got to be up there as one of [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2073.2400000000002s)]
*  the most revealing [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2080.0s)]
*  Freakouts like it this has always been in some weird I think [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2081.6800000000003s)]
*  Unintended kind of [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2087.08s)]
*  Inspector gadgety type of way. It's always been one of Donald Trump's superpowers [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2089.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that he just like he gets the media class so furious that they reveal themselves [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2093.96s)]
*  But the Doge thing has been his masterpiece [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2100.24s)]
*  I mean the response to this for her to actually say [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2103.2999999999997s)]
*  And like you could spin this in terms of like what she meant, but she actually says it's our job [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2106.96s)]
*  It's our job [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2113.52s)]
*  To make people realize that cuts in government and tax cuts are really bad and [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2115.56s)]
*  That big government is really good [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2122.64s)]
*  Essentially, that's what she's saying. It's her job [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2125.68s)]
*  It's our job to explain to the American people Rob because you see the thing is Doge is kind of popular with the American people [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2127.44s)]
*  They kind of like this idea of draining the swamp and and getting yeah [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2133.8s)]
*  Because who doesn't like the idea of getting rid of fraud and abuse, you know what I mean? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2138.54s)]
*  But so people kind of like that so it's our job to explain to them that no, no, no, no [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2142.16s)]
*  This is actually really terrible. It's really bad because if you cut down on the size of government you might get [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2146.04s)]
*  oligarchy [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2154.3599999999997s)]
*  That's because that's what the oligarchs want [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2155.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that right? Isn't that always what every powerful person who really runs the government what which is by the way? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2158.3999999999996s)]
*  What an oligarch is but all those people they really want the government to have no power at all [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2164.92s)]
*  That's always what they've wanted. It's just fascinating to me. I don't know any thoughts rub [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2170.52s)]
*  the things that really jumped out at me was first her complaint about the [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2176.08s)]
*  Transparency of how Elon Musk is doing the slashing [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2180.24s)]
*  She doesn't seem to be concerned with the transparency of how the money is being spent if anything [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2184.64s)]
*  He's bringing transparency to fraud and abuse [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2189.56s)]
*  But you don't seem to be concerned with government just having four trillion dollars going to unknown places that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2192.12s)]
*  I'm sorry, right. I mean, it's such a good point, dude [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2199.18s)]
*  It's just such a good point [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2201.9s)]
*  It's and I just think it can't I'm sorry keep in mind that where you were going with that [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2203.2599999999998s)]
*  But it just can't be stressed how good a point that is is that might be the best point that has been made on this [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2207.34s)]
*  Show in several episodes think about the idea of anybody's complaint with doge being a lack of [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2212.3s)]
*  Transparency by the way, I'm all for doge being as transparent as possible [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2219.98s)]
*  I'd like to know every goddamn thing they find every program they plan on recommending to cut I'm all for transparency [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2223.82s)]
*  But if you have an issue with a lack of transparency [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2229.94s)]
*  Okay, where have you been in the last? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2233.78s)]
*  1020 however many years you've been doing this where have you been on the CIA on the Federal Reserve on the FBI on? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2237.6200000000003s)]
*  Just all of these government programs. Where have you been on that? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2245.82s)]
*  This don't give me this bullshit about how you care about transparency half of our government the part with teeth [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2248.8999999999996s)]
*  Operates in the shadows in complete secrecy the fuck out of here. Your issue is transparency [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2255.62s)]
*  I'm sorry keep going but you're so spot-on about that. So and we're also we're still at the start of this one [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2262.14s)]
*  So I don't want to I don't want to jump too far ahead and endorse too much of doge because we'll see how it plays out [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2269.0s)]
*  And if you continue to spot fraud great and if this seems to be some sort of a data collection scheme by Elon Musk then bad [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2274.4s)]
*  But we'll see it feels to me like at the moment [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2281.04s)]
*  I'm watching the makings of another Russia collusion story where they're very specifically saying that they're not looking for people's entitlement programs [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2284.4s)]
*  They're looking for fraud and abuse they're coming out with stories of finding fraud and abuse and then you get these people on the news [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2291.94s)]
*  That are going no, they have no interest in fraud and abuse. They're really gonna get rid of your entitlement programs [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2297.8s)]
*  And like you were pointing out they're literally telling you hey and we're engaged in propaganda because it's our job not to report the information [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2302.6s)]
*  But to re-educate the American public that there's risk here that they can't even fathom nor am I able to articulate [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2309.24s)]
*  But just everyone trust us that what's happening here is not what they're telling you and we need to put an end to it [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2315.96s)]
*  Even if it looks helpful [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2321.16s)]
*  It's amazing to me and I hope same as Deborah Brooks [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2323.04s)]
*  This lady should be held responsible because if you're working at the New York Times and it turns out that they're actually just cleaning up fraud [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2326.68s)]
*  And abuse and you're telling people we need to put an end to it because they're coming for your entitlement programs [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2332.44s)]
*  That's a pretty bold lie [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2336.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, 100% and look I mean this this says so much about how we got to where we are now [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2338.96s)]
*  you know like the the idea that you're sitting look if what [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2346.2s)]
*  Journalism is and there are still by the way some people who do it [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2352.7400000000002s)]
*  None of them on MSNBC, but there are still some people who do journalism [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2356.86s)]
*  But journalism would be like if you were to say our job is this our job is to inform you of what Doge is doing [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2361.38s)]
*  Inform you about what they've uncovered and you know present their argument for why this is fraud and should be cut and then present [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2370.5s)]
*  The other argument for why it's dangerous to cut this stuff or you could say hey look there are people who argue that it's illegal [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2377.8s)]
*  For Doge to have this information other people argue it is legal [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2384.0800000000004s)]
*  That's journalism to give you the information so that you can then decide [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2387.32s)]
*  What you think whose side you're on or who you or on what aspects are on this side or that side? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2392.0400000000004s)]
*  To say that our job is to make you [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2398.1600000000003s)]
*  Come to a conclusion about that our job is to make it so that you understand [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2402.36s)]
*  that cutting the government is bad and growing the government is good and cutting taxes is bad and [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2408.28s)]
*  Increasing taxes is good and also I'm gonna do it with like just ridiculous [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2414.2000000000003s)]
*  Hyperbole that nobody could really argue is the case and then make you emotional [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2419.04s)]
*  You know say they're they're destroying government the goal is an efficiency. It's the destruction of the government. Sorry [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2423.08s)]
*  That's not journalism. That's propaganda and and evil propaganda at that because of course [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2430.2599999999998s)]
*  Tax cuts are great and I shrinking the size of government is great. It's it's inherently in the [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2438.06s)]
*  Individuals interest it's in the American people's interest obviously. This is so obvious [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2444.4599999999996s)]
*  It's it's just a priority true that it's all things being equal [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2449.66s)]
*  It's in your interest to pay less in taxes, right? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2453.4599999999996s)]
*  That's the money from taxes comes out of your paycheck [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2456.8999999999996s)]
*  So obviously the starting point isn't neutral [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2460.06s)]
*  The starting point would be as everybody knows like if you if you have no other [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2462.7s)]
*  Information and the only piece of information you get is hey your taxes are going down [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2467.3799999999997s)]
*  Most workers reaction to that is great because that's the starting point is that's a good thing [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2472.22s)]
*  So anyway, I'm sorry. Go ahead [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2478.4599999999996s)]
*  I also I just can't stand boogie man logic of it was what was going on with the during the election project [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2480.3399999999997s)]
*  2025 and if it's enacted well, then what what exactly is the risk or insert in this case with the IRS audit? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2486.5400000000004s)]
*  It happens to be for what I understand [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2492.5400000000004s)]
*  There's one person on the doge team that has security clearance that will then be able to I guess [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2494.1400000000003s)]
*  Review the IRS and do some sort of right it and all the complaints are about well [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2498.1400000000003s)]
*  The big data the big data the big data has already been collected. It's already in government hands [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2502.5s)]
*  So now it's another person with government security clearance that's going to review it [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2507.42s)]
*  I think in my interest to see what the IRS is up to can you explain to me what the risk is here? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2511.66s)]
*  I'm open to the storyline, but when it's just boogie man logic of it was a complaint about data collection [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2516.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, then why aren't we complaining about government data collection? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2522.66s)]
*  And why aren't you writing newspaper articles about the relationship? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2525.66s)]
*  BD 18 18 t and all these other companies that sell big data to the government or what about all the data that they harvest? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2528.5s)]
*  Offshore remember what happened with Tucker Carlson when it became clear that they were wiretapping him [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2535.46s)]
*  So if the complaints about big debt government data collection, what where all those news stories? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2540.5s)]
*  Why is it suddenly when there's one person assigned by the government with security clearance? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2546.2200000000003s)]
*  That's going to review what they're doing that the data collections a problem. I just can't see the boogie claims [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2551.0600000000004s)]
*  No, it's funny. And by the way, this is perhaps to some degree showing our age because we do use these terms sometimes [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2556.5800000000004s)]
*  Even though they're it's even like I'll say [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2563.46s)]
*  like I I've referred for many years to [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2565.78s)]
*  DVR when you record something as taping it. It's like, oh, let's make sure we tape that [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2569.78s)]
*  You know what? I would give it's just like this relic of the 90s. You know what? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2575.38s)]
*  I mean like tape what does tape have to do with it? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2578.78s)]
*  People still call these shows podcasts and no one's had an iPod in many years [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2581.18s)]
*  But even as you said like wiretapping Tucker you're just to be clear. You're just doing the same thing [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2584.78s)]
*  You're using one of these all it's actually so much creepier than that because there's no wire involved. You know what? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2590.86s)]
*  It's not even like in the olden days it'd be like oh they like plugged into your phone [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2595.86s)]
*  It's no they just take all of your luck. You take everything you have from your goddamn phone [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2601.5800000000004s)]
*  They just take all your fucking metadata. And yes, they 100% did that to Tucker [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2606.2200000000003s)]
*  But look with all these things just like I said like oh like you care about [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2610.0600000000004s)]
*  You care about transparency, but you don't care that like well look Elon Musk and here's sorry [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2615.7400000000002s)]
*  I just got a lot of thoughts in my head [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2622.94s)]
*  Let me try to get them out one at a time [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2624.06s)]
*  But so even to your point I completely agree with you and you go look we will see where this doge thing goes [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2625.66s)]
*  Like this is not exactly what would have been me or your first choice [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2631.14s)]
*  Like our first choice probably would have just been drastic cuts in government spending like let Congress abolish all the departments that they created [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2635.78s)]
*  Abolish the EPA abolish the Department of Education [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2644.3s)]
*  Abolish the NSA abolish the ATF like all this shit can just go [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2647.5s)]
*  It's all just garbage and all pure corruption. That's the fraud waste and abuse the whole thing [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2652.06s)]
*  Okay, we didn't get that and so we're getting this other thing and we're like, alright [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2658.46s)]
*  Well, let's see what they can do and I'm with you. Let's see [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2662.2599999999998s)]
*  Let's let's see how all of this goes [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2665.66s)]
*  But at the very least you go they have in a way that you can you know, they have inserted into the national [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2667.46s)]
*  Conversation this issue of how government wastes your money like nobody else [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2674.58s)]
*  No one else in my life has ever made this as big of a [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2680.6200000000003s)]
*  Cultural phenomenon where everybody's focused and keenly aware of this and there were people who tried the great Ron Paul [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2684.82s)]
*  I think there were people in the tea party movement who were trying to do this [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2691.6600000000003s)]
*  But none of them ever succeeded to this level of public consciousness [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2695.7000000000003s)]
*  So, okay, we'll see but let me listen if you you're telling me you you care about [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2701.26s)]

*  This is how their brand of journalism works that when you talk about the government you're talking about [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2939.2s)]
*  Competence and wonderful people who just do everything right [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2946.44s)]
*  Like who who on the left or the right actually thinks that this represents anything remotely? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2950.5600000000004s)]
*  resembling our current government [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2957.96s)]
*  Or forget the current government. It was it was fine under Joe Biden [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2960.4s)]
*  Joe Biden just a [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2965.04s)]
*  Legendary example of competence Rob. Isn't that what you would what you would say, you know here [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2968.1200000000003s)]
*  Let's go to the next clip too because it's just it's like give you a flavor of how everybody's reacting. Let's go to the [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2974.32s)]
*  It's it's another Tom Elliott tweet the the second to last one with an Apple bomb. Yeah, there we go [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2982.2s)]
*  No, nor was it 50,000 in condoms but anyway, but no they there have been that [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2991.32s)]
*  You know clearly false statements about payments to politico about payments to Chelsea Clinton [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=2996.6s)]
*  About about condoms from Gaza [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3002.48s)]
*  there has also been a [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3005.4s)]
*  Kind of smear campaign conducted against USAID which has been the United States's premier [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3007.6800000000003s)]
*  Institution both for distributing humanitarian aid around the world helping the poorest people on the planet [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3014.64s)]
*  has also been really important to [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3019.8s)]
*  the promotion of democracy [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3022.48s)]
*  the in you know in [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3025.04s)]
*  In parts of the world that the US has cared about it's been a really important tool of American foreign policy and [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3027.84s)]
*  Musk has sometimes leaked things and sometimes revealed things that were well known [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3034.0s)]
*  I mean most of the information about USAID spending has been available on government websites forever [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3038.44s)]
*  You know if you wanted to know something about it, you could have you could have found out last year [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3044.56s)]
*  but the the goal of doing this seems to have been to [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3049.52s)]
*  Traumatize the people who work for USAID and also to traumatize people who work for other government institutions [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3053.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean everybody saw what happened right at USAID [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3059.78s)]
*  Was from one day to the next destroyed. This is a congressionally [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3062.82s)]
*  created institution and Congress had no voice in destroying it and [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3067.6200000000003s)]
*  Its members were smeared and its goals were distorted [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3071.6200000000003s)]
*  And now everybody who works for any other part of the federal government knows that the same thing could happen to them [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3075.9s)]
*  So the purpose of doing that right at the beginning particularly something like foreign aid [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3081.9s)]
*  Which is maybe less well understood than it should be [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3086.42s)]
*  Among most Americans the purpose of doing that was to frighten other people and to make other people in other parts of the government [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3088.98s)]
*  aware that at any moment they could be the targets of that kind of campaign to [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3096.6600000000003s)]
*  And Applebaum. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. You have this whole article in the Atlantic. Appreciate your time [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3101.42s)]
*  Yeah, well Rob I [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3107.86s)]
*  Maybe we got to walk back some of the stuff we've been saying here. I never really [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3110.26s)]
*  Took the time to appreciate how traumatized [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3114.82s)]
*  people federal government employees must be [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3118.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, hold on. Let me take a second to think about that. Oh, yeah, I don't care [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3121.54s)]
*  That's great [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3126.6200000000003s)]
*  If this is traumatizing to if you if it if you are traumatized by the fact that you may not be able to be [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3127.98s)]
*  a [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3136.7000000000003s)]
*  Parasite on the American taxpayer anymore. I am a okay with that [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3138.22s)]
*  They okay, not a problem at all. Now. This is another angle Rob that [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3143.46s)]
*  There's it's really funny because I mean so much of this stuff is just like it's so basic [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3148.8999999999996s)]
*  But one of the other angles which I'm sure you've heard that they're saying is just that it's like oh, these are these are jobs [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3153.98s)]
*  You're cutting American jobs [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3161.22s)]
*  Or these people are like, oh now there's gonna be all these people out of work [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3163.5s)]
*  This will devastate communities if they all get fired from their jobs as if you're supposed to think that [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3167.18s)]
*  government employees [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3174.3399999999997s)]
*  Being fired is somehow a negative for the economy [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3176.14s)]
*  It's just too ridiculous [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3180.8199999999997s)]
*  Like it's it's literally on the level look if you are being paid with taxpayer dollars [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3182.8999999999996s)]
*  Then you are in a parasitic relationship with the taxpayer you are taking from them you being fired [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3189.66s)]
*  Means less has to be taken from them. That is not a negative. It is a positive likewise [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3197.98s)]
*  Or like what so in other words if if you're like if you take a household, let's say [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3204.34s)]
*  Okay, and let's say I work and my wife doesn't work and my kids don't work [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3210.18s)]
*  So I'm the only one who's working in the house and I'm bringing in money and you go [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3216.58s)]
*  You know, we're really tight for money like we don't our bills are too high [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3220.46s)]
*  What I'm making is too little now if my wife were to go outside the house and get a job [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3223.7s)]
*  Okay. Now we have two jobs. Okay, so we have more money coming in but a taxpayer a government job would be more like [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3229.06s)]
*  Okay [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3237.46s)]
*  So I'm the only one who works and I'm not bringing in enough money. Okay. So what I'm doing is I'm gonna hire my wife [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3238.58s)]
*  She's gonna work for me and I'm also gonna hire both of my kids. So they're gonna work for me [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3245.7799999999997s)]
*  So now Rob instead of one job, we have four jobs in this house. Isn't that that much better? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3250.94s)]
*  This is great, right? I just went from one job to four jobs. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that like oh no [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3259.86s)]
*  That's not better at all. In fact, it's worse because you have to pay them [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3265.58s)]
*  You just added three more expenses coming out of your paycheck. You didn't make your paycheck any bigger [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3269.62s)]
*  So no, it doesn't actually help to have more government jobs [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3275.7s)]
*  It's all just nonsense and it's funny how that like one of the common themes through all of this shit and it's it's it's funny [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3279.58s)]
*  Now that it's uh, it's just really starting like this is a big one [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3287.62s)]
*  That's starting to come out and I really credit Bobby [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3290.9s)]
*  Kennedy is the one who deserves the credit for for mainstreaming this although it is something that maybe was not our [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3293.62s)]
*  Our major focus during kovat, but it was definitely something we talked about a lot during kovat [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3300.18s)]
*  But that you know again and the numbers aren't as fresh in my head [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3305.2999999999997s)]
*  But it was something like 78 percent of the people hospitalized with kovat were obese [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3308.3799999999997s)]
*  and then there's a huge correlation between obesity or diabetes and and [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3313.3399999999997s)]
*  Kovat complications and then there was there was a bunch of others too where it's just like now they're all admitting it [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3319.7799999999997s)]
*  That's like oh, you know the reason [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3324.98s)]
*  Why America lost more people to kovat than most other countries did was not because we didn't socially distance [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3327.22s)]
*  While we were outside and it wasn't because we didn't mask up [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3334.22s)]
*  It wasn't because teenagers went to the beach or because we you know, whatever is because we're a sick country [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3337.74s)]
*  That seems to be like really what led to it is that way [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3344.66s)]
*  So while the entire media class and the entire government class is having this this huge freak out about health [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3347.9s)]
*  They're missing the major story [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3356.98s)]
*  Which is that we're the sickest country in the world and what this this happens over and over again like wall, you know, there's um [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3359.18s)]
*  there's a freak out about say like who is a [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3367.58s)]
*  Foreign asset who's a Russian asset or who's a you know, whatever an Iranian asset or whatever it might be [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3372.66s)]
*  It's like oh, you're not looking at the real crisis, which is that we're in a permanent state of war [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3380.06s)]
*  That's the real crisis that's actually threatening our Republic and like that, you know [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3386.14s)]
*  If you listen to the corporate media, you would think that the crisis is that these guys are taking a shredder to government [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3390.9s)]
*  Right like what this this pretend reporter lady just said they're trying to destroy government [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3399.94s)]
*  That's the real crisis here. Rob, right is that government is way too small [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3405.18s)]
*  The real crisis is that government employees are scared. They're not gonna get their new their new paycheck [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3409.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, here is what the real crisis is the last year for fiscal year [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3414.8199999999997s)]
*  2024 and the double check me on this number, but I'm pretty damn close to it. It was [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3421.8599999999997s)]
*  The interest on the debt was one point two trillion dollars [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3427.3399999999997s)]
*  Guys, I might be a little bit off. It was right around one point two trillion dollars [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3433.3799999999997s)]
*  That is just the interest on the national debt. Okay, and that number is going up [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3436.62s)]
*  It's going up no matter what anybody does [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3441.2999999999997s)]
*  So we have now entered the stage of a debt spiral where we are you I don't know Rob [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3443.94s)]
*  You're old enough to remember it used to be kind of a big deal when we first hit trillion dollar deficits [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3450.1s)]
*  And you're like, wait a minute. Hold on our deficits have gone from the hundreds of billions into over a trillion [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3455.38s)]
*  Like we had a year where it was over a trillion dollars [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3460.98s)]
*  We're adding over a trillion dollars to the national debt every year [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3464.02s)]
*  Well, just to make this clear right now and going forward [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3469.02s)]
*  Even if Congress balanced their budget, which is a pretty huge if we're still running a trillion dollars plus deficit [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3473.46s)]
*  Even if they balanced everything else, we're still in the hole a trill in other words to truly have a balance [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3482.46s)]
*  Budget we would now need more than a trillion dollars of surplus just to break even [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3489.1s)]
*  And while that's going on, they're freaking out about the prospects of theoretical cuts to government spending [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3496.1s)]
*  Let that sink in for a little bit. That's where we're at [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3504.1s)]
*  It's truly unbelievable [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3510.1s)]
*  I think this is going to be the new Russia collusion story with just the level of lying that's coming from the press [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3513.1s)]
*  As you know, what's most interesting about that clip is she says that the political story is not true [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3521.1s)]
*  So somebody's blatantly lying either political had a newsletter that was forty thousand dollar subscription to the press [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3528.1s)]
*  I forget the number was a four million a year [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3535.1s)]
*  I forget the number but either there was a number that the US government was paying to Politico or not [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3540.1s)]
*  So like that one should be black and white if you're a journalist [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3545.1s)]
*  Do you have the receipts for why Elon Musk was just lying on that because it was reported by a number of news outlets [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3549.1s)]
*  Or are you literally just lying because if you're just on the news lying shouldn't there be I don't know [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3555.1s)]
*  a defamation or something how do you just get up and say that's not true [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp-XehUQtK4&t=3561.1s)]
