**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY)
*  What is up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. I'm running [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=0.0s)]
*  solo for this episode, but thanks everybody for tuning in. Robbie the Fireburnstein will [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=12.84s)]
*  be back with me tomorrow on the Members Only episode. Yeah, a lot to talk about today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=18.36s)]
*  Before we get into it, I do quick just a couple of obligatory announcements. I am coming [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=27.62s)]
*  to Louisville, Kentucky on January 30th, one night only. Come out and then the next two [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=35.42s)]
*  days, January 31st and February 1st, I'll be in Fort Wayne, Indiana the following week [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=46.46s)]
*  in Key West, Florida. All of those dates with Robbie the Fireburnstein, ComicDaveSmith.com [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=52.22s)]
*  for all of the ticket links. And then of course, as I've mentioned for the past couple episodes, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=59.58s)]
*  I will be participating in an Oxford-style debate on February 11th against Josh Hammer. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=64.86s)]
*  We will be debating the U.S.-Israeli relationship and its effects on U.S. foreign policy at [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  Princeton, which is just a sad, sad comment on where we are as a society that I will be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=81.22s)]
*  debating at one of our prestigious college campuses. But I hope to see some of you guys [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=88.7s)]
*  out there. I am looking forward to it and I think it'll be a good time and an interesting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=92.88s)]
*  event. So, all right. All that being said, obviously, on the last episode, we foreshadowed [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=97.62s)]
*  this a little bit, but late last night, or maybe not late, I don't know. I think I just, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=105.82s)]
*  I'm an old man. I think I just go to sleep too early. I guess it wasn't that late. But [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=112.38s)]
*  yesterday evening, Donald Trump did come through on his promise that he made at the Libertarian [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=117.1s)]
*  Party National Convention. I was there and watched Donald Trump make this promise. I [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=124.66s)]
*  spoke before he did. And yeah, he came through and with a full pardon for Ross Ulbrich. That [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=130.14s)]
*  was something that was, it was not clear that that was going to be the case. A lot of us [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=138.7s)]
*  thought, I believe, you know, I'd actually have to go back and listen to it again, but [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=145.66s)]
*  I believe the language he had used at first was about commuting his sentence. I think, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=150.14s)]
*  I believe that was the initial promise. And we got more than that. We got a full pardon. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=156.18s)]
*  Ross Ulbrich was released from prison last night. He is home now. Or at least I assume. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=162.62s)]
*  To be fair, I don't actually know that he's home. I know he was released from prison. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=168.5s)]
*  I don't know if he wanted to make a couple stops before he went home. But he's a free [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  man. That much I know. Which is just amazing. It really, I just can't overstate how incredible [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  it is. As I mentioned on the last episode, I don't know Ross Ulbrich and I've never met [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=185.52s)]
*  him or had a conversation with him. I do know his mother fairly well and I've had many conversations [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=190.6s)]
*  with her. And I'm just so happy for Lynne Ulbrich and you know, that her nightmare comes to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=195.0s)]
*  an end is like just such a wonderful thing. And this is something that was, look, it's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=202.46s)]
*  an accomplishment that a lot of people should share credit for. And I think nobody deserves [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=210.28s)]
*  more credit than Lynne Ulbrich herself. You know, Lynne just worked tirelessly. It was [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=219.12s)]
*  just unbelievable how relentless that woman was. I mean, I saw her. She was out at so [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=227.16s)]
*  many different events for years and years and years. I mean, I remember, you know, it [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=232.16s)]
*  was, I think it was during the Obama administration that I first met Lynne. And the whole thing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=237.52s)]
*  just seemed completely hopeless. I mean, she was out just this mother who was trying to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=246.36s)]
*  get her son freed. But at the time it was like he lost in court. I believe he lost on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=252.12s)]
*  appeal. It was just like, listen, the feds decided to make an example out of this kid. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=259.76s)]
*  And what happens when the feds decide to make an example out of you? Well, you lose. That's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=266.0s)]
*  it. What are we going to do? You know, I mean, like, it was it was so sad because you would [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=272.12s)]
*  see it whenever you spoke to her. I mean, you would just see in her eyes, in her soul, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  the amount of pain that this woman was in. I mean, I met Lynne before I had kids. And [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  I remember being struck by it then. But there's just after having children, I think it you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=290.56s)]
*  know, and I have little kids, obviously, but there's there's something where you just [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=296.24s)]
*  understand it a little bit better. Like, imagine, imagine being in that situation where your [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=299.56s)]
*  kid is just rotting away in prison and has had their life robbed from them. I couldn't [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=304.36s)]
*  imagine anything more painful than that. I mean, I don't there's there's nothing you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=309.76s)]
*  could do to me that would be as painful as like living through that being done to one [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=314.92s)]
*  of your kids and just being helpless. And she just never stopped. She never stopped [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=320.04s)]
*  trying. And of course, you know, Donald Trump was already president for four years and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=325.04s)]
*  didn't pardon Ross. And so for this, you know, when you had essentially, you know, even [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=332.12s)]
*  going into this year, when the choice seemed to be between the current President Biden and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=338.0s)]
*  the former President Trump, both of whom have had the opportunity to and have not pardoned [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=343.32000000000005s)]
*  Ross, the thing seemed equally helpless. And then it got reinserted as a major issue [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=347.84s)]
*  during this campaign. And so Lynn deserves the most credit and as well as a whole bunch [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=355.52s)]
*  of like activists who kept this cause alive during those years when it did seem [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  hopeless. It seemed to me at the time that the free Ross thing was more of like, it was [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  more of like a tool that libertarians could use to point to what the state does to people [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=376.32s)]
*  and how it ruins people's lives. But I, you know, at least from my perspective, at the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  beginning, it never really seemed like it was practically achievable that we would actually [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=387.12s)]
*  get this guy free. That really changed. And it changed in large part when Angela [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=392.2s)]
*  McCardell invited Donald Trump to the Libertarian National Convention and made this one of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=401.68s)]
*  her, you know, I don't know how to say I was going to say central demands, but maybe that's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=408.8s)]
*  not exactly the right way to put it, but made it clear that this was something that that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=414.48s)]
*  libertarians cared about and that he would win a lot of support if he promised to do this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=419.88s)]
*  And ultimately was, you know, able to help him to get him to come through on this promise. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=425.0s)]
*  So like Angela McCardell deserves a ton of credit for this, as well as Michael Heiss and the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  entire Mises caucus that, you know, put her in to the chairmanship of the Libertarian Party. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=436.68s)]
*  Of course, also, I should mention, I know there's there's other people who probably deserve a lot [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=445.68s)]
*  of credit, too, but I should mention that, of course, it was Rand Paul in the Senate and [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  Thomas Massey in the House of Representatives, who kept bringing the issue up to Trump. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=453.48s)]
*  And I know that Rand Paul sent him a letter, I think just yesterday or the day before [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=459.8s)]
*  and asking him to please come through on this promise. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=466.52s)]
*  I know Thomas Massey has relentlessly worked for this cause. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=468.88s)]
*  And in fact, him and he was on Tim Cass last night and he read a letter that Ross had written [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=472.8s)]
*  him from prison. So like he was in communication with Russell Brick and and I'm sure with Lynn [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=477.24s)]
*  too. And so, you know, look, it's just this was kind of I would say and maybe we'll get [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=481.72s)]
*  a little bit more into this topic. But in terms of the libertarian movement, what's [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=489.04s)]
*  often called the Liberty Movement, just a lot of a lot of credit all around. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=495.6s)]
*  I mean, this was an issue that it's not just like it was like the libertarian activists [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=504.0s)]
*  and the the Libertarian Party. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=509.88s)]
*  And then, of course, the the few best members of Congress in the Senate who are the libertarians [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=513.28s)]
*  there, Rand Paul and Thomas Massey, who also happen to be the best two members of Congress [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=519.68s)]
*  during Covid and pretty much everything else. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=524.8399999999999s)]
*  But they really all came together, you know, and when I say they all came together, I don't [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  mean literally they all came together, but I mean that like there were all of these [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=534.12s)]
*  different components to this project and all of them were necessary in order to get it [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=538.16s)]
*  to come to fruition in the way that it did with, you know, a man's life being saved and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=543.8s)]
*  a mother's tragedy being ended, just kind of a beautiful story. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=550.52s)]
*  And I think something that libertarians feel very encouraged about, you know, obviously [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=554.68s)]
*  we're kind of up against it. We, you know, libertarians amongst libertarians, the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=560.48s)]
*  within, you know, debates about theory and philosophy, it's pretty much a consensus [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=568.04s)]
*  that the range of debate is about whether like 95 percent of the government shouldn't [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=575.96s)]
*  exist or 100 percent of the government shouldn't exist. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=582.72s)]
*  And then we debate within that spectrum. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=585.72s)]
*  No pun intended. So my point is just that libertarians in general are up against it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=588.72s)]
*  I mean, we live under the biggest, most powerful government in the history of the world, and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=596.24s)]
*  we either believe that 95 percent of that or 100 percent of it should be gone. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=600.36s)]
*  That's pretty daunting. It's a tall order. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=605.24s)]
*  And you're probably not going to get all of that done very easily, short of some major [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=607.6s)]
*  revolutionary change. But to get a win like this just feels nice, particularly when it's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=613.04s)]
*  somebody who we kind of personally know. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=620.64s)]
*  I mean, again, I don't know Ross, but I know his mother and so many people in the movement [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=624.56s)]
*  know her because she was just everywhere for many, many years now for the last decade, I [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=628.4799999999999s)]
*  guess. And. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=633.8s)]
*  It was just it was great. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=637.92s)]
*  You know, it's a signal from Donald Trump that he followed through on this promise. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  Of course, he did not have to. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=642.8399999999999s)]
*  And he he did. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=644.8s)]
*  And that says something. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=647.56s)]
*  I'm going to read what he wrote. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  So yesterday it was a this, I will say, and I was. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=650.92s)]
*  You know, I was as I said to you guys recently, I was cautiously optimistic that this would [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=659.8s)]
*  happen. I had, you know, I I have some people who are like close to the administration who [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=665.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm in communication with. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=673.9599999999999s)]
*  And then there's the things publicly that have been said. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=675.24s)]
*  And everything that I had heard. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=678.88s)]
*  It was indicating that this was going to happen. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=683.32s)]
*  So I was kind of, you know, now I've been around this game long enough to know that [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=687.76s)]
*  when you're relying on a politician's word, that's not necessarily the the safest place [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=692.2s)]
*  to be and that you never know what other types of forces are going to. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=699.32s)]
*  Persuade a politician once they're in power. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=706.08s)]
*  And so I was, you know, I was, as I said, cautiously optimistic about this, but I did. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  It did seem like it was going to happen for a while. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  I did not think we were going to get this, not just a full pardon, but the message that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=717.0s)]
*  Donald Trump sent. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=723.76s)]
*  And here it is. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=725.36s)]
*  OK, so Donald J. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=727.2s)]
*  Trump tweeted or perhaps he was at Truth Social or Twitter. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. He posted yesterday at 712 p.m. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=734.5600000000001s)]
*  I just called the mother of Ross Ulbrich to let her know that in honor of her and the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=741.0s)]
*  libertarian movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=747.72s)]
*  signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=753.2s)]
*  Ross, the scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=757.5200000000001s)]
*  in the modern day weaponization of government against me. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=764.5200000000001s)]
*  He was giving two life sentences plus 40 years. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=767.84s)]
*  Ridiculous explanation point. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=771.0s)]
*  Now, that, I must say, was particularly rewarding for me personally, not just that he [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=774.96s)]
*  credited the libertarian movement for pushing him to do this, but that he called the people [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=782.72s)]
*  who put Ross away scum. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=790.08s)]
*  I just loved that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=792.08s)]
*  I love that so much. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=793.6s)]
*  You know, in a lot of ways, the last so it's not quite 24 hours as I'm recording this [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=796.0400000000001s)]
*  now. What is it? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=803.12s)]
*  You know, 30 hours or so. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=804.12s)]
*  I've just I've been thinking a lot. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=807.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, I spent a few hours of those sleeping. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  But I have been thinking a lot about the libertarian movement, this accomplishment and [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  libertarianism in general. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=817.6s)]
*  And, you know, so I was right before I we came on here, I was just recording another [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=820.0s)]
*  episode of Piers Morgan. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=825.92s)]
*  So I was on I was on Piers Morgan, which was, you know, it was it's fun. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=828.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's always just too many people on these panels and you just don't get [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=833.6s)]
*  enough time. It's like five people and all these. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=836.64s)]
*  But I was arguing with one of the guys there and one of the things he brought up. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=838.72s)]
*  Just found this to be so interesting. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=845.24s)]
*  So he's like he's arguing with me about with the panel. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=847.24s)]
*  I don't know. I got a few words in. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=851.24s)]
*  But at one point, he was talking about how Donald Trump pardoned all the people from [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=852.96s)]
*  January 6th, including the violent ones and how horrible this is because these people [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=857.72s)]
*  are freed now. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=862.56s)]
*  And some of them like fought with police or something like that. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=863.44s)]
*  And I guess the argument was like, oh, he I think Piers Morgan said at one point, he [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=867.1600000000001s)]
*  should have pardoned the the nonviolent protesters at January 6th, but not the ones [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=871.96s)]
*  who got in the fights or smashed windows or whatever. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=879.12s)]
*  And the guy I can't remember his name, but the guy said at one point, he said, how do [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  you sleep at night knowing that these people are free? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=890.12s)]
*  And I just I found this to be a very interesting way to look at things. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=897.12s)]
*  And so my rejoinder to this, my counter was like, well, how do you sleep at night [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=900.44s)]
*  knowing that nonviolent people are locked in a cage? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=906.92s)]
*  I mean, like, I'm sorry, but I just cannot. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=911.12s)]
*  It's always been to me and maybe this is where the kind of bleeding heart libertarian [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=914.3599999999999s)]
*  thing comes in. But it's interesting. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=921.24s)]
*  You know, I remember one of the first pieces when I first discovered libertarianism, one [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=924.3599999999999s)]
*  of the first pieces I ever read was this this article by the greatest libertarian [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=928.5999999999999s)]
*  thinker who's ever lived, Murray Rothbard. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=934.16s)]
*  And it's called Great Peace, by the way, I highly recommend people go read it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=936.8399999999999s)]
*  It's called the Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=940.6s)]
*  And I loved this piece. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=946.36s)]
*  I still do. I reread it not that long ago. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=948.52s)]
*  But I remember the first time I ever read that, how much just seeing the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=952.72s)]
*  term right wing liberal. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=958.9200000000001s)]
*  And I just loved that because it's already just like. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=961.08s)]
*  It's like a paradigm shattering label. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=966.64s)]
*  You know, like that's just to most people, they're like, well, you can't be both of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=970.24s)]
*  those things. You have to be one or the other. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=972.92s)]
*  Right. Liberals over here on the left and right wing means over here on the right. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I remember this is all like early libertarian reading when I was first [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=979.12s)]
*  diving into this. But I remember when Ayn Rand was criticizing Rothbardian [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=985.4s)]
*  libertarians, what she called them and she meant this as a term of derision, like she [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=990.64s)]
*  was insulting us. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=994.8s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't have not me. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=996.04s)]
*  I wasn't a part of it then, but she was insulting, you know, what I ultimately am [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=997.52s)]
*  now. And she referred to us as right wing hippies. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1002.44s)]
*  And that was supposed to be like an insult, like, you know, you pretend to be right [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1007.96s)]
*  wing, but you're really a bunch of hippies. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1012.48s)]
*  And I remember the first time I read those words, just thinking to myself like, yeah, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1014.48s)]
*  that's that's perfect. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1021.24s)]
*  That's exactly what I am, a right wing hippie. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1023.36s)]
*  All right, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is My [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1026.4s)]

*  And even though a lot of people are very optimistic that Donald Trump is in office [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1035.24s)]
*  again, the truth is that no leader and no system can guarantee your protection. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1038.68s)]
*  That's why I protect my family with my Patriot Supply. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1043.24s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1077.24s)]
*  I think there's no better, like, describe her of how I view the world than being like a [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1079.1599999999999s)]
*  right wing hippie, which does sound like a contradiction to a lot of people. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1085.0s)]
*  But I don't think it is. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1089.56s)]
*  And I think that particularly, particularly after the last decade of kind of. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1091.1599999999999s)]
*  Insane woke ism. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1101.32s)]
*  There is this understand to an understandable correction to that or an [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1104.08s)]
*  understandable reaction to that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  Where and you see it all around you. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1113.4799999999998s)]
*  You see kind of like the rise of hardcore right wing ideology. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1114.9599999999998s)]
*  And in many cases, that's just you know, I was tweeting about this earlier, but it's [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1121.08s)]
*  like, I understand why that happens. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1125.9199999999998s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1128.24s)]
*  I understand that when you're seeing things like when you're seeing like a dude in a [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1129.08s)]
*  dress, giving a lap dance to an 11 year old, and then you're being told, but not by [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1137.36s)]
*  random people online, but by all of the most powerful, you know, power centers in [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1143.56s)]
*  society that you're a bigot. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1147.9199999999998s)]
*  If you call this out, you're a, you're a racist or whatever, not racist, but you [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1150.32s)]
*  know, the transphobe or whatever. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1154.96s)]
*  If you have something to say about this or even things like, you know, I was on that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1157.08s)]
*  chick, Riley Gaines joined the panel while I was on Pierce Morgan, because you know, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1162.96s)]
*  it's Pierce Morgan. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1168.28s)]
*  So just more people keep coming in when you're in the middle of a panel. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1168.84s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1171.68s)]
*  But so if you're not familiar, she was the one who was like, she was the female swimmer [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1173.36s)]
*  who was like essentially robbed of her, like trophy. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1183.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't remember exactly what she going to get gold, but she got silver because that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1187.96s)]
*  Leah Thompson, the guy just was, took the first place in women's sports or whatever. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1191.8000000000002s)]
*  But anyway, she was talking about how, you know, her story is that she was like forced [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1197.92s)]
*  to change with this guy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1204.16s)]
*  So like they would have the women's swim team. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1206.52s)]
*  And then there's this guy who identifies as a woman with full male genitalia, as she [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1209.6000000000001s)]
*  tells it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1216.0s)]
*  And all of the girls were like forced to change with her. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1216.8400000000001s)]
*  And they were all like, this is insane. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, and it's like, even as she's telling the story, I'm like, in my mind, I'm just [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  like, Oh, I mean, like, I don't want to be careful in what I say on microphone here. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1226.0s)]
*  But if anyone ever tried to force my wife or daughter to change in the presence of a [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1232.28s)]
*  man, when they were uncomfortable with that, like I'd be ready to kill someone over [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1237.28s)]
*  that, you know, and like, and then to be to be called a bigot because you have the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1242.56s)]
*  impulse to. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1246.84s)]
*  So what ends up happening, though, is that then you have this woke thing and then it [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1248.16s)]
*  leads to the rise of like hardcore right wing ideology in response to it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1253.72s)]
*  When you see a man in a dress giving a lap dance to an 11 year old and then everyone [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1258.12s)]
*  tells you you're a bigot if you have a problem with this. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1263.72s)]
*  People like the tweet that says put them up against the wall is going to be a lot more [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1267.52s)]
*  satisfying than a tweet about individual liberty and like, well, while I don't agree [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1272.68s)]
*  with your choice, you have the right to do this, but you don't have the right to inflict [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1279.0s)]
*  it on children. And like, you're not going to get like a calm, sober, thoughtful [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1282.28s)]
*  reaction to that type of stuff. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1288.72s)]
*  You're going to get people racing in the other direction. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1290.28s)]
*  You know, and. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1293.08s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1295.3999999999999s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1297.24s)]
*  I do, however, think that at a certain point, it's incumbent on adults to be adults [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1298.72s)]
*  and to actually think about what kind of society we want to leave for our children. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1306.28s)]
*  You know, if you're like if you're going to be in this world of talking about politics [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1311.4399999999998s)]
*  and talking about policy and talking about things that matter, I do think you have an [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1315.52s)]
*  obligation to try like I'm not saying you can't ever shitpost or you can't ever talk [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1319.56s)]
*  shit online or you can't ever like troll or say things like I'm not saying that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1324.4s)]
*  I'm guilty of it as much as anybody. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1328.44s)]
*  But I do think there at a certain point, you also have to like try to rise above that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1330.6s)]
*  and not just be contrarian or reactionary and actually think about like, hey, what are [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1335.92s)]
*  we trying to do here? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1341.8s)]
*  You know, I was having a phone call. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1342.96s)]
*  I was on the phone with Connor Freeman the other day, who's great, by the way, really, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1345.96s)]
*  really love that guy. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  He's if people don't know, he's at the Libertarian Institute and antiwar.com. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1353.3200000000002s)]
*  He's been on the show before and we're going to have him back on again soon. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1358.24s)]
*  But I was on the phone with him. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1361.64s)]
*  Very, very smart guy. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1363.5200000000002s)]
*  And he said this was a private conversation. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1364.8400000000001s)]
*  But I don't think I don't think Connor would mind me saying this publicly. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1366.8400000000001s)]
*  But, you know, he said something that really made me think. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1370.16s)]
*  And it was about like a little Twitter interaction that we had had where I was talking [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1372.96s)]
*  about one of the, you know, for libertarians who know this is an issue I've been kind of [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1379.76s)]
*  going to war with other libertarians about for a few years now. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1385.3200000000002s)]
*  But I was talking about like the libertarian position on public property and, you know, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1388.3600000000001s)]
*  what how I don't believe that it is the correct libertarian answer that like homeless [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1393.72s)]
*  people should just be allowed to sleep on the streets and form homeless encampments. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1398.52s)]
*  And I don't think they have a right to do that. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1401.68s)]
*  I don't think any of us have a right to do that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1403.8000000000002s)]
*  And so anyway, it came off of Liz Wolf, who's also been on the show a couple of times. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1406.0800000000002s)]
*  She had posted something like she posted a picture of like a junkie sleeping in a [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1413.2s)]
*  playground. And I had responded with something about physical removal, kind of like a [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1419.6000000000001s)]
*  nod to Hoppean theory. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1426.0s)]
*  And, you know, I was talking about it with Connor on the phone and he was basically [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1428.44s)]
*  saying that he was like, look, I completely agree with you on the policy. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1433.88s)]
*  Of course, I don't think that homeless people should be allowed to sleep in [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1437.64s)]
*  playgrounds. They should be removed from there. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1442.48s)]
*  However, he said he was like, there should also be some message of compassion. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1445.04s)]
*  It shouldn't just be that like, hey, libertarians are the hardcore people who are for [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1450.3600000000001s)]
*  kicking these homeless people out of here. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1455.2s)]
*  There should also be some message about like what we would do to deal with the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1457.16s)]
*  homeless situation or what policies lead to homelessness and all of this. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1460.52s)]
*  And, you know, I had to concede as he was saying this that perhaps I've been a [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1464.04s)]
*  little colored by the years of battling wokeism and that includes battling like [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  goofy woke libertarians. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1475.68s)]
*  But at a certain point, you're like, yeah, I don't want it to come off like my only [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1477.4s)]
*  message here is like one of cruelty. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1481.2s)]
*  And anyway, that's just something that is like a broader thought that I've had for [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1483.68s)]
*  quite a while. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1489.84s)]
*  And there is in this case with Ross Ulbrich, especially having Donald Trump, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  the most famous, you know, the leader of the right wing in America, calling the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1498.96s)]
*  prosecutor's scum for locking him up, which was something, you know, like I was [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1504.48s)]
*  I was hoping Ross's sentence was going to get commuted. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1510.04s)]
*  I was blown away by a full pardon. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1512.6000000000001s)]
*  I was grateful that he, you know, that he gave credit to the Liberty movement. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1514.72s)]
*  But then, you know, calling him scum, it's that what's the old Vince McMahon meme [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1520.88s)]
*  where he's just getting more and more excited. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1525.64s)]
*  That was the last Vince McMahon face was me when he calls him scum like, ah, this [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1527.8s)]
*  is just too great to be true. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1532.4s)]
*  But I did think it was like a really interesting time to kind of bring up some [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1535.56s)]
*  of these issues and to challenge people to like actually consider to consider [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1539.92s)]
*  this stuff and to think about this, like in terms of who we are as a society and [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1547.0800000000002s)]
*  what we support, you know, back to the guy on Piers Morgan, you know, who's saying, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1552.16s)]
*  how do you live with yourself? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1556.0s)]
*  How do you live with yourself knowing that someone who fought with a cop is free? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1558.72s)]
*  Four years later. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1565.48s)]
*  Like, I just like think about that for a second, like four years in prison is a long [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1567.68s)]
*  time to spend in prison. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1573.44s)]
*  The idea that you should be losing sleep over someone getting in a fight. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1575.32s)]
*  That they're not what doing five years, 10 years, 20 years in prison. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1582.08s)]
*  Like, is that really does that make sense? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1586.48s)]
*  And meanwhile, you're not even thinking to yourself like that. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1589.4s)]
*  Are you losing sleep over the fact? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1592.0s)]
*  I'll say this, right? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1594.32s)]
*  You know how, like, if you ever even just like when you were in school, if you ever [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1596.2s)]
*  read about like slavery or the Holocaust or some genocide or some horrible war or, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1601.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, just read about like one of like one of the many atrocities in human history [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  and you would just kind of have a feeling of like, Jesus Christ, like human beings [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1614.0400000000002s)]
*  actually did that. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1618.2s)]
*  Like, this is just like there was slavery and other people just accepted this. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1619.8000000000002s)]
*  They just accepted the idea that you could own a human being and treat them as livestock [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1624.2s)]
*  and like, Jesus Christ. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1629.16s)]
*  Now, how did people like lose their minds so much that they accepted this? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1631.0s)]
*  Well, I've always, you know, I've always kind of been interested in the idea from [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1635.96s)]
*  back 20 years ago when I first became a libertarian. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1642.64s)]
*  The thing that would always be interesting to me was like, what, what like that is [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1646.24s)]
*  going on in our society right now that we just have a blind spot to that if we were [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1650.6s)]
*  alive, you know, in a hundred years and people would look at us and go like, you know, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1656.0s)]
*  how the hell did you guys put up with that? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1660.48s)]
*  And we'd be like, oh, wow, I never really thought about it like that. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1662.6399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, the things that always struck me as the most obvious was war and [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1665.9199999999998s)]
*  imprisoning people for nonviolent victimless crimes. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1677.76s)]
*  It just seemed so obvious to me, like as I started reading all this libertarian stuff, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1681.44s)]
*  that it was like, yeah, look, it's right there. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1685.8799999999999s)]
*  We're doing this right there. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1688.2s)]
*  We still have slavery. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1689.04s)]
*  We just have it by another name. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1690.72s)]
*  It's like people are, I mean, what are you when you're in prison? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1692.68s)]
*  You're a slave. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1696.44s)]
*  You're a slave of the government down to the fact that they do labor. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1697.32s)]
*  You know, I mean, like, but you're a slave. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1700.48s)]
*  Your liberty is taken. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1702.32s)]
*  You're thrown in a cage to be raped or tortured or beaten or threatened like an [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1704.36s)]
*  animal, you know, and then you think to yourself like, well, what, what, like if [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1711.16s)]
*  you just stripped away everything else, you knew, and we were just talking about [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1717.8799999999999s)]
*  morality, like what's right and what's wrong. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1722.24s)]
*  And I would have proposed to you this idea that we're going to throw human [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1724.8799999999999s)]
*  beings into cages, shackle them, rob them of their lives, of their liberty. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1728.8799999999999s)]
*  And again, like I said, I'm being slightly hyperbolic, but like when I say to be [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1733.9599999999998s)]
*  raped and tortured, I mean, you know, this is all this is like accepted. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1738.32s)]
*  It's like a, if you watch like any cop show, like law and order or something [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1742.9199999999998s)]
*  like that, it's like a punchline in the shows. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1748.8s)]
*  Like they use the good, the good guys who are the cops in the shows, they will use [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1752.8s)]
*  this threat against sometimes innocent people. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1758.48s)]
*  Like, like this is how much we just culturally accept this. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1761.08s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm talking about? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1764.52s)]
*  Like when they're, you know, they'll be like, they'll, they'll be interrogating [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1765.8s)]
*  one, like wimpy guy who maybe knows something about the crime and isn't telling [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1770.0s)]
*  them or something like that, not even like the guy guilty of the crime, but like [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1774.48s)]
*  they'll just be interrogating some guy and they'll be like, Oh, we've got you on [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1777.44s)]
*  this and on this, you know, guys like you don't do very well in jail. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1780.76s)]
*  And that's just like, that's just like a, I don't know, totally accepted. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1786.0s)]
*  So yeah, the cop here is just threatening you with the fact that you will probably [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1792.24s)]
*  be raped in this dungeon that they're going to throw you into. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  So like, okay, if I was just talking to you about morality and none of this stuff [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1801.0s)]
*  existed and I was just saying like, that's the situation. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1805.32s)]
*  And then I were to ask you like, when is it morally acceptable to throw someone in [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1808.12s)]
*  the cage to maybe be raped and tortured and have their life and liberty robbed [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1813.36s)]
*  from them? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1817.6s)]
*  When is it acceptable? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1818.28s)]
*  And I mean, like, what could you come up with? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1820.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1822.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1822.56s)]
*  Fine. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1822.9599999999998s)]
*  You could say like, maybe like murderers or like brutally violent criminals. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1823.28s)]
*  Maybe you could get there with like property damage and things like that. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1828.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1831.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that is a real violation of somebody's rights, but I mean, Jesus, to [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1832.3999999999999s)]
*  get there over a victimless nonviolent crime, like it's just, and that's what I love [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1839.0s)]
*  about Donald Trump calling these people scum is that it's like, yeah, think about [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1844.6000000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1849.2s)]
*  Like who morally speaking, not legally, who are the real criminals here? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1849.44s)]
*  Ross Ulbricht for creating a website or these prosecutors who would give somebody [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1854.48s)]
*  two life sentences plus 40 years for creating that website. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1860.68s)]
*  And to be clear, you know, that's a, oh yeah, Natalie put in, it's a great point [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1867.16s)]
*  that don't drop the soap. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1872.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1874.48s)]
*  That's a punchline. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1874.64s)]
*  It's a punchline. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1875.8s)]
*  That's like, yeah, ha ha. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1877.2s)]
*  People get raped in jail. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1879.48s)]
*  Like this is, it's just, it's madness. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1880.72s)]
*  It's, it is the example of the thing in a hundred years that you'd be reading about [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1883.52s)]
*  and that they don't do this anymore. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1887.96s)]
*  And they go, how the hell did you ever do this? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1889.1200000000001s)]
*  And you'd be like, oh yeah, that does. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1890.88s)]
*  Oof. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1892.68s)]
*  I guess when you look at it like that, it is kind of. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1893.3600000000001s)]
*  Indefensible. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1896.64s)]

*  It's the most comfortable pair of boxer briefs you will ever own. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1910.6000000000001s)]
*  They use a moisture wicking technology to create underwear that keeps everything [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1913.5600000000002s)]

*  You know, they're great in hot weather because they're very breathable, but they're [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1920.92s)]
*  also just great in the cold. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1924.16s)]
*  I'm in very cold weather right now and I'm loving my sheath underwear. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1925.4s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1953.6s)]
*  Um, so yeah, anyway, but what you're talking about this now in the case of [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1955.24s)]
*  Ross Ulbricht, you know, it's so absurd that so he, he basically, he created the [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1960.96s)]
*  Silk Road, which is like a website, it was a marketplace. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1967.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1969.68s)]
*  And so the accusation was that people were selling drugs on that marketplace and [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1970.4s)]
*  people were laundering money on the marketplace. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1974.92s)]
*  And therefore he's responsible for it. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1977.2399999999998s)]
*  It would be on the level. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1979.52s)]
*  You remember when Mark Zuckerberg in his little announcement that he's going to [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1980.9199999999998s)]
*  let people speak on Facebook, when he said a couple of weeks ago that we have a [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1984.36s)]
*  real problem with child trafficking on Facebook or whatever, like, I don't even [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1987.6399999999999s)]
*  know the, I don't know anything about that, but imagine if someone were to ever [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1991.28s)]
*  say, that's why we're going to give Mark Zuckerberg 60 life sentences in jail [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=1995.08s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2000.84s)]
*  I just pulled 60 out of my ass. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2002.08s)]
*  Cause you know, it's on a much bigger scale than the Silk Road was, but like, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2003.36s)]
*  we, it'd be like on the level of like, um, you know, somebody made a phone call [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2008.12s)]
*  and was plotting a murder. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2013.4399999999998s)]
*  Therefore we're going to throw the CEO of AT&T in jail for multiple life [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2015.08s)]
*  sentences, like, this is just insane. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2023.1999999999998s)]
*  No one would ever think this way, but okay. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2025.8s)]
*  As long as we got Donald Trump calling these people scum, this is something that [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2029.52s)]
*  the American people should be thinking about because Ross Ulbrich is just one [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2035.44s)]
*  case and he is far from the only one. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2039.44s)]
*  And particularly after what happened with the January 6th people and what [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2042.3200000000002s)]
*  happened with Donald Trump himself and the charges he was facing. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2046.24s)]
*  I mean, you see how much this is a part of what we call our justice system, where [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2050.04s)]
*  when there's somebody who they have an ax to grind against, you know, when [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2057.76s)]
*  there's somebody they want to make an example out of, or maybe just for [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2061.48s)]
*  political reasons, want to remove this person, the system can be so vicious. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2065.52s)]
*  You know, just like unbelievable. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2071.04s)]
*  And it is insane how many people are sitting in jail cells right now in this [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2073.52s)]
*  country over victimless nonviolent crimes. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2078.48s)]
*  It's in the hundreds of thousands at least, you know, you're talking about [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2081.44s)]
*  crimes like the crime of owning a gun, not hurting anybody, not shooting anybody, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2085.6s)]
*  not threatening anybody, but just having a gun or maybe you had a gun and then you, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2090.6s)]
*  you know, drove from like, I don't know, like Philadelphia to Camden, New Jersey [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2095.92s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2101.8399999999997s)]
*  And now you've crossed state lines with an illegal weapon. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2102.72s)]
*  And now, and you're looking at like multiple decades sentences, how many [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2105.8399999999997s)]
*  people are in jail over drugs, over distribution of drugs? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2110.44s)]
*  I mean, like, Jesus Christ. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2115.48s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2118.48s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2119.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you want to actually like get down to a point where we're not just like, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2121.0s)]
*  we're not just being reactionary against the woke and we're not just owning the [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2126.68s)]
*  libs and we're not just saying like the thing that feels like the most hardcore [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2130.64s)]
*  bad-ass thing we could say, don't get me wrong. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2134.36s)]
*  I've done that myself a time or two. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2137.08s)]
*  I understand the appeal of it, but there is something that is immature about it. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2139.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like at a certain point, you kind of like have to be the adult in [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2143.6s)]
*  the room and think about what type of society we want for our kids. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2147.52s)]
*  Then I would say one where like nobody's kid gets treated the way Ross Albrecht [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2151.32s)]
*  does, that nobody is at risk of ever the fact that the fact that it could ever be [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2155.48s)]
*  the case in the United States of America, that you could get a double life sentence [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2162.88s)]
*  plus 40 years for creating a website for a nonviolent victimless crime. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2170.52s)]
*  That is madness. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2177.2s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2179.4s)]
*  And it's enough that every American should look at that and just be appalled. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2180.7599999999998s)]
*  Like that should never be allowed to happen in a professed free society. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2184.68s)]
*  It's a disgrace. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2190.44s)]
*  And you know, I'm just really glad Donald Trump pardoned him, but I'm so glad that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2192.2s)]
*  he also like brought attention to like who the real criminals are here. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2197.4s)]
*  I didn't even know the bit about him saying that some of the prosecutors were the [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2201.04s)]
*  same people involved in coming after him. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2204.6s)]
*  I didn't know anything about that, but that does, you know, it's interesting. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2206.44s)]
*  And you'd understand why that would give Donald Trump a little added motivation to [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2211.88s)]
*  want to call them out for that. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2216.2000000000003s)]
*  But the truth is that they've been doing this to the American people for years. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2217.8s)]
*  And I do think that this is something that all Americans should look at and think [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2222.52s)]
*  about no matter what side of it you're on. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  You know? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2232.16s)]
*  I mean, look, personally, like I'm just making the appeal right now that it's just [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2233.32s)]
*  wrong to do that to anyone for anything short of like a brutal, violent crime. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2237.2s)]
*  Like, look, by the way, it's debatable whether this is the best way to handle [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2242.6s)]
*  brutal, violent crime, to be honest. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2247.08s)]
*  Like it's kind of crazy. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2248.88s)]
*  Like, I don't know, maybe there's a better solution we could come up with. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2249.7599999999998s)]
*  The whole idea of prison to me seems like something that should have existed in the [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2253.0s)]
*  1600s and we found some better way now. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2258.44s)]
*  But OK, I'm not going to go to bat for like brutal, violent criminals. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2261.56s)]
*  So fine. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2264.8s)]
*  If you want to say they get thrown in prison for long sentences, OK. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2265.28s)]
*  But my God, for anybody like a nonviolent, victimless crime, it's just insane. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2268.36s)]
*  It's just pure evil to support this. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2273.84s)]
*  But even if you could move beyond just the moral argument of it, I mean, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2276.76s)]
*  think about it like this. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2280.88s)]
*  Like to left wingers, look who's in charge of the government right now. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2282.2s)]
*  You really want the government having that type of power? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2288.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, like you better be really confident that it's only going to be used [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2291.16s)]
*  in your favor if you're going to support that type of power. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2295.3999999999996s)]
*  And to the right wingers, it was like, hey, you guys might be in power now, but you just [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2298.8399999999997s)]
*  saw what it was like when you weren't. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2304.08s)]
*  And you have no guarantee that you're going to be in power forever. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  You've got two years of having the Congress and four years of having the presidency, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2308.72s)]
*  all but guaranteed. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2314.52s)]
*  But that's that's not that long. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2316.0s)]
*  And you might think to yourself, man, like this is a power you really would not like [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2319.1200000000003s)]
*  your political enemies to have and wield over you. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2323.32s)]
*  And then that in itself should be enough of a reason to oppose this stuff. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2326.6800000000003s)]
*  It is just. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2333.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, it. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2334.84s)]
*  It's just the case that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2336.6000000000004s)]
*  This stuff, if the government has this power, it will be weaponized for political reasons. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  That's that's how it works. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2346.6800000000003s)]
*  Things that politicians have control of are by definition political. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2348.6000000000004s)]
*  And you you do not want your political enemies to have this type of this type of power, to [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2353.0400000000004s)]
*  violate people's basic liberty and humanity in this way. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2359.0400000000004s)]
*  And and it's just the case that like people get people get railroaded by the legal [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2363.7200000000003s)]
*  system all the time as go look through the amount of like DNA records that have overturned [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2369.36s)]
*  convictions. I mean, there's people. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2376.2400000000002s)]
*  That are straight up like on death row and have been let go because the technology came [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2378.28s)]
*  out years later to just prove that it was not them. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2382.96s)]
*  They just got totally railroaded by the system. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2386.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's it's tragic. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2389.48s)]
*  It's it's that a certain point we got to decide who we want to be as a society. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2391.84s)]
*  And if we want to be the freest country in the world, like, is that what we want? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2396.8s)]
*  Or do we want to be the country that leads the world in throwing their own people in [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2404.28s)]
*  prison, the most and the harshest and for the longest period of time? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2409.04s)]
*  Because you cannot be both. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2413.36s)]
*  You can be one or the other. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2415.28s)]
*  You know, you can you can lead the world in freedom or you can lead the world in [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2417.32s)]
*  imprisoning your own citizens. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2421.96s)]
*  You can't have both of those. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2424.16s)]
*  So that that is just something that I, you know, I felt like now is the time that to [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2426.08s)]
*  bring it up. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2432.56s)]
*  I think it's a. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2434.2s)]
*  It's great. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2436.44s)]
*  It's great that this happened. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2438.44s)]
*  It's great that he called them all scumbags. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2440.0s)]
*  And that's something that people should really think about. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2442.2s)]
*  It's it's you know, the for Lynn Albrook's nightmare being ruined. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2446.36s)]
*  There's so many other mothers out there whose nightmares are, you know, just still [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2451.96s)]
*  going. And again, I will say that. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2456.2s)]
*  You know, even Donald Trump is not good on the war on drugs and he's not, you know, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2459.64s)]
*  and and so many right wingers aren't particularly in this era where there's been [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2464.6s)]
*  essentially there's been a ridiculous absence of rules and law enforcement in [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2472.16s)]
*  major cities across the country. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2477.8399999999997s)]
*  And I don't get me wrong. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2479.4399999999996s)]
*  I think all of that stuff is insane. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2480.48s)]
*  It's insane to like. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2482.8399999999997s)]
*  Essentially get rid of the penalties for violent crimes. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2485.56s)]
*  Nobody is nobody here, at least, is suggesting that, like, if you carjack [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2490.2799999999997s)]
*  somebody, you shouldn't be arrested and prosecuted for that. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2494.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm certainly not suggesting that there shouldn't be penalties for, you know, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2498.44s)]
*  shoplifting, property damage, things like that. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2504.68s)]
*  But. You know, it would I think that especially in 2024, when it comes to like [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2507.72s)]
*  the issue of drugs, because of course, this was one of the charges that Ross [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2514.96s)]
*  Albrook got was that people were selling drugs on his website. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2519.36s)]
*  Therefore, he facilitated the sale of drugs. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2523.88s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, by the way, that this never applies to the powerful. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2527.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2533.04s)]
*  Like, nobody ever makes the argument that like, hey, you know, all of these drug [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2533.8s)]
*  dealers are trading in dollars. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2538.5600000000004s)]
*  Like they're using cash. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2542.44s)]
*  Therefore, I think the chairman of the Federal Reserve should go to prison for [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2544.48s)]
*  four life sentences, you know, like no one isn't that convenient. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2548.36s)]
*  It never seems to apply to the actual powerful people. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2551.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2554.6400000000003s)]
*  Nobody, like I said before, is saying the owner of, you know, telephone companies [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2555.2400000000002s)]
*  or, you know, even the big tech platforms or anything like that should be [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2559.6s)]
*  criminally prosecuted for what somebody did on their platform. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2564.7599999999998s)]
*  But, you know, on the topic of drugs in general, and I think that I'm hoping that [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2570.8399999999997s)]
*  the new generation could perhaps be a bit more enlightened and a bit more grown up [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2576.72s)]
*  than like the baby boomers who were just, I mean, you know, for coming out of the [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2584.08s)]
*  hippies, they really just became like the most, I don't even know, like the most, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2588.76s)]
*  just had a very simplistic and kind of stupid way of thinking about all these [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2596.88s)]
*  things. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2601.36s)]
*  But look, I'll just say this. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2601.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2604.28s)]
*  And I say this as somebody like I'm not endorsing drug use. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2604.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't, I don't use drugs. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2610.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, you know, depending on your definition, like I am helplessly [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2614.48s)]
*  addicted to nicotine and caffeine and I do enjoy a nice bourbon. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2618.24s)]
*  So I'm not like, you know, I'm not a square or something like that, but I'm a [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2625.0s)]
*  guy and I've talked about this on the show before. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2630.24s)]
*  I was a serious pothead for many, many years, starting at a very young age. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2632.16s)]
*  I smoked weed every single day, all day long, as much as I could afford to from [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2638.3199999999997s)]
*  the basically like 13 to 30 something. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2643.4s)]
*  And it's something I regret. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2648.6s)]
*  I would not advise it for young people. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2651.32s)]
*  I don't think, you know, every day smoking weed all day long, I don't think [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2653.88s)]
*  it's good for you. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2657.36s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people who are, do smoke weed like that would benefit [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2658.44s)]
*  from cutting down or stopping altogether. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2664.6800000000003s)]
*  I think that a lot of people make excuses to themselves and a lot of the people who [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2668.6s)]
*  smoke weed like that, they know, they'd probably be better off not, but it's hard. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2673.48s)]
*  You know, you get, you fall into habits and I'm certainly like, I don't, I don't [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2678.48s)]
*  do any like hard drugs. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2683.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, and so it's not, I'm not like saying like, Oh, drugs are great, or I'm not [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2685.7200000000003s)]
*  downplaying the negative effects of drugs. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2690.4s)]
*  I'm just saying, let's have a, like a bit more of an adult, honest conversation [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2694.0s)]
*  about drugs, if we're going to be throwing people in jail for life over them. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2699.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2705.04s)]
*  And, and first off, just to the point I made before about like the powerful and [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2705.64s)]
*  how this never like, it seems to affect them. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2708.92s)]
*  You want to talk about drug dealers. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2711.72s)]
*  You want to talk about drug use, but what you're not going to look at big pharma. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2714.36s)]
*  You're not going to look at the fact that they've made, they've institutionalized [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2719.2s)]
*  putting children on methamphetamines. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2724.04s)]
*  We're not going to point that out at all. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2726.96s)]
*  Go by the way, do a little bit of research on the history of Adderall, the [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2728.7599999999998s)]
*  history of some of these ADD drugs. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2733.92s)]
*  Look into what they are. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2738.4s)]
*  Look into how they came about. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2740.24s)]
*  It is insane, insane that they prescribe them to eight year olds liberally. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2742.24s)]
*  It's like a, but, Oh, are any of those people going to go to jail? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2748.3199999999997s)]
*  Huh? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2751.92s)]
*  Are they? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2752.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2754.0s)]
*  It's also just like, you know, you can recognize what I just said about [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2755.48s)]
*  drugs, not being so great for you. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2761.32s)]
*  And maybe like, you know, the, the, uh, sober life is a better way to live than [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2763.28s)]
*  one where you're using drugs recklessly. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2770.04s)]
*  Now you, you could also argue, and it is true that there's a lot of people who [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2772.84s)]
*  use drugs recreational, but they do it in moderation and they don't mess up their [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2775.96s)]
*  lives and I don't know, you know, who are you or anyone else to tell them? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2780.48s)]
*  That, uh, that they're doing it wrong. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2785.28s)]
*  If they're enjoying it and they're still being productive and being good [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2787.52s)]
*  members of their community or whatever. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2791.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, I saw somebody, because again, this, um, this, this right wing, uh, kind [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2793.48s)]
*  of overreaction is so popular these days. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2798.6s)]
*  But I remember I saw someone, uh, um, tweeting and it was a tweet that like [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2801.36s)]
*  really blew up and a lot of people were agreeing with that, where they were like, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2805.2400000000002s)]
*  I've never met a successful pothead in my life. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2807.96s)]
*  And as somebody who's not like an advocate of, of smoking weed, it's like, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2811.44s)]
*  well, you just, that's more of a comment on who you know, then it is a comment on [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2815.7599999999998s)]
*  pot, cause I know a lot of them and it's like, I know a lot of very, very [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2820.3599999999997s)]
*  successful people who smoke weed. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2825.24s)]
*  So again, it's not, I'm just saying, let's talk about this like adults. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2826.56s)]
*  Let's talk about what's really going on in our society. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2832.4s)]
*  And, you know, the, even drugs that are seen as so taboo, like cocaine, for [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2835.56s)]
*  example, um, you know, how many people in the Fox news building do you think [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2841.96s)]
*  have used cocaine, you know, in the, in the Fox news where the boomer cons get [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2848.7200000000003s)]
*  their news from, okay. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2854.1600000000003s)]
*  And they're watching, you know, Sean Hannity or whoever, and there's just [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2855.76s)]
*  very, you know, if the topic were to come up on air, it would be like drugs, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2859.0s)]
*  the scourge of society. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2863.32s)]
*  How many of them you think are doing a bump in the bathroom at the [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2864.7200000000003s)]
*  bar after the show? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2867.44s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2869.2400000000002s)]
*  It ain't zero. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2870.7200000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2871.8s)]
*  And the answer is a lot, a lot of them are, but we're somehow supposed to [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2873.1600000000003s)]
*  pretend that that doesn't exist. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2877.52s)]
*  And then we'll create a system where you can, if you're caught. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2879.6800000000003s)]
*  And I mean, look, in, in some areas, these laws have been like changed a bit, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2884.76s)]
*  but it is still the case that like, if you're caught with like even possession [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2889.04s)]
*  of like cocaine, it, depending on the state that you're in, you could be [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2894.28s)]
*  looking at like easily 10 years, 20 years in prison. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2898.44s)]
*  Now it is true that the majority, because this is the way the system is set up. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2903.48s)]
*  It is true that the majority case, if you have no record and that's all you've [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2907.6800000000003s)]
*  been caught with, you're probably not going to actually do 10 to 20 years, but [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2911.8s)]
*  there's still something to be said where you're looking at that type of sentence. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2916.12s)]
*  And then you're in a position where, of course, you just have to take whatever [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2919.7599999999998s)]
*  plea deal they offer you because your life is on the line, you know? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2922.8399999999997s)]
*  And think about what, think about what 10 years in prison is, not like in some [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2926.44s)]
*  abstract sense with someone else. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2930.2s)]
*  Like if it were you or your family member, that was something you were [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2931.7599999999998s)]
*  looking at 10 years in prison. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2935.6s)]
*  What is that? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2937.52s)]
*  Oh, that's robbing your life from you. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2938.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2940.52s)]
*  I mean, you put, you put me in prison right now for 10 years. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2941.88s)]
*  That means I'm away from my kids from ages, you know, three to 13. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2945.3599999999997s)]
*  I come back in their life when they're grown. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2950.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2953.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, not grown, but not little children anymore. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2954.24s)]
*  You'd be, you'd be just destroying my life to do that to me. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2958.4799999999996s)]
*  Um, I'm sure that's true for everybody listening. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2962.3999999999996s)]
*  And like, so of course, so we have this system set up and what is it basically? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2965.8799999999997s)]
*  It's that, oh, okay. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2970.8399999999997s)]
*  So all of those people at Fox news who use cocaine, by the way, um, and many of [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2972.16s)]
*  them drink and smoke pot and take pills and things like that, how many of them [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2979.04s)]
*  are going to go face one of these really long jail sentences for that? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2983.08s)]
*  Zero. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=2986.3199999999997s)]

*  disastrous and it's so, what's so interesting to me, you know, I know I [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3110.48s)]
*  mentioned this, uh, briefly the other day, um, when I was talking about [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3114.68s)]
*  Trump's terrible idea about designating, uh, the cartels as terrorists. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3118.56s)]
*  I, and I was like, oh, you're going to combine the war on drugs and the [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3123.3599999999997s)]
*  war on terrorism and that ought to really succeed. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3125.8399999999997s)]
*  But, you know, I think I made the point like about prohibition. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3128.84s)]
*  Um, and one of the things that's really interesting is that this was even [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3134.6s)]
*  taught in government schools. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3138.08s)]
*  Like this was, you know, it's kind of, it reminds me of, um, you know, the, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3139.68s)]
*  like even in government school, I was taught at least as a kid that, um, and I [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3144.24s)]
*  don't know what they're still teaching today, but at least this was taught when [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3151.12s)]
*  I was a kid was that it was kind of common wisdom that we fucked up after [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3153.72s)]
*  world war one and we were way too harsh on the Germans and we enforced the [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3160.48s)]
*  treaty of Versailles on them. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3166.0s)]
*  And this led to the rise of the Nazis. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3167.2s)]
*  Even in government school, that was like, admit it, you know, and they'd never [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3169.68s)]
*  admit anything else about a lot of these other wars, but at least that was kind [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3173.2s)]
*  of acknowledged and yet that never stopped us from like, say when we were [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3176.3599999999997s)]
*  doing the exact same thing to the Russians after the fall of the Soviet [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3179.8799999999997s)]
*  Union from being like, Oh, but didn't we learn we're not supposed to do this? [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3182.6s)]
*  And the other one is prohibition. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3185.88s)]
*  That prohibition of alcohol was at least to me was taught the correct way. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3187.88s)]
*  And there are so few things in history that were actually taught to me the [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3193.72s)]
*  correct way in school, but this was one of them. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3198.04s)]
*  And I'm sure I'm not the only one. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3200.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, I'm sure a lot of people, at least around my age, got the same thing that [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3202.2799999999997s)]
*  it was like, look, here was the plan. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3205.92s)]
*  Alcohol leads to all of these negative outcomes. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3208.88s)]
*  And so they thought the idea was we would prohibit it and that would make things [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3211.24s)]
*  better, but all it did was what it drove it underground. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3215.04s)]
*  And then now you had the rise of Al Capone and all the gangsters and they went from [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3219.04s)]
*  their ethnic neighborhoods into taking over entire cities because now they had [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3223.04s)]
*  this great revenue source. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3226.8799999999997s)]
*  And because it was a black market there, you couldn't, you know, just be [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3228.56s)]
*  involved in a legal trade. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3232.9599999999996s)]
*  You couldn't just have like, Oh, here's my warehouse where I keep all of my [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3234.68s)]
*  alcohol. You had to like make it in a bathtub. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3238.44s)]
*  And then what happens when something's in a black market? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3241.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, number one, people end up dying from alcohol poisoning and stuff like that [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3243.84s)]
*  because it's an underground market and it's not being like verified and they're [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3248.32s)]
*  not out in the sunlight. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3251.7200000000003s)]
*  And then the other thing is it brings in this criminal element because, well, if [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3253.1600000000003s)]
*  you got a lot of money's worth of alcohol, but it's illegal, you don't have [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3257.92s)]
*  government protection anymore. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3263.08s)]
*  If somebody robs it from you, you can't call the cops, right? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3264.76s)]
*  Like if you have a bunch of heroin and someone steals it from you, you can't [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3267.24s)]
*  call the cops and report it. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3270.68s)]
*  So you got to have a gun and you got to be ready to go to war with that other [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3272.6s)]
*  gang because you got to protect it yourself. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3276.04s)]
*  Like it was like for all the exact same reasons why prohibition was such a [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3278.16s)]
*  disaster. And by the way, you can look at it where I believe it's still to this [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3283.0s)]
*  day was the highest homicide rate in American history was under prohibition. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3286.8799999999997s)]
*  And then when prohibition ended, it immediately started drastically declining [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3291.64s)]
*  because for obvious reasons. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3295.92s)]
*  And that's the other thing that you get with this war on drugs insanity is it's [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3298.2799999999997s)]
*  such a huge part of the gang culture that is responsible for so much of the [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3302.12s)]
*  violence in this country. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3308.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, whenever there's like a shooting or something like that, the topic of gun [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3309.92s)]
*  control always comes up. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3316.8399999999997s)]
*  But if you actually look and you know, they'll when people who are advocating for [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3318.64s)]
*  gun control, they'll often cite the number of like firearm deaths in America [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3323.96s)]
*  and then compare it to other countries. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3330.7200000000003s)]
*  And they'll be like, look, there's like 30 plus thousand people a year die from [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3332.48s)]
*  guns in America. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3336.6s)]
*  Like, why don't we have a prohibition on the guns? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3338.04s)]
*  Because that's the way people think, you know, more prohibition. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3341.32s)]
*  That'll solve the problem. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3344.48s)]
*  Now, forget all the flaws in that argument. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3346.44s)]
*  You know, like two thirds of those deaths are from suicides and gun control doesn't [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3348.96s)]
*  really seem to affect the suicide rate very much and many of that. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3352.6s)]
*  But the the bulk of the gun violence. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3355.6s)]
*  Comes from the gangs like that's where it comes, I think something like 70 or 80 [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3360.96s)]
*  percent of it comes from the gang culture. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3366.08s)]
*  And yet nobody ever looks at that and goes, oh, you know, the answer to this is to end [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3369.24s)]
*  the war on drugs, to totally undercut the gang source of revenue. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3373.64s)]
*  But that's what worked with the Al Capone gangsters. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3377.72s)]
*  That's what put them out of business. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3380.52s)]
*  And then, by the way, once they were put out of business, when the prohibition of [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3382.6s)]
*  alcohol was when that was repealed, you know where they went, they went into [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3386.72s)]
*  prostitution and gambling, the other prohibitions, they went into the other areas [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3392.64s)]
*  where there's prohibited consenting, you know, like activities with no victims. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3398.6s)]
*  The other nonviolent, victimless criminal area, which were things like gambling and [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3408.32s)]
*  prostitution. And then so you can argue, you know, as people often do, they argue [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3413.6800000000003s)]
*  against these things from like a moral perspective. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3420.88s)]
*  So you go first up, you go like, hey, drugs are immoral. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3423.6800000000003s)]
*  Drugs ruin people's lives, you know, and things like this. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3426.6800000000003s)]
*  We shouldn't have them. They should be illegal. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3430.84s)]
*  But they never want to contend with the other two more important dynamics, which is [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3432.96s)]
*  one. Well, how about the morality of throwing somebody in a cage for that? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3437.88s)]
*  I mean, like like lying is wrong. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3441.68s)]
*  In most cases, generally speaking, you shouldn't lie. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3446.2799999999997s)]
*  But if someone told the lie and then I came up and I hit him in the side of the head [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3450.6s)]
*  with a baseball bat, the conversation wouldn't be like, do you think lying is [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3453.92s)]
*  wrong or not? The conversation would be like, do you think hitting people in the [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3458.36s)]
*  head with a baseball bat is wrong or not? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3461.8799999999997s)]
*  So forget the conversation being like whether drugs are good or not. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3464.3199999999997s)]
*  The conversation is like, how evil is it to throw a human being in a cage to be [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3467.4399999999996s)]
*  raped and tortured over drugs? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3471.8399999999997s)]
*  And then the other conversation would be about like what effect these prohibitions [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3474.2799999999997s)]
*  have. What effect does that have? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3478.08s)]
*  Does it make the problem better or worse? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3480.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think that's something that like. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3483.04s)]
*  Is worth paying attention to, and it's you know, it's something that libertarians [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3487.04s)]
*  have been talking about for many, many decades and has largely been ignored by [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3491.44s)]
*  the left and the right. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3496.2000000000003s)]
*  But I don't think it should be. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3499.08s)]
*  And in the same sense, like I know, I know, I understand where to a lot of [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3500.6s)]
*  right wingers this comes off as like blasphemy, like this just comes off as [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3503.92s)]
*  like, oh, you're for legalizing degeneracy or something like that. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3508.44s)]
*  But I would say to those same right wingers, you know, 20 years ago, you guys [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3513.56s)]
*  weren't all in on the Patriot Act and the war on terrorism and all the, you know, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3517.28s)]
*  the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and all these other things [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3521.04s)]
*  that libertarians warned you against going all in on. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3524.04s)]
*  And now looking back at that, you know, we were completely right about that stuff. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3527.48s)]
*  And in fact, that the the war on terrorism in the Department of Homeland [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3531.84s)]
*  Security is number one enemy over the last few years has been Donald Trump [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3536.0s)]
*  supporting right wingers. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3539.88s)]
*  And. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3541.72s)]
*  It's just something it's something that I think is important to think about, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3543.72s)]
*  especially when you look at a case like this and think about what Donald Trump [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3546.8s)]
*  said, who really is the scumbag here? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3550.96s)]
*  Ross Ulbricht for building a website or the prosecutors who gave them two life [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3553.36s)]
*  sentences plus 40 years. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3557.76s)]
*  You look me in the eye and you tell me who's the bad guy in that story. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3560.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3566.32s)]
*  Um, let's see if there was one, I think there was like one or two other points [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3566.92s)]
*  that I wanted to make, but you know, sometimes when it's just me and I'm just [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looj8P98XLY&t=3571.12s)]
