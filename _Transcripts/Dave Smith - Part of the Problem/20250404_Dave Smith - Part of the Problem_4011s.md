# Dave Smith | Trump's Tariffs | Part Of The Problem 1249
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM)
*  What's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. I am Dave Smith. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=0.0s)]
*  I am Roland Solo for this episode and I will start by saying I apologize. I know our schedule's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=11.6s)]
*  been messed up. I do try my best as many of you may have seen. I was just in Austin, Texas [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=18.28s)]
*  just did another episode of the Joe Rogan Experience. So once again, thank you very [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=25.36s)]
*  much to Joe Rogan who has obviously been the biggest booster of mine by far. It was a great [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=29.74s)]
*  time. I thought it was a really great episode. I always have a great time hanging out there [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=38.76s)]
*  and there in Austin. And this one I thought it was really great and I've gotten an unbelievable [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=42.8s)]
*  response from it. So thank you to everybody for that. I really still do appreciate that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=51.279999999999994s)]
*  very much. I had a good time down. As I mentioned on the show, I got to have a dinner with Scott [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Horton and Darrell Cooper the night before I did the episode, which was a great time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=62.08s)]
*  So it was great to see my bros down there. Great to hang out at the mothership and see [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Rogan and all of that. Yeah. So anyway, great time. And I've got a lot more traveling coming [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=70.58s)]
*  up. I will do my best to keep to the schedule, but just bear with me. The next week is going [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=76.8s)]
*  to be another busy one, but you guys will be happy with the reason why. Okay. So in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=81.24s)]
*  between that, I do have a show down in Nashville at the Zanies in Nashville, which is one of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  my favorite comedy clubs in the world. If you guys, if you're in the Nashville area, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=96.28s)]
*  forget my show. If you haven't been to Zanies, go by there. It's one of the best comedy clubs [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  out there. April 6th. I believe there are still some tickets available, but this show [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=104.44s)]
*  is going to sell out. So make sure you grab those tickets now if you want to come by and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=110.28s)]
*  see me on Sunday night. April 6th. Right. Yep. I think yes. Sunday night. Okay. So one [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=116.4s)]
*  more thing that I wanted to mention before we get into the show. Okay. No, let's jump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=125.72s)]
*  Okay. So the, the only criticism that I saw, and I haven't, I, you know, I haven't seen [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=130.28s)]
*  everything. I'm sure there's other criticism out there, but one of the things that I saw [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=136.72s)]
*  that people were upset that me and Rogan didn't talk about on this last podcast was these, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=139.96s)]
*  the Trump tariffs. And, you know, I would have loved to get into them. But you know, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=146.8s)]
*  it's the Joe Rogan experience. And I, we ended up talking a bunch about, you know, war stuff, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=153.28s)]
*  which has, I guess, become, you know, what I kind of specialize in and what I talk about [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=159.24s)]
*  the most. And I, there's good reason for that. I think that we are actually right now closer [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=164.44s)]
*  to a war with Iran than we've probably been since the end of the Bush administration. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=169.68s)]
*  And that's really, really bad. And I'd like to avoid that. And I mean, it's like, it's, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=175.32s)]
*  it will be such a catastrophe that it's hard to overstate. It will be worse than any of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=181.38s)]
*  the terror wars so far. And it, given the X factor of what Russia might do, what China [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=187.04s)]
*  might do, just a truly, a wildly reckless and dangerous idea. So I did think that was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=194.64s)]
*  important to talk about. However, I want to spend the episode today talking about the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=204.2s)]
*  tariff stuff and kind of in what I'm going to do, which is a little bit different on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=207.88s)]
*  this episode. It's kind of a throwback to what I used to do a lot. But I want to almost [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=214.28s)]
*  talk about this because I don't see enough people on big shows doing this. I want to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=218.68s)]
*  kind of talk about the very basics of economics, of trade, and of tariffs, and then kind of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=224.36s)]
*  get into Trump's specific proposal. And while war and peace might kind of be the thing that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=231.44s)]
*  I am, I'm most known for talking about at this point. Economics is something I've always been [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=238.4s)]
*  very fascinated and interested in. And is also a big part of the reason why I care so much [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=245.32s)]
*  about the warfare machine, because it is, you know, that's a big component of it. That's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=250.12s)]
*  something like $8 trillion we've spent over the last 20 years on foreign wars. And that is a, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  when it comes to economics, that's also the biggest issue. So anyway, let's start this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me try to take it back to almost like square one. So from the very beginning, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=271.47999999999996s)]
*  and I think there are, I know this might sound like a little bit oversimplified or like even [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=275.64s)]
*  child's like it's made for like a fifth grader or something. But I do think it's important to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  just kind of go over some of this stuff. So because it's important to kind of have this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=286.44s)]
*  basic framework in mind, to even know about how to think about these things. And to me, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=291.56s)]
*  to me, in my very amateur understanding of economics, I do think almost the most important [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=298.84s)]
*  thing, like if you had an economics professor, you were in a college class, the most important [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=305.32s)]
*  thing for that professor to do is to get you into the mentality of like how to think about economics. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=310.6s)]
*  There's Bob Murphy, who by the way, I should say, my economic views are influenced primarily by [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=318.92s)]
*  the Missessian School of Economics, Austrian economics. And I highly recommend people read [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  like what about me says and Murray Rothbard, as I was just about to mention, Bob Murphy, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=337.24s)]
*  if you're, if you're looking for someone who's alive, you can't, you can't go wrong with Bob [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=342.6s)]
*  Murphy or Jean Epstein, who I'm almost certain I will get an email from after this episode, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=346.44s)]
*  explaining something that I got wrong, but I'll try my best for Jean here. I'll try my best to be [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=352.36s)]
*  on point with this, by the way, I should also say that Bob Murphy and Jean Epstein have both really [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=357.24s)]
*  been, they've been kind of mentors to me over the last, you know, 15 years or so, 20 years, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=364.36s)]
*  whatever it's been. And they're both really just phenomenal economists. I am not, I'm just a comedian [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=370.76s)]
*  who's read some books about this stuff and likes talking about it. So forgive my lack of expertise, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=378.44s)]
*  but those guys both are legit and just great on this subject. And anyway, so one of the things [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=383.24s)]
*  that I heard Bob Murphy say once in a lecture many years ago was talking about this idea of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=389.0s)]
*  how to think about economics and that if you were to, so the example he gave was like geometry, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=397.16s)]
*  if you were teaching geometry, something I was never very good at and I don't have an [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=404.84s)]
*  interest in and don't know a lot about, but I do remember like a few things like A squared plus B [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=407.88s)]
*  squared equals C squared or something like that. Like this is how you measure the angles on a [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=413.4s)]
*  triangle. And if a student of yours, like if you were, if you taught them A squared plus B squared [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=418.2s)]
*  equals C squared and they went, okay, great, I'm going to go out and find a bunch of triangles to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=424.12s)]
*  measure whether A squared plus B squared equals C squared or not, you'd be like, okay, no, I think [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=430.12s)]
*  you're missing it. You're not exactly understanding it. You don't actually have to go out and test [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=435.88s)]
*  this. This is something you can think about logically. And then you know, it's going to apply [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=439.4s)]
*  to every single triangle in the same sense. When it comes to economics, there's almost like [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=443.8s)]
*  the correct way to be thinking about this stuff. So, okay, taken to its very core, what economics [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=449.64s)]
*  is, is I would say like, essentially, I'm not saying this is like a literal definition, but [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=457.48s)]
*  what economics is, is the study of human action with regard to improving life when scarcity is [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=464.12s)]
*  involved. And that's essentially what economics is. It's like it's human beings acting for a desired [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=476.04s)]
*  end, for an outcome that they wish to pursue when there is scarcity involved. Now, the scarcity [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  component is important, because if you don't have that, it's really outside of the realm of economics. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=493.08s)]
*  The example I like to use is like oxygen. And as oxygen is just not an economic good, because [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=498.84s)]
*  there's no scarcity in it. And I mean, maybe technically speaking, there might be a limit to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=505.96s)]
*  the amount of oxygen that's available on earth. But in effect, in practical uses, it's we all have [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  plenty of it, and we just don't need it. And so it's just not an economic good. It's not anything [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=517.4s)]
*  you have to worry about. Now, if there was scarcity, like real scarcity in oxygen, if it [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=520.76s)]
*  required production to produce oxygen, it would become an economic good very, very quickly, and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=525.48s)]
*  one that we were all very concerned about. There's, you know, the in the same way that food is something [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  we need to survive. And so it's very, it's an important economic good. Oxygen is something we [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=537.24s)]
*  need a lot more, you can go a lot longer without eating than you can without breathing. And so that [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=542.52s)]
*  would but it's not there's no scarcity involved. And so it's kind of outside the realm of economics, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=546.2s)]
*  you don't need policy about it, you don't need to trade to get it, you don't need to turn natural [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=551.0s)]
*  goods into economic goods, it's just there in abundance for us. And this would also be true. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=557.0s)]
*  If goods in general weren't scarce, like if there just was all the goods we could possibly need, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=563.48s)]
*  if you could snap your fingers and have a hamburger in front of you, well, then it wouldn't be an [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=569.48s)]
*  economic good anymore, there would be no need to have a hamburger store or anything, there wouldn't [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=573.08s)]
*  be a price that's charged for it, you wouldn't need trade. Now, the base, the most basic scarcity [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=578.12s)]
*  that almost always exists in in economics is time and energy. And you know, I'm going to say energy, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=586.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, like human and like the energy that you have in a day, like there's only 24 hours in a day, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=598.84s)]
*  you're going to need to be sleeping for at least several of those hours in order to function. And [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  there's only so much you can do. There's only so much you can do before you work yourself to the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=608.76s)]
*  point of exhaustion, and you're limited in time. So like today, if I have, you know, let's just say, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  I have 12 hours of work that I have to do today. And then maybe I need an hour to unwind. And then [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=620.84s)]
*  the rest of the time, I'm going to be sleeping or something like that, or whatever the exact [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=625.8s)]
*  equation is, maybe that's a little too much sleep. But I can do I could do 12 hours of work, then if [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  that's what I have the energy and time to do in a day, but I have to pick what I'm going to work at. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=636.52s)]
*  I can't keep running this experiment over and over again, and doing different things, like I get one, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=641.4s)]
*  one opportunity today to work for it. So let's say you take the most basic economic model. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=646.76s)]
*  It's just you. Like, let's say it's it's you and, and you have a plot of land or something like that. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=655.4s)]
*  And so you want to, you want to build a house, I think of this in the most primitive sense, you're [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=663.3199999999999s)]
*  going to cut down trees to build a log cabin. Okay, that is an economic activity. That is, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=669.64s)]
*  you're transforming natural goods into an economic good. So you're you're cutting down trees that just [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=676.28s)]
*  naturally grow and are just there. And it's what man is born into, like a world with nature and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=683.88s)]
*  trees. And you're going to chop these trees down, you're going to build a log cabin, as many people [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=690.36s)]
*  used to do, crazy as it sounds. So what you're going to do now is you're going to essentially [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=696.6s)]
*  invest your labor into transforming this natural good into a house. Now, the trees served you, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=705.0s)]
*  you know, no real purpose before. I mean, maybe you could pick fruit from them or whatever, but [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=713.88s)]
*  the the trees themselves were just there. And now you have a house that provides you and your family [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=718.52s)]
*  shelter. Okay, so you are you you went into you worked for a desired outcome that you achieved [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=723.08s)]
*  by your work. So now you have, you know, whatever when animals can't get to you, you're a little bit [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=735.1600000000001s)]
*  warmer, when it rains, you don't get as wet. Okay, so that is like, basically, that's the almost the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=741.0s)]
*  start of an economy, you could say, picking fruit is an economic activity, building a chair or a [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=746.84s)]
*  table raising animals, like all of this stuff is like now you're you're working in order to achieve [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=754.9200000000001s)]
*  a desired outcome with scarcity in the mix. So the next step, right, like the next most basic step [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=761.4s)]
*  in economics after this kind of low level you turning natural goods into economic goods is trade. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=771.88s)]
*  And trade explodes economic possibilities. And so by the way, I should just like aside for a second, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=779.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm not in any way if you're like getting ahead of me and going, yeah, but this gets much more [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=787.48s)]
*  complicated. Once governments and nations and all these things come in to play. I'm not arguing with [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=793.5600000000001s)]
*  that. That is the case. I'm just saying this is still the underlying basics of it. And it's worth [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=799.08s)]
*  understanding. So yes, it gets much more complicated when you have a government and there's a foreign [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=803.64s)]
*  nation and they have a government, there's more components to it. But just to understand the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=808.44s)]
*  basics, so we kind of know what we're talking about when we're talking about the more complicated [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=813.48s)]
*  shit. Trade is like a multiplier effect because if you we're all number one, we're all limited by the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=817.24s)]
*  scarcity of time and energy. We're also limited by the scarcity of our own abilities. And different [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=828.84s)]
*  people have different abilities and different people have chose to do different things with [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=834.36s)]
*  their scarce time. And so as we all as we all kind of note on some level, right. So let's just say [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=838.6800000000001s)]
*  you are now you know, you are you built yourself a log cabin and you're you built you were very [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=847.0s)]
*  good at that. You know, you built yourself a good log cabin. And then there's another guy who doesn't [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=854.92s)]
*  know how to build log cabins, but he is really good at raising cattle, whatever. And so he's got food [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=860.92s)]
*  and you know how to build a house. Now you are in desperate need of food and he is in desperate [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=872.68s)]
*  need of shelter. When you guys trade, what you're able to do is saying rather than you having to [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=880.12s)]
*  learn a whole new skill of cattle raising and him having to learn a whole new skill of building a [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=888.36s)]
*  house, you go, okay, here, let's make a trade. I'll build you a house. I'll do the thing I know I'm [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  really good at. If you, you know, feed me and my family for a year, you make a voluntary trade, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=901.16s)]
*  where you both benefit from the expertise of the other person. And you both get something out of [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=908.92s)]
*  it. Now it's important to keep in mind that if the trade is voluntary, right, like if, if you're not [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=915.48s)]
*  being forced to make this deal, but you're voluntarily making the deal, then by definition, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=922.52s)]
*  at least your expectation is that this is beneficial for you. So it's not as if the guy, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=929.88s)]
*  the cattle raiser and the, it's not as if there's a loser in this deal. The expectation from both [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  people is that they'll both be better off. And if you could think, as you kind of scale this up [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=946.12s)]
*  and get closer and closer to what's like a full economy, you could understand like, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=952.6s)]
*  how, how much, how profound that impact of trade is. And that in fact, it is impossible [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=959.3199999999999s)]
*  to have anything even approaching what we might consider prosperity without that. There's no, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=969.7199999999999s)]
*  there's no conceivable way to actually prosper without a lot of different people's expertise [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=978.12s)]
*  and knowledge and their own unique situations, all kind of being fused together [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=987.24s)]
*  in this voluntary exchange. You know, as I sit here in my studio and just look around, I mean, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=994.6s)]
*  it's like unbelievable the amount of knowledge that is all around us. Now the great old example, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1001.64s)]
*  I think Murray Rothbard had one where he did this with a ham sandwich, but the most famous one came [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1010.2s)]
*  from, well, it came from Leonard Reed's I pencil essay, but then I think probably the most famous [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1016.2s)]
*  version of it was Milton Friedman's like thing that he did on the pencil. And this is, it really [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1021.96s)]
*  is like, it's a simple thing. It's kind of something that we all know on some level, but it's really [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1029.24s)]
*  worth thinking about if you want to like attempt to understand economics. And so the pencil thing [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1034.92s)]
*  is basically that he Milton Friedman, I think he made this back in the seventies, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1043.64s)]
*  it might've been the eighties, I think it was the seventies, or he basically holds up a pencil [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1047.0s)]
*  and he's like, okay, this is a pencil. Now let's like go through what is actually takes to be a [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1051.3200000000002s)]
*  pencil because the truth is that there is no human being alive and there's never been a human being [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1057.48s)]
*  that can make a pencil. There's no one person who can do it. Now you might think to yourself, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1063.64s)]
*  I think Tom Wood said this once when he was describing it, he goes, well, you might think [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1070.28s)]
*  to yourself, well, that's not true. You know, my uncle works at the pencil factory and he can make [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1073.3999999999999s)]
*  lots of pencils. But the point is that if you, you know, if, you know, when Milton Friedman's [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1077.56s)]
*  talking about it and he goes, okay, so there's a pencil. Okay. So here's the point, which is, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1085.08s)]
*  you know, a lot of people think it's lead, but it's actually made of graphite graphite is in the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  ground in order to get graphite out of the ground. You need this like machinery in order to have this [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  machinery you need. Like there's, there are so many steps when you actually think about it that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1098.76s)]
*  like you need to figure out how to mine for these things. You need to build the machinery that's [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1104.04s)]
*  going to go into it. You need to build, like there's so much knowledge and this is only, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1108.44s)]
*  we are only dealing with the graphite. We haven't even gotten to like the wood in order to produce [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1112.2s)]
*  the wood in order to produce the little rubber eraser at the end. Okay. You needed this whole [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1116.92s)]
*  process to make rubber. And the more you get into it, the more you realize that there is net, there [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1121.48s)]
*  has never existed a human being who has the knowledge to make a pencil. Like the simplest [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1127.24s)]
*  thing we think of it's like, like all of these different, like, like thousands and thousands of [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1135.48s)]
*  different areas of expertise all have to come together in order to create a pencil. And if you [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1141.8s)]
*  were to just say it like that, you might think to yourself, you'd be like, so what does a pencil go [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1149.16s)]
*  for? Like a million dollars? Like this isn't create, this is a marvel. It's like, it's all these [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1152.6s)]
*  different people's knowledge and work and labor and wisdom all coming together to make this little [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1158.04s)]
*  thing. This must be crazy expensive. And you'd be like, no, it costs like five cents. And if you saw [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1163.8s)]
*  one broken on the street, you wouldn't think twice before you just walked over it. And like, okay, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1169.32s)]
*  that in itself is amazing. You know, and I like, I understand that like, this is something we all take [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1175.32s)]
*  for granted, and we probably should. But when you're really trying to think about these things, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1181.72s)]
*  I think it's worth it to kind of appreciate that it is amazing. These are miracles of, of human [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1185.24s)]
*  creation that we all throughout our day take. And this is just the pencil, by the way. And the reason [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1193.24s)]
*  you use the pencil as the example is because this is the simplest fucking thing. I mean, if you think, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1198.52s)]
*  if you think that's impressive about a pencil, wait until you get into like, you know, a furnace [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1203.48s)]
*  or whatever, you know, like things that are way more complicated, that take way more expertise and [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1208.52s)]
*  way more knowledge. And, you know, Joe Rogan used to have a joke back in the day. That was a great [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1213.24s)]
*  bit on talking monkeys in space. And he was just talking about how we all, we all feel smart because [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1219.4s)]
*  we use smart people stuff, you know, and there's, there's a real illusion that you can create for [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1226.28s)]
*  yourself there. And his joke was just how we use smartphones and computers and we all, but none of [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1232.52s)]
*  us have any idea what, how they work or how to create. And he goes, I think the punchline of the [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1236.76s)]
*  joke was if I left you in the woods with an ax, how long before you could send an email, you know, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1241.4s)]
*  but like, it's a really funny joke, but it's, it's there. It's a very intelligent comment. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1247.08s)]
*  Cause you start to realize just like the answer to that is it's important. You could, I could give you [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1251.32s)]
*  a hundred thousand years with an ax in the woods and how long before you can send an email, the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1255.96s)]
*  answers you'll never get there. It's just impossible for one person to get there. But [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1261.48s)]
*  when you got, you know, millions and millions and millions of people, in this case, billions of [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1267.0s)]
*  people all trading together, these miracles are possible. All right, guys, let's take a moment [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1271.64s)]
*  and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is my Patriot supply. Look, we've seen it before [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1277.72s)]
*  when a crisis hits grocery store shelves are the first to go bare. And we've also seen that that [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1283.24s)]
*  can happen pretty quickly. And that's why I get four week emergency food supplies from my Patriot [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1289.0s)]
*  supply. And right now they're making it easier than ever order their four week emergency food [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1295.4s)]
*  supply today and get four 72 hour food kits completely free. That's almost two weeks of [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1301.24s)]
*  bonus meals at no cost. Each of these kits offers 2000 calories per day of delicious, easy to prepare [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1307.56s)]
*  meals that last up to 25 years. That's real peace of mind. No last minute panic about empty shelves. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1314.52s)]
*  Just know that you're covered stock up today before this deal disappears, because when emergency hits [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1322.04s)]
*  food will be the first thing to go go to my site, prepare with Smith.com to claim your kit plus an [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1328.2s)]
*  extra 12 days of food for free. That's prepare with Smith.com. And this is not again, none of [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1334.6s)]
*  this is an opinion. This is this is a just a description of how the world works. And so when [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1343.0s)]
*  you have this dynamic where through trade, we're a let it's this crazy multiplier effect where we're [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1352.12s)]
*  able to level up and level up and level up and even every person who has crazy expertise in some [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1358.52s)]
*  area that you have no knowledge of, they still only have one of those areas down. And of course, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1363.96s)]
*  as an economy grows more and more and more, what you have is more and more specialization, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1370.76s)]
*  less and less general knowledge, but more and more specialization, because the more people specialize, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1378.2s)]
*  like if they're if they're much better at their very narrow little area, and then they can trade [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1384.52s)]
*  with other people who are really good at very narrow areas. Now, we can all have the benefits [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1389.88s)]
*  of everybody's narrow area of expertise. And we have you just have to look around your house, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1395.8s)]
*  you have you are surrounded right now by thousands of examples of this that are truly amazing. They're [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1400.84s)]
*  they're miracles. And it's like, this is something that we take for granted, it's kind of good in a [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1407.1599999999999s)]
*  way that we take it for granted, because then it allows us to focus on other things, so we can [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1414.12s)]
*  keep leveling up. But this is like a very basically how economies start and grow. And how you know [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1417.96s)]
*  what I'm saying, like how they how they started a very primitive level, and then grow into what is [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1428.28s)]
*  a modern economy. It's from different people having their different levels of expertise, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1435.08s)]
*  and everybody trading with each other. Now, of course, go back to my primitive example, right. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1439.72s)]
*  And this is where like, I think everybody kind of knows this on some level. But this is where [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1445.64s)]
*  currency comes in is like, okay, it's one thing when you're trading, like my example of where [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1450.28s)]
*  you're trading with your neighbor, you know, log cabins for cattle or whatever, and you can make [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1455.32s)]
*  these any example you want. One guy is really good at building chairs, you know, the other guy is [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1459.4s)]
*  really good at fixing roofs or whatever. Now, that works really well. If your neighbor needs a chair, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1464.76s)]
*  and you need your roof fixed, but sometimes, you know, your neighbor needs a chair, and you need [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1473.88s)]
*  something to eat. And he's like, Well, I can't fix it. And then you would have to go find someone [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1479.16s)]
*  who has food and needs a chair. Whereas if you have currency, you don't need to worry about that, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1484.5200000000002s)]
*  because you can just give that person currency, which represents kind of like a unit of your [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1490.7600000000002s)]
*  value. They can take that and go get what they need. So you can build them a chair, get money [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1495.0s)]
*  for it, and then go buy food from someone who has food. So that's another kind of multiplier effect [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1500.28s)]
*  like that lets you that that facilitates trade. So you have this store of value. Now that's the idea [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1504.6s)]
*  of money, you have a store of value, and that you can just you can trade your labor for this value, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1511.0s)]
*  and then trade that value for whatever you want. I guess it should also be, since we're getting into [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1517.08s)]
*  the basics of this talking about trade here, and now that money has come in, right? If you are [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1525.08s)]
*  trading money for goods, you now have what is known today as a trade deficit. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1534.52s)]
*  There's an imbalance in trade, they'll call it sometimes. But again, that's all kind of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1546.04s)]
*  an artificial concept. For example, I have a huge trade deficit with my supermarket. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1554.68s)]
*  I go there, okay fine, my wife goes there. But me as a family, we go there, some member of our [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1566.3600000000001s)]
*  family goes there, and gives them money for food. Every week we're doing this, and they never give [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1573.96s)]
*  us money for anything. They've never bought anything from our family. We always just buy [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1581.88s)]
*  from them. But you could see like in that example, it would be silly to think that because there's a [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1586.5200000000002s)]
*  trade deficit, that somehow they're ripping me off. Like that's just not, it's a voluntary trade. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1592.6000000000001s)]
*  It's just like the two guys trading where it's a win-win relationship. It's the same thing when [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1599.0800000000002s)]
*  you go there. This is by the way why you have that moment. John Stossel used to talk about this all [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1604.6000000000001s)]
*  the time when he says the double thank you moment. But whenever you go to a store and you buy [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1609.0s)]
*  something, and once you get the thing, you give them the money, and you go thank you, and they go [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1614.12s)]
*  thank you, and then you leave. It's just like an interesting little thing. You're both thanking [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1619.4s)]
*  each other. Like typically in life, when you thank someone, the response is you're welcome, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1624.2s)]
*  not thank you. If I'm like, oh, could you pass me a tissue, and you pass me a tissue, I go thank you, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1630.28s)]
*  and you go you're welcome. It's not, you don't thank me back. But with economic transactions, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1637.56s)]
*  we both thank each other. And the obvious reason for that is that my supermarket wants the money [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1644.28s)]
*  more than they want the food. They have an abundance of food, and they're trying to trade [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1651.08s)]
*  it for money. I have money, and I want something to eat. So I'm happy to trade my money for food. We [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1656.28s)]
*  both expect to be better off. Now, I'm not saying this. It's not that 100% of the time you both will [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1662.28s)]
*  be better off, but 100% of the time, you both have the expectation that you'll be better off. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1669.32s)]
*  So that's how trade works. Now, if I were to look at that and say, oh, I'm running up this [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1676.2s)]
*  huge trade deficit with my supermarket because they're not buying anything from me, but I'm [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1681.56s)]
*  buying a lot of stuff from them, you can already see where that just doesn't make any sense. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1686.6s)]
*  That's not a real issue. And there isn't, in fact, a deficit, because I've been trading with [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1692.28s)]
*  them for something that I wanted more than the money. It was a voluntary transaction. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1698.68s)]
*  And so this would not now if you were, let's go through another scenario here, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1703.3999999999999s)]
*  maybe even back to the more primitive economic transaction. Let's say, you know, you've got some [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1708.92s)]
*  chickens and you're trading eggs and your neighbor has some berries and your neighbor's like, you [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1716.28s)]
*  know, you're like, look, me and my family have all the eggs we need. We have all the eggs we can eat [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1722.92s)]
*  and then some, but we'd really love some berries with our eggs. And the neighbor is like, we have [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1726.68s)]
*  all the berries we could eat. Maybe then some, we'd really love some eggs that obviously you could see [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1731.8799999999999s)]
*  you guys could come together and make a win-win trade where you're both better off for making this [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1735.8799999999999s)]
*  trade. Okay. Now let's say your neighbor, he's trading you eggs and you're giving them berries [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1741.24s)]
*  and you were like, Hey, I'll give you whatever the number is. You know, I'll give you 50 berries [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1750.6s)]
*  for 10 eggs. And he goes, he goes, no, you know what? Just, just give me 30. Don't even worry [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1757.56s)]
*  about the 50. Give me 30. Like let's say he, he, he lowers his prices. Okay. Is there any conceivable [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1764.84s)]
*  way where you could say, Oh, he's ripping me off. He's ripping me off by charging less. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1773.24s)]
*  No, right. You'd have to acknowledge that that is he's only helping you by charging less. Like [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1782.36s)]
*  even if you don't want the extra berries, even if you threw them in the trash, you're, it's still [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1788.84s)]
*  the same thing for you. As if he charged you the full thing charging less is not ripping you off. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1793.88s)]
*  And the same way if my supermarket were to say, Hey, we're lowering the price of groceries that [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1800.3600000000001s)]
*  would, there's no conceivable way that you would say like, Oh, this is a dirty game. Your plan [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1805.8000000000002s)]
*  ripping me off here. It's just, that's just not correct. And I always thought this was, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1810.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, it was interesting because there's in so many different ways, the way that like now [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1816.0400000000002s)]
*  moving back toward kind of like real life, which is again, all this stuff is real life, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1820.92s)]
*  but I'm saying just a more sophisticated version of where we find ourselves today in 2025. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1827.0800000000002s)]
*  It's just interesting. And I'm not, obviously there are many other factors. I'll try to get [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1831.88s)]
*  into some of them. It is far more complicated than, than just that simple model, but all of [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  the stuff in that simple model is still true in this more complicated version. So I've heard it, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1841.96s)]
*  and I remember Bob Murphy said this years ago when he was doing a debate on free trade [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1847.64s)]
*  versus protectionism that, you know, there's so much of the way people frame this conversation [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1853.72s)]
*  for years now has been that China is ripping us off because they sell cheap goods. And the way [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1860.6000000000001s)]
*  it's been referred to is a dumping that they dump their cheap goods on us. Now I'm just saying, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1870.2s)]
*  if you could reduce this back to the individual level of trade, you could see how at least the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1877.0s)]
*  starting point here is like, that does sound kind of ridiculous. Like, you know, if back to my [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1880.76s)]
*  simple trade example, if you were like, Hey, I'll trade you 50 berries for 10 eggs. And they go, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1886.2s)]
*  he goes, dude, let me tell you something. Give me 10 berries. I'll give you all the eggs you want. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1891.48s)]
*  You can just take as many. And you're like, Oh, in that case, I'll take a bunch. Like I'll take, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1895.96s)]
*  I'll take a hundred eggs. And he goes, no problem. Here's your hundred eggs. Could you then turn [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1900.2s)]
*  around and say, Hey, you know, this neighbor guy of mine is dumping cheap eggs on me. You'd be like, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1905.08s)]
*  wait, what? You voluntarily made this deal. You asked for this much. Okay. That is what's going [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1911.96s)]
*  on with our trade with China. This is not, this is not that China is coming in from the sky and [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1917.6399999999999s)]
*  dumping cheap Chinese goods on us. These are American businesses purchasing goods from China. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1924.04s)]
*  The, that is not now the way Bob Murphy said it in that debate was he goes, if you think, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1930.76s)]
*  if you think selling us cheap goods is ripping us off and that that's making us poorer. If your [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1937.56s)]
*  argument is that another country selling us cheap goods is making us poorer, then by that logic, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1945.32s)]
*  you'd have to argue that if they really wanted to screw us over, they would give us stuff for free. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1951.0s)]
*  But now think about what you're reduced to arguing. You're arguing that someone giving [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1956.84s)]
*  you something for free makes you poorer. Now that, that is quite a pretzel to tie yourself into. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1962.52s)]
*  Now I've mentioned this before and what people come back at me with is they'll be like, Oh, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1970.4399999999998s)]
*  but Dave, you know, welfare keeps people in poverty. So isn't that an example of giving [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1974.76s)]
*  someone something for free and that actually makes them poorer? And no, that's not the case. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1980.12s)]
*  That is not a correct understanding of why well, listen, welfare is a government program. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1986.6s)]
*  And so there's a few, there's a few important differences here. So welfare, number one, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1993.32s)]
*  governments don't have anything, so they can't give anything. All governments can do is tax one [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=1999.7199999999998s)]
*  group of people and then give it out to another group of people. I mean, technically speaking, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2005.8s)]
*  they can also borrow the money, which is just a promise to tax you in the future, or they could [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2010.04s)]
*  print the money, which is in effect just a tax in the present, taking the value of your money and [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2015.24s)]
*  giving it to someone else. But it doesn't matter. No matter what, in any of those three options, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2020.28s)]
*  all governments doing is taking from one group of its domestic population and giving it to another [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2025.48s)]
*  group. So first of all, the welfare benefit isn't just giving someone something free, it's taking [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2031.0s)]
*  that much from someone else and then giving it to them for free. And if you really want to get [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2038.1200000000001s)]
*  technical about it, it's taking a larger amount, paying a bunch of bureaucrats and government [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2042.92s)]
*  employees and politicians along the way, and then giving what's left to somebody else. So that's a [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2049.16s)]
*  difference between just giving someone something for free and welfare. But the other thing, the [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2054.6s)]
*  more major thing is that the way that welfare keeps people poor is that there'll be a system where it [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2058.6s)]
*  says, okay, it says, if you're out of work, you get a check. But then you lose that check. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2063.64s)]
*  If you start working, so welfare is subsidizing you to not be productive. Okay, so you're [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2073.16s)]
*  subsidizing a bad thing. A very basic law of economics is that if you subsidize something, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2081.8s)]
*  you get more of it than you otherwise would. And if you tax something, you get less of it [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2088.04s)]
*  than you otherwise would. So with welfare, you're subsidizing a bad thing. Now, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2092.84s)]
*  the other hand of that is when you're taxing something, and look, by the way, everyone knows [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2100.7599999999998s)]
*  this is true in economics, including liberals. This is why they support taxes on cigarettes [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2105.7999999999997s)]
*  and subsidizing green energy. It's because they want less cigarette smoking and more green energy, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2112.44s)]
*  which makes it like that is a policy to get less of that and more of that. And as people may know, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2119.56s)]
*  I mean, I was a kid in a smoker when the taxes really started going into effect, and it drastically [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2126.12s)]
*  got less people smoking in this country. You make something more expensive, less people are going to [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2133.56s)]
*  buy it. And of course, there's a lot more green energy than there would be without the subsidies. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2138.04s)]
*  This is very basic economics. And so now, what we have with welfare, where the money is collected [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2142.44s)]
*  from taxes, you're going to tax working, you're going to tax a good thing, so you get less of it, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2151.24s)]
*  and you're going to subsidize not working, so you get more of that. So that's what keeps people [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2159.9599999999996s)]
*  poor, not the fact that they got free stuff, the fact that you're subsidizing a bad behavior and [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2165.56s)]
*  taxing a good behavior. Now, by the way, the income tax is a tax on working. Think about it, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2171.24s)]
*  by the way, just like in anything, it's a punishment. Think about how insane that is. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2177.88s)]
*  It's a fee, a fine. This is what we do with low level crimes. Speeding, you get a fee, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2185.2400000000002s)]
*  that you get a ticket, your punishment is a fine. We do that with working. That's what the income [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2194.04s)]
*  tax is. It's a punishment. We have criminalized working, and the punishment is a fine. Now, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2202.28s)]
*  what tariffs are is a tax on trade. Now, the issue you have here is that trade, it's not just a good [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2211.32s)]
*  thing. It's the most wonderful thing that's ever happened in the history of the world. Now, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2220.1200000000003s)]
*  you could argue which one of those is preferable, and I probably would say a tax on trade is better [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2225.0800000000004s)]
*  than a tax on working, but they're both very related as we just went over. This is the [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2229.88s)]
*  basics of economics. This is how prosperity happens through work and through trade. And so to tax [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2237.4s)]
*  either of those, suggesting you want less of them is just terrible economics, just terrible. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2243.7200000000003s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Native [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2250.04s)]

*  And okay, so anyway, back to my point before how you would have to in order to argue that, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2321.8s)]
*  that, that giving, right, in order to argue that undercutting, that charging less is making people [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2329.88s)]
*  poorer, then you'd have to argue, as Bob Murphy points out, that giving them something for free [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2339.0s)]
*  would be even worse than that by the same logic, right? But if you're going to argue that, if you're [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2344.04s)]
*  going to argue that giving something, someone for free is making them poorer, you know, you're dumping [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2349.64s)]
*  your goods on them by giving them something free upon request, then you would have to think to [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2355.88s)]
*  yourself that we'd be better off if oxygen was scarce, because essentially, in effect, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2362.44s)]
*  we all get oxygen for free every day. It's the most vital thing that we need, much more vital [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2372.84s)]
*  than food and water, in the sense that you could survive much longer without water or without food [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2380.84s)]
*  than you could without oxygen. It's the most, and it's just in abundance and free for us. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2386.84s)]
*  Now, in a sense, God is dumping not even cheap oxygen on us, he's dumping free oxygen on us, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2392.52s)]
*  undercutting our own American production of oxygen, right? Like, let's just say, okay, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2402.44s)]
*  there's a way to produce oxygen, but we don't even have to worry about that, because God has given it [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2408.44s)]
*  to all of us for free. Would you argue that God is undercutting us, God is making us all poorer, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2413.2400000000002s)]
*  and that if we took that away, and then we had to produce oxygen here in America, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2419.96s)]
*  that we'd be better off? Because think about that, right? It is true that, let's just say, there were [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2427.0s)]
*  production where you could produce oxygen, and you had to build these great big factories in order to [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2434.2s)]
*  produce oxygen. It is true, in a sense, that all those factories are put out of business by the fact [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2439.32s)]
*  that oxygen is plentiful, and we don't need to worry about producing it, no one's going to buy it, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2445.8s)]
*  because we all already have it. But wouldn't you think, right, and this is what I mean at the very [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2449.96s)]
*  beginning about how to think about economics, wouldn't you recognize that, look, you've got this [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2454.44s)]
*  all backward if you were looking at this and saying, oh, look, God just put all of these [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2459.8s)]
*  American oxygen factories out of business. You'd be like, no, no, no, no, you're just not thinking [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2465.2400000000002s)]
*  about economics the right way. You've got this totally wrong, because yes, it's true that if [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2470.04s)]
*  oxygen was taken away, we would have to build up all these big factories, and then people would be [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2475.0800000000004s)]
*  lining up to go buy oxygen from them, and they could probably charge just about whatever they [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2479.8s)]
*  wanted for a day's oxygen, because that'd be very important to you. But if you were thinking about [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2483.8s)]
*  economics the right way, you'd be like, no, no, no, no, that's not better. That's not better, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2488.2s)]
*  because then all of these people would have to take all of this energy and go put it toward [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2492.9199999999996s)]
*  producing something, and then we'd all have to take all of this money and put it toward buying [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2499.8799999999997s)]
*  something that we don't even have to worry about right now. And now we could just take that money [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2503.72s)]
*  and spend it on something else, because we've already got that covered. And the people who [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2507.7999999999997s)]
*  are producing don't have to work in these factories, because we don't even need them to. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2513.16s)]
*  They can go produce something else now. And so it's just making us richer that we have this [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2518.12s)]
*  for free. There's lots of good examples of this. Frederick Bastiat wrote, I think his example was [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2523.64s)]
*  that he was making an argument that we should eliminate the sun, because they're putting the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2529.64s)]
*  candle makers out of business or something like that. But if you're thinking about economics in [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2535.72s)]
*  the correct way, I think you'd recognize that someone charging you less, or someone giving you [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2540.6s)]
*  something for free is not inherently them ripping you off. And it makes no sense to think about [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2546.12s)]
*  things like that. Okay. As I mentioned before, things do get more complicated when you're talking [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2552.2s)]
*  about one group of people with a government and another group of people with another government. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2562.36s)]
*  Now, part of the reason why that is, is because you could have a situation where we find ourselves [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2567.72s)]
*  where we are today. And so I've said this from the very beginning, okay? But I wanted to kind [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2576.68s)]
*  of lay out that groundwork. But this is why I've had this opinion on Donald Trump's tariffs that [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2581.08s)]
*  I have for a while. It is true that right now in our current situation, you have other countries [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2586.52s)]
*  who put tariffs on US goods, meaning they tax their domestic population for trading [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2595.8s)]
*  with the United States of America. Now, this is bad for the same reasons that it's taxing goods [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2603.5600000000004s)]
*  are when I say goods, positive things, taxing positive things like labor or trade is inherently [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2610.6000000000004s)]
*  destructive. Okay, so that is true. It's bad that we do that. And one of the things that truly is [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2616.6000000000004s)]
*  appalling from my perspective, at least, is that you have many countries who the US subsidizes. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2624.2s)]
*  The US subsidizes these countries, and then they turn around and they put tariffs on our goods. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2633.96s)]
*  European countries where we essentially pay for their defense, we give them Article 5 guaranteed [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2642.04s)]
*  protection under NATO, which let's get real. Article 5 says that if one NATO country is attacked, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2648.68s)]
*  all of them have to join the effort to defend that country. But really that's America will join the [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2656.04s)]
*  effort is what the real guarantee is there. It's not like if England was attacked tomorrow, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2661.72s)]
*  they're not like, thank God for NATO, because now Finland has our back. You know what I mean? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2669.56s)]
*  They're saying thank God because the United States of America, the most powerful military in the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2674.6s)]
*  history of the world has their back. So we're guaranteeing protection for all these countries, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2678.44s)]
*  and then they'll turn around and tariff our automobiles, make it harder for Ford or General [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2683.0s)]
*  Motors to compete while their European cars can, it's easier. So that's an outrage. And to the [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2689.16s)]
*  extent that Donald Trump could threaten a tariff against them to get them to bring down their [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2696.76s)]
*  tariffs, like if he could use that as a kind of bullying tool to bring them to the negotiating [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2703.96s)]
*  table to make everybody lower tariffs, then that's a win. And so it's a little bit of an [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2710.04s)]
*  interesting dance. However, that's not what's going on here at all. And the major problem you [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2715.56s)]
*  have is that that's not everything that Donald Trump ever says about tariffs, and so many of [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2722.92s)]
*  the things that Trump supporters say about tariffs, they're speaking about tariffs as if [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2729.24s)]
*  they're a good in and of themselves. And I think the obvious question, this is, it seems to me, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2733.8799999999997s)]
*  like this is MAGA's minimum wage argument here. This is MAGA's 15 bucks an hour. Okay. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2739.0s)]
*  Why is it if tariffs are a good in and of themselves, if it's just, this is the benefit [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2747.7999999999997s)]
*  to American production, and that's how we bring all these jobs back and make our economy stronger, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2754.2s)]
*  why are we, why don't we just have 500% tariffs on every single country? Why does Donald Trump [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2759.4s)]
*  threaten tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and then they send some troops to the border, and then he [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2766.84s)]
*  lowers the tariffs? Why do that? Why not just have, like, explain to me what the limiting principle [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2771.56s)]
*  is here, because if you're just describing tariffs as a good in and of themselves, and they're just [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2778.12s)]
*  inherently beneficial, I'm not understanding why you don't support drastically increased tariffs [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2783.32s)]
*  on everybody. Why are we even messing around with all of this? Because if you're acknowledging that [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2789.4s)]
*  it's a negotiating tool, okay, but what's the outcome that we're trying to negotiate? Now, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2794.6800000000003s)]
*  if you agree with me and you say the outcome we're trying to negotiate is that all tariffs come down, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2799.1600000000003s)]
*  okay, but then tariffs aren't a good in and of themselves, they're just a tool, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2804.6000000000004s)]
*  and a risky one at that to try to get other countries to lower their tariffs. Now, it should [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2808.68s)]
*  also be pointed out, and I'll kind of get more into this in a second here, but it should also [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2814.2s)]
*  be pointed out that if, like, if I'm correct about this, and I'm saying that it is an outrage that [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2819.16s)]
*  there's countries that we're subsidizing that then turn around and put tariffs on our goods, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2827.96s)]
*  one way to deal with that, I suppose, is to threaten them with tariffs in the hope that [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2835.32s)]
*  they'll lower their tariffs. Again, this is a risky game, because you're threatening with something [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2841.1600000000003s)]

*  But the other way to solve that problem would be to stop subsidizing those countries. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2854.2000000000003s)]
*  This way, you're just doing a positive thing, you're just helping your own country, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2860.04s)]
*  and it doesn't come with a threat of punching yourself in the nose. Call our bluff that we're [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2864.1200000000003s)]
*  going to stop subsidizing you. Okay, bluff called, we're not subsidizing you anymore. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2869.1600000000003s)]

*  in reality, what therapy is really about is filling in your blind spots. We all have certain blind [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2900.3599999999997s)]

*  just announced, which I believe is going into effect in a few days here, is the most sweeping [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2952.52s)]
*  tariff policy in, I believe, over 100 years. He's done it through executive order. We will [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2959.8799999999997s)]
*  see what comes as a result of this. Rand Paul has been challenging this in the Senate and saying [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2967.16s)]
*  that the president doesn't have the authority to put these sweeping taxes in. Rand Paul is 100% [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2975.7999999999997s)]
*  correct in his opposition to this. Donald Trump has lost the plot, if you ask me, on this and [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2982.04s)]
*  several other important issues. But let's hear, I want to play Donald Trump. So Donald Trump gave [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2991.24s)]
*  a big speech announcing this. I believe he spoke for an hour and a half or something like that. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=2997.48s)]
*  I couldn't find this clip anywhere else, but I did find it on BreakingPoint, so thank you [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3004.2s)]
*  to Crystal and Sagar for playing this clip. We'll borrow that from you now. But I did want to play [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3008.2s)]
*  this and kind of address what Donald Trump is saying here as he announces these sweeping tariffs. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3013.8799999999997s)]
*  Let's check in with the president. From 1789 to 1913, we were a tariff-backed nation, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3019.48s)]
*  and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been. So wealthy, in fact, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3029.8s)]
*  that in the 1880s, they established a commission to decide what they were going to do with the [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3034.84s)]
*  vast sums of money they were collecting. We were collecting so much money so fast, we didn't know [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3041.64s)]
*  what to do with it. Isn't that a nice problem to have? What do you think, Marco? Good problem? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3046.2s)]
*  Marco would love that problem. But we don't have that problem anymore, but we're not going to have [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3051.3199999999997s)]
*  it very much longer, I will tell you. But they collected so much money, they actually formed a [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3057.56s)]
*  commission to determine what they were going to do with the money, who they were going to give it [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3062.3599999999997s)]
*  to, and how much. Then in 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3066.04s)]
*  that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3073.48s)]
*  our government. But likewise, the old-fashioned term that we use, groceries, I used it in the campaign. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3078.6s)]
*  This is just where, I'm sorry, man, I mean, this is just totally wrong. Or I should say, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3085.16s)]
*  totally wrong, but it's really missing the very key detail here. Okay, so it is true that, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3092.92s)]
*  let's say there were points in America, he's talking about in the 1800s, going into the early [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3099.0800000000004s)]
*  20th century. Yes, it's true that we had tariffs. And then in 1913, the worst president in the [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3106.44s)]
*  history of the union, Woodrow Wilson, introduced the income tax. The following year, he introduced [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3114.6800000000003s)]
*  the central bank. And there is certainly an argument, probably one I'd agree with, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3120.12s)]
*  although I'm a little bit open to having my mind changed on this. But there is an argument that [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3129.7999999999997s)]
*  we're way better off in a situation where we didn't have the income tax and we had tariff policy. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3136.2s)]
*  Certainly way better off with no central bank and no income tax and we had tariffs. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3144.92s)]
*  But this is missing of just a huge part of the picture here. So, as I've mentioned many times [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3149.4s)]
*  on the show before, and it's worth repeating, but so from, say, the end of the Civil War [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3157.7200000000003s)]
*  until 1913, okay, so you're saying 1865 to 1913. It is hard for people to understand [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3163.88s)]
*  how much of an experiment in free market capitalist economics the United States of America was. It was [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3173.7999999999997s)]
*  the greatest experiment in free markets in human history and is also the time period when America [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3180.12s)]
*  became the richest, most powerful country in the world. Donald Trump is right about that. But it's [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3185.72s)]
*  not just like, oh, we had tariffs, therefore tariff policy good. That's not the takeaway from it. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3191.3199999999997s)]
*  In this time period, America had no income tax, no central bank. So we had sound money and no [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3199.1600000000003s)]
*  income taxes. We also had no regulatory state, no welfare state. Federal spending was like 2% [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3209.0s)]
*  of the national income or something like that. I mean, it was the size and scope of the government [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3217.4s)]
*  was tiny, tiny. And yes, in this period, the way the government raised money was having some [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3223.4s)]
*  taxes on trade. Okay. Yes, it is true that that was enormously preferable to what has followed [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3231.7200000000003s)]
*  after it. But Donald Trump is not recreating any of those conditions. I mean, I'm sorry, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3239.4s)]
*  give me a break, but there may have been some talk at Doge about cutting 2 trillion in spending, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3245.88s)]
*  which by the way is nothing in the grand scheme of things you're talking about, maybe bringing [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3250.92s)]
*  the talk of the drastic spending cuts. And by the way, I should look into the specifics of this, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3257.56s)]
*  because I'm not even sure it's this drastic. But if you were to cut $2 trillion out of the federal [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3261.88s)]
*  budget this year, like if you're not planning on doing this over five or 10 or 15 years, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3266.6800000000003s)]
*  if you cut this year, $2 trillion in the budget, you would be bringing the size of the US federal [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3271.4s)]
*  government back to 2019 levels. 2019. That's how far back you'd be winding the clock. Not 1818, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3277.4s)]
*  not 1918, 2019. Okay. So like, this is the idea that Donald Trump has these tariffs going into [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3290.6800000000003s)]
*  effect in three days. We still have an income tax. We still have a federal reserve. We still have [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3302.28s)]
*  the biggest federal government in the history of the world. We're still going to be spending close [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3310.1200000000003s)]
*  to $7 trillion a year. We still have a giant regulatory state. None of the conditions of what [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3313.6400000000003s)]
*  he's talking about, where this tariff policy worked, are coming into effect. And this would [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3319.5600000000004s)]
*  almost be a reasonable claim if Donald Trump was somehow, of course, he can't do this through [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3325.7200000000003s)]
*  executive action, but if somehow he was announcing that we're abolishing income taxes, we're [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3330.52s)]
*  abolishing the federal reserve, we're going back on a gold standard, we're abolishing the welfare [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3335.48s)]
*  state, we're abolishing the regulatory state, but we're going to have these tariffs, then what he's [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3340.68s)]
*  saying right here is a conversation to have. He's saying none of that. None of that. He's saying, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3346.6s)]
*  keep all that stuff we have plus enormous taxes on trade on top of it. I'm sorry, this argument [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3352.92s)]
*  makes no fucking sense. This is just, he's completely wrong about this. All right, let's keep playing. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3361.7200000000003s)]
*  But likewise, an old-fashioned term that we use, groceries, I used it in the [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3373.7200000000003s)]
*  campaign. It's such an old-fashioned term, but a beautiful term, groceries. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3377.8s)]
*  It sort of says a bag with different things in it. Groceries went through the roof. And I campaigned [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3381.72s)]
*  on that. I talked about the word groceries for a lot. And so we're going to be charging a discounted [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3387.8799999999997s)]
*  reciprocal tariff of 34 percent. I think, in other words, they charge us, we charge them, we charge [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3393.3999999999996s)]
*  them less. So how can anybody be upset? They will be because we never charge anybody anything, but now [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3398.68s)]
*  we're going to charge. European Union, they're very tough, very, very tough traders. You know, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3404.44s)]
*  you think of European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It's so sad to see. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3411.96s)]
*  Sagar Hussain It was nearly an hour long. And that chart, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3416.76s)]
*  Josh Birk But I'm sorry, Sagar, I don't mean to cut you off there. They're great, by the way. Go [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3420.2000000000003s)]
*  watch Breaking Points. Love that show. I think I'm going back on there soon. So look, I mean, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3425.7200000000003s)]
*  with the grocery stuff and Donald Trump's just being hilarious, by the way he is, it only comes [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3432.44s)]
*  out sometimes because he's such a like every man billionaire. But every now and then you do remember, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3437.08s)]
*  oh yeah, Donald Trump's like a billionaire. Like I don't even groceries is a pretty common word. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3441.88s)]
*  I'd still use it. I don't know. I didn't think this was like some antiquated thing. Anyway, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3446.6s)]
*  I just also, I love, I'm sorry, this is off the point and I don't have much time left, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3452.92s)]
*  but there is something, there's something about Donald Trump that he does that is the most [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3457.4s)]
*  hilarious and somehow endearing, even though it's so retarded, but it's just the thing where he'll [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3461.24s)]
*  go off teleprompter because like he said a word and then he feels like he needs a little, you know, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3468.12s)]
*  like he got like he says groceries, groceries, big bag and different things. Like, you know, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3474.12s)]
*  that wasn't on the teleprompter, but whatever. Anyway, this is, it should also be pointed out [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3479.9599999999996s)]
*  because people have real have like, because he just announced this crazy high tariffs on all these [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3486.4399999999996s)]
*  different countries at all these different rates and he's calling them reciprocal taxes, but they're [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3490.84s)]
*  reciprocal tariffs, but they're not. These aren't reciprocal. They based it. The formula has been [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3494.92s)]
*  cracked. Now they based it just on trade deficit. So if we have a big trade deficit with you, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3500.36s)]
*  that's how they judge whether we're going to implement tariffs on you. And that again, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3505.88s)]
*  like I said before, this is goofy. This is like, there's just no debate here. This is goofy, goofy [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3510.04s)]
*  economics. If you want to make the argument for reciprocal tariffs, then the only sound [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3515.4s)]
*  economic argument you could make for that would be that again, they're charging us 15% [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3521.7200000000003s)]
*  on our cars and that's making our auto manufacturers hurt. That's making them hurt. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3528.76s)]
*  So we're going to charge that and make their auto companies hurt, even though it's going to make our [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3534.92s)]
*  consumers hurt too in an attempt to bring all of these down to get them to go. Okay, fine. We'll [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3539.72s)]
*  stop charging you tariffs and then everybody is better off when there's none. All right guys, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3545.8799999999997s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is sheath underwear guys. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3550.4399999999996s)]
*  I've been telling you about sheath underwear for years now. It is the best pair of boxer briefs [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3556.2s)]
*  you will ever own. The only pair of underwear that I ever wear. I will tell you, this is a true story. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3561.24s)]
*  So as you guys may know, I'm stupid. I might come off as smart in this show, but generally speaking, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3567.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm very, very stupid. So I was traveling recently and I forgot to pack underwear. I just got to [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3573.2400000000002s)]
*  where I was and I was like, oh my God, I didn't pack any underwear. So I had to run to the store [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3580.68s)]
*  and buy like a six pack of like whatever crappy brand underwear. And I have not, it was the first [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3585.0s)]
*  time in years that I've worn anything other than sheath. And it reminded me immediately why I love [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3591.24s)]
*  sheath underwear so much. My whole day was just terrible. You don't realize how bad it is. Life [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3596.8399999999997s)]
*  is so much better when you put on a nice pair of quality boxer briefs. You just feel your best. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3602.3599999999997s)]

*  Okay, fine. It should also be pointed out that Donald Trump did flirt with this idea. It was [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3638.76s)]
*  back in his first term. It was at the G20 or at the G6, G7, whatever. I'm sorry, I can't keep up [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3643.88s)]
*  with all this stuff, but it was one of these G meetings and Donald Trump, I think it was in 2018 [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3651.6400000000003s)]
*  or 19. He threw it out to the room. He goes, well, how about this? How about we all just eliminate [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3657.1600000000003s)]
*  tariffs? And then I'll agree to do that too. So it's like his mind is there sometimes, but then [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3662.2000000000003s)]
*  it's often this other place where he's judging like, okay, there's an argument to that. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3668.44s)]
*  I don't exactly agree with it, but okay, you can make an argument. And then there's an argument to [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3673.8s)]
*  things like whatever, like when he threatens Canada or Mexico with tariffs, and then they put troops [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3678.52s)]
*  on the border and then he pulls back and doesn't do the tariffs. That's hard to argue that it's [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3684.2000000000003s)]
*  not like, okay, that was a win. Like he just got a good policy out of a threat of a bad policy. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3688.1200000000003s)]
*  So I'm not arguing that like there are things that are more complicated than just my desert [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3693.4s)]
*  island, 101 economics example of trading between two people. But that's not what we're talking [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3698.84s)]
*  about. What you're talking about here is basing your tariff policy off of a trade imbalance. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3707.48s)]
*  Again, this is back to saying the supermarket's ripping me off because I spend all my money there [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3713.48s)]
*  and they don't spend any other money at my house. This is goofy economics. It doesn't make any sense [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3719.4s)]
*  at all. This is not reciprocal tariffs. This is not, it just doesn't make any sense. And I'll be [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3725.0s)]
*  honest. I mean, I don't know if this is going to get shut down or not, but I've been shocked so far [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3730.84s)]
*  that markets haven't been reacting more to this. I think it's almost that they're dumbfounded and [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3735.8s)]
*  they can't believe this is actually going to happen, but this is, you know, whatever. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3740.04s)]
*  We didn't talk about it on Rogan's podcast, so I thought I would do the episode on it today, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3745.9599999999996s)]
*  but I got to say this is just, this is an indefensibly bad policy and it really could be [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3750.2s)]
*  quite devastating. You know, talking about putting these huge tariffs. Look, the last thing I'll say [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3758.2s)]
*  about this, okay, is that I understand why people have nationalistic tendencies. I agree with a lot [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3763.7999999999997s)]
*  of those tendencies. I think that in the era of transnational corporations and globalist politicians, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3772.68s)]
*  it is almost as if this lack of national cohesiveness, it's an attack on national [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3783.0s)]
*  cohesiveness and national unity. And that is something that I think people rightfully resist. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3792.2799999999997s)]
*  I understand why people have this feeling that like the world is ripping us off [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3800.04s)]
*  and we want to do what's best for our country. I am an America first person, to the extent that [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3805.64s)]
*  we have a government, it ought to be servicing the American people who fund it. However, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3811.32s)]
*  if you have something like some other country, let's just say is producing steel [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3820.6s)]
*  and they're producing it very affordably and very in large quantity. Now it is true that that [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3828.2s)]
*  might put, that might be bad for our steel plants here because now you can get really cheap, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3838.36s)]
*  really good steel from another country. It's way cheaper than it is buying it here. So that would [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3845.0s)]
*  be bad for our producers, but it would be great for the customers. It's good for the customers [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3849.88s)]
*  if they can get a better, cheaper good. And so you can just see where it's not just the national [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3858.12s)]
*  interest. And in fact, it might even be much more in the national interest that it puts those steel [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3865.8s)]
*  plants out of business, but all of the American people get their steel cheaper, just in theory, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3870.36s)]
*  like if that was the example. And the other final thing I'll say, and then we could wrap up on this [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3877.32s)]
*  is that when Donald Trump is talking about this era where there was no regulation, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3881.96s)]
*  there was no taxes. I mean, I'm not saying by the way, I'm not saying there's zero, strictly [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3889.56s)]
*  speaking, zero regulation or zero taxes, but like there was no income tax and the federal register. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3893.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was just nothing compared to today. It's statistically zero. It's essentially zero [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3899.48s)]
*  taxes and zero regulation. And there were tariffs. And he goes, oh, back then we had all this [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3904.92s)]
*  production here. We had all, well, a huge part of the rise of the overtaxing and overregulation, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3912.12s)]
*  like a rise in big government. And then what big government does is they overtax and overregulate [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3923.16s)]
*  everything. That's also a huge part of what's made it impossible to produce here. And so if you really [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3927.88s)]
*  did have this national instinct, like if you want, because maybe you could make an argument that like, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3933.08s)]
*  okay, Dave, your point about cheap steel makes sense in abstract economics. But in real life, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3937.56s)]
*  if a war broke out, we can't be dependent on that country for steel because we got to be able to [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3945.64s)]
*  produce our own steel here. Like, okay, I could see in some sense, there might be an argument to that. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3949.72s)]
*  But then in that case, what Donald Trump should be doing here is attacking the regulatory state and [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3955.16s)]
*  the taxation, make it much cheaper and much easier to produce here. And then we could build up our [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3961.08s)]
*  productive capacity and have the American consumer able to buy from all of these different producers. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3968.04s)]
*  So again, I just think this is backward and wrong. And it demonstrates a real lack of understanding [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3975.88s)]
*  of basic economics from the president and much of his base. Okay, I'm going to wrap up on that. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3981.64s)]
*  Thank you guys very much for all the kind words on the internet. And thanks for listening to the [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3987.88s)]
*  show. As always appreciate you guys. Catch you next time. Peace. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiQ7xewUDcM&t=3993.88s)]
