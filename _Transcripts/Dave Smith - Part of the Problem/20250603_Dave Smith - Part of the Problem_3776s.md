# Dave Smith | The Most Pathetic Argument | Part Of The Problem 1271
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY)
*  Hello, hello, what's up everybody? Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Dave Smith. He is Robbie the fire Bernstein. We are live. We are all together in studio. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  You're back. That's right. Like a like a dysfunctional family that you know, has been separated for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=18.88s)]
*  a prolonged period of time. There's some abuse allegations, but at the end of the day, we [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  all still love each other, you know? Yeah, welcome back from the road. Thank you, sir. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=28.12s)]
*  How your travels been going? Oh, is Newark still almost I've had a few weeks off here [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=32.96s)]
*  and I have not been keeping up. Is it still like you don't fly into Newark? No, I fly. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=38.92s)]
*  Well, yesterday was JFK. I had the greatest weekend out in Texas. All the shows were great, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=43.36s)]
*  but it's go mode. It's wake up. He drives to the next location. It's getting after it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=48.16s)]
*  But I was joking last night that I think I just need to start like losing my shit earlier [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=52.92s)]
*  because the universe seems to want to push you to that breaking point. And so I was smooth all day. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=57.32s)]
*  It was it was a long workday. And then I-95 at 1 30 in the morning driving back from the airport [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=62.68s)]
*  was just shut down for construction. I just sat on the highway for like a half hour after like the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=68.04s)]
*  five hour plane ride in the sitting in the airport. And I was like, all right, university got me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=74.36s)]
*  This is my breaking point. You found it. That is. Yeah, that's rough. That sucks. But anyways, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=78.68s)]
*  it was a great time out in Texas. Now I got 10 days out west. So working backwards, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=84.2s)]
*  Las Vegas and playing the club out there. You can find that on their website. That's wise, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=89.08s)]
*  guys. Then me and you Salt Lake City. Those were great shows last year. And then I got a Reno, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  San Jose, Sandpoint and Portland. Nice, nice, nice. Yeah. Looking forward to going back out [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=97.64s)]
*  to Salt Lake City. Those the Mormons show up for us and they laugh at filthy stuff. They're so [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  repressed. Yeah, no, they're dying for it. That's as close listening to Rob Bernstein's comedy is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=109.72s)]
*  as close as Mormons are allowed to like experiencing happiness. So like that's that's it. They could [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=114.76s)]
*  only get through you. I remember last year someone had told me some things just get bad information. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=120.28s)]
*  Someone said, you know, that club makes you work clean. And I go, no one told me that. And I don't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=124.36s)]
*  have clean. I'm doing what I do. I hope that's not a problem. That is Rob working clean. You're [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=129.16s)]
*  watching right now. So I showed up a little bit nervous that maybe it was a more conservative [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  market. And then I remember that first show I just told some filthy soaking joke right up front. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=139.16s)]
*  And it was like a big blast. I was like, now these people rule. Yeah, I remember. I remember [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=143.48s)]
*  you saying something about that to me and being like, I just go do what you do. And like, but like [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=148.12s)]
*  I always it's a weird like it's a weird dynamic. But this happens a lot in comedy where sometimes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=153.0s)]
*  the people who you would think are you almost get in your own head and you're like, oh, they're [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=161.32s)]
*  not going to like this filthy joke. But then the person who looks like they were actually [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=166.2s)]
*  loves it the most. You know what I mean? Because like they kind of need that. This is the only time [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  they're getting that. They're bringing hope to these Mormons. I don't care what anybody says. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=175.48s)]
*  Excuse me. All right. So by the way, I just some somebody just informed me on Twitter earlier today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=181.16s)]
*  But it was people were sharing a bunch of the clips from my Chris Cuomo debate, which was [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  evidently a year ago. It's like a couple days ago, I think, actually. But I think it might be a year [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=195.64s)]
*  ago that like it was the clips were being posted. But yeah, one year anniversary. I've taken that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=201.64s)]
*  man's soul. I've taken of claiming a Cuomo soul. We need to get a fake fireplace place here. And [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=207.0s)]
*  then like fake pictures as if we got the heads on the mantle. Yeah. Oh, there you go. All the debate [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=213.64s)]
*  victims. I'll tell you who my next one is that I'm working on is Dave Rubin. Fun. Because he was [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=218.68s)]
*  talking all types of shit about me. And so that I challenged him and he said, you know, in some [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=224.68s)]
*  snotty way was like, Oh, when I get back from that tiny little country that rules your mind or [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=231.72s)]
*  something, because I guess he's in Israel, but he agreed to it, trying to see if Patrick Bette David [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  will do that one another Cuomo style. I want to I just thought for that one, it should be like [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  a three hour live debate. And yeah, I think that'll be I think that one would be a lot of fun. I [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=245.16s)]
*  think people would enjoy it. Another head from the mantle. I like it. Dave Smith collection. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=253.0s)]
*  Well, it's like, I don't know why. I mean, like Dave Rubin is like a big enough guy. He's got [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=257.88s)]
*  millions of followers. He's got a big channel. Me and him were always kind of cool. Like we're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=263.24s)]
*  never like friends, but we were always cool. And we've done shows and we've been at events together [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=269.8s)]
*  and stuff. I always had nothing but nice things to say about me. And then of course, now now because [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=275.0s)]
*  I'm on the wrong side in his view of the Israel issue. Now he's just like someone. Someone asked [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=280.12s)]
*  him like a question at some Q&A thing. And they just asked him about the what he thought about [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=286.92s)]
*  the debate with me and Douglas Murray. And he just went on this whole thing about he goes, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=291.8s)]
*  Dave's an idiot. He doesn't know what he's talking about. And look, I'll allow a lot of people to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=294.68s)]
*  say I'm an idiot who doesn't know what he's talking about. Fair play for most people. Not [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=299.4s)]
*  Dave fucking Rubin. Like, I'm sorry, dude. Why specifically Dave Rubin? Like the fucking dumbest [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=304.84s)]
*  influencer in America. Like, I mean, listen, I know in general, my rule of thumb, which I'm trying to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  live by now is like, I'm looking for formidable debate opponents. Like when I want to, I want [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  to debate like, who's the who's the best you guys got on this subject? That's why I debated that Alex [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=323.23999999999995s)]
*  guy from Cato. He really is, I think, like the best guy on the open borders libertarian side. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=328.84s)]
*  He wore a suit and brought a folder and everything. Yeah, he's a suit and folder guy, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=334.6s)]
*  you know, that's what. So I'm not trying to not just like, but then so this is more in the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=338.20000000000005s)]
*  in the mold of like the Laura Loomer debate. But at the same time, you know, every now and then, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  if someone who's got a huge audience is talking crazy shit about me, I feel like that's like, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=349.72s)]
*  okay, so let's see. Let's see who knows what they're talking about. Dave, how long in Israel for [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=354.68s)]
*  because you got a lot of reading to do to catch up to know as little as I know about this shit. So [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=360.44s)]
*  let's go. You're throwing some good shit talk at him telling him that he's got Laura Loomer status. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, he already agreed to it and I will shame him endlessly now if he backs out, which I think [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=370.44s)]
*  there's a chance he might. But hopefully, I was surprised that he even agreed. So like, let's see [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=375.96000000000004s)]
*  what's up. How many more till you get your hands on Ben Shapiro? How many more do you ever do it? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=381.0s)]
*  I don't think he'll ever do it. That's my guess. But I don't know. Isn't it crazy? I know I've made [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=387.24s)]
*  this point before. But is it not crazy that he's never debated anyone on the topic? And tell me if [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=392.6s)]
*  I'm wrong about that? Maybe Natalie, maybe just even if you just like Google search that real quick. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=398.92s)]
*  I don't think and I'm not saying like, but you know, a rotating or like a student, a 20 year old [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  asking a question at college after a speech doesn't count. But like, has Ben Shapiro ever [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=408.6s)]
*  had a one on one debate against a competent opponent? And while you're on Google, if you can [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  ask them if I should shave my arms, they look disgusting on this camera. No, dude, you're [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=419.96s)]
*  Kip, man. Bro, you're fucking crushing it. It does appear to be mostly college students. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=424.28s)]
*  Yeah, college students. That's right. And then he said, so there's the clip of which is what comes [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  up, as I can see on Natalie's monitor there. But there's there's a clip where Rogan back in the day, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=434.76s)]
*  he was on Rogan and Rogan was like, I really love to see you debate someone on this. And then he [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  says, Sure, I'll do it. Yeah, they're both on the same side of that issue. That's not a fucking [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=446.68s)]
*  debate. Yeah, they probably debated other things. They probably debated other things and then talked [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=455.56s)]
*  about how they agreed about that shit or whatever. But yeah, that's who could talk fast and say less [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=461.32s)]
*  who can talk faster and be more dishonest competition. But yeah, it's like, so I don't [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=468.76s)]
*  know, I doubt I doubt he's gonna do it with me. But I'm ready if he wants to. Alright, guys, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=474.2s)]
*  let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is the wellness company. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=480.44s)]
*  Have you been feeling off since taking the COVID vaccine? You're not alone and new research backs [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=484.52s)]
*  it up in a groundbreaking study risk stratification for future cardiac arrest after the jab. Dr. Peter [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=490.44s)]
*  McCullough, who many of you know, was an absolute hero throughout the entire COVID insanity. He [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  highlights an alarming rise in sudden cardiac events among young and previously healthy [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=503.48s)]
*  individuals. His study found that tiny hidden patches of heart inflammation, often missed by [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=508.76s)]
*  doctors could silently be building up leading to a sudden heart attack during exercise or sleep. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=514.6s)]
*  That's why the wellness company created the three in one ultimate spike detox crafted with 100% [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  natural ingredients specifically designed to help your body clear harmful spike proteins, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=527.88s)]
*  reduce inflammation and support heart health. Don't wait until symptoms strike experience the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=533.64s)]
*  only formula approved and used by Dr. McCullough, a top freedom fighting doctor who risked it all [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=540.12s)]
*  to tell the truth during COVID. Head on over to TWC dot health slash problem and use the promo [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=547.08s)]
*  code problem to get 10% off plus free shipping. Again, that's TWC dot health slash problem [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=554.6s)]
*  promo code problem for 10% off and free shipping. All right, let's get back into the show. All right, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=562.36s)]
*  kind of on topic of this, but I did want to there's a couple clips. There's one that you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=568.52s)]
*  sent to me, Rob, that was, oh my God, difficult to get through. This one is also pretty brutal. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=573.72s)]
*  But I, you know, seeing as how this was something I don't know if I mentioned this on yesterday's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=580.2s)]
*  show. But the debate that I did on Pierce Morgan with Natasha blanking on her last name, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=584.6800000000001s)]
*  but the international lawyer. This was one of the things that came up in that debate, by the way, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=594.44s)]
*  it's out today. So if you're watching this live, it'll be out in a few hours, I think 2pm Eastern, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=599.5600000000001s)]

*  Okay, so anyway, this this kind of came up a little bit in our debate. And then here, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=631.56s)]
*  the first clip we're going to play is Barry Weiss, formerly of the New York Times. She's now with [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=636.12s)]
*  the Free Press, I believe is her her organization that she started. And here is she was on with our [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=643.16s)]
*  dear friends, Joe and Mika on MSNBC. Seeing eye to eye with the hosts of MSNBC, of course, but here is [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=651.48s)]
*  Barry Weiss talking about the rise of anti semitism. And of course, the the well, I don't [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=660.6s)]
*  know what I don't think anyone actually died in Colorado, I was gonna say the murders out there, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=668.44s)]
*  two people were murdered in DC, did anyone die in Colorado? Or were they like set on fire or whatever? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=672.12s)]
*  I don't exactly know the details. I believe there were deaths. Okay, maybe that's right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=676.44s)]
*  Okay. All right. So let's, let's play. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=682.44s)]
*  What feels different, Joe, is if we think back five, six years ago to the massacre that happened at [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=685.24s)]
*  the synagogue where I became a bat mitzvah tree of life in Pittsburgh, where 11 Jews were massacred, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=690.76s)]
*  there were two key differences. The first one is that the person that was radicalized [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=696.68s)]
*  seemed mentally deranged. The second thing is that there was universal condemnation and outrage [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=702.12s)]
*  by the surrounding culture. It was front page news. No one had any trouble condemning it. No [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=708.68s)]
*  one had any trouble calling it for what it was, which was absolutely evil. So fast forward to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=713.8s)]
*  these two recent attacks, the perpetrator in the case of the DC rampage, the murder of your own [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=720.04s)]
*  Lashinsky and Sarah Milgram, two names that should be known to everyone in this country, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=726.68s)]
*  but you will see no celebrities making videos, making sure that we know that the perpetrator [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=730.92s)]
*  making sure that we know and say their names. He was extraordinarily articulate. He was evil [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=737.16s)]
*  when you read his manifesto, but it was an incredibly coherent, if not morally upside [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=743.7199999999999s)]
*  down worldview. So that's the first thing. He was radicalized by a movement that has created a [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=748.8399999999999s)]
*  permission structure for violence and the hunting of publicly recognized Jews in this country. The [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=754.52s)]
*  second thing is the unbelievable silence of the surrounding culture. And if not silence, open [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=761.96s)]
*  glorification on the part of some leftist groups that are celebrating this attack. That is the core [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=768.76s)]
*  difference that we've seen over the span of those five or six years. And I think one of the things [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=776.12s)]
*  that's been so alarming to watch in this country is that since October 7th, the open antisemitism [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=780.6s)]
*  in this country has become more profound, not less. And I think it's profoundly unfortunate [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=789.16s)]
*  that people do not understand the history and do not understand that what begins with Jews does not [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=797.8s)]
*  end with Jews. Fundamentally, what this is about is an attack on the rule of law, attack on the idea [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=804.68s)]
*  that individuals, minorities in this country should be safe, and fundamentally an attack on the West [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=811.88s)]
*  and on America itself. What starts with the Jews doesn't end with the Jews. And the lesson of [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=818.28s)]
*  history, unfortunately, is people often don't realize that until it's too late. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=823.8s)]
*  All right. So there you have it from Barry Weiss. I guess I would start by saying [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=828.8399999999999s)]
*  it's one of these examples where I feel like people kind of like, they almost just make up [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=838.36s)]
*  the world that they're living in to suit their narrative. Like, I genuinely don't know what the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=846.04s)]
*  hell she's talking about when she's saying that people have trouble condemning these attacks. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=851.48s)]
*  I would describe them as pretty universally condemned. I don't know who I mean, I'm not [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=858.12s)]
*  saying like you can't find anyone who has a crazy view and goes, Yes, that was great. But [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=863.8s)]
*  there's about as broad a consensus as there is on anything. It's probably up there with like [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=869.72s)]
*  pedophiles are bad, that people go like, Yeah, you can't murder people. You know, that's horrible [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=875.4s)]
*  to do that. So I just don't think that's right. I don't think I mean, obviously, you know, it's a [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=881.88s)]
*  little bit strange when you see, like, you would look at say, where the administration is, I mean, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=888.04s)]
*  we're going to stay on this topic for a little bit here, but where the administration is on [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=894.4399999999999s)]
*  anti semitism, the amount of speech laws that have been passed, the amount of support Israel [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=898.84s)]
*  gets from this administration, the last administration, every administration. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=903.8s)]
*  Obviously, she's on MSNBC right now, the two hosts are completely agreeing with her. I don't know how [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=908.28s)]
*  you can get from that to like, nobody's willing to condemn this. It's like, yeah, it's horrible. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=914.4399999999999s)]
*  And nobody like I don't know, I don't think any reasonable person is defending this. That might [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=921.16s)]
*  be a little bit of a tautology. But I'm just saying, like, I don't think that's actually an [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=926.68s)]
*  accurate claim. It's kind of like when a lot of these a lot of the pro Israel people will say [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=931.16s)]
*  things like, nobody condemned October 7, when it happened, the world couldn't even condemn that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=937.0s)]
*  And you're like, what world were you living in? Like, everybody was condemning it. Everybody I [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=943.2399999999999s)]
*  know was condemning it. Everyone I see is condemning it. In fact, I can't believe like, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  for the first year, it took like a full year of Israel's destruction of Gaza before the first [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=953.24s)]
*  question I'd get asked on every single interview would be, do you condemn the atrocity of October [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=959.88s)]
*  7? Like that it was just, oh, you know, and always be like, yes, of course, that's bad. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=965.8s)]
*  But essentially, Rob, and you know this, right? What she's engaging in, which is also at one [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=971.0799999999999s)]
*  point what this international lawyer who I was debate or this lawyer who I was debating on Pierce [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=978.52s)]
*  Morgan did was it is just and I really I can't express how much contempt I have for people who [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=983.96s)]
*  use this line of political argumentation. There is there is no lower form of political argument, no [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=992.6s)]
*  more dishonorable form of political argument than there's an act of violence that's randomly [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1000.04s)]
*  committed. And then I'm going to say that you are actually the one who created the fertile ground [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1007.64s)]
*  for this random act of violence. It's just pathetic. And that's what she's setting up here. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1014.2s)]
*  Any any thoughts, Rob? I don't like listening to her. I feel like I'm in trouble with my mom. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1019.64s)]
*  She does have that vibe. So I'd like to start off by saying that I think the better conversation [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1025.64s)]
*  to be had in this instance is the problem with the illegal immigration and the fact that people [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1033.96s)]
*  are in this country illegally. Yeah, I mean, that's that's the other thing. And I don't think you even [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1038.52s)]
*  need to have much of a conversation in regards to this particular instance of American anti-Semitism [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1043.48s)]
*  because this was a legal foreign national who was living in the United States of America who [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1049.4s)]
*  shouldn't shouldn't have been here. Not to be fair, not in D.C., but that is the case in the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1054.6000000000001s)]
*  Colorado. Yes, yes. No, I mean, I think you're certainly right about that. I also do [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1058.52s)]
*  just think like it's it's remarkable to me that people like Barry Weiss, she could say [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1063.72s)]
*  with a straight face, you know, she she can go, you know, OK, so there was this attack on a synagogue [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1074.52s)]
*  five years ago. It was universally condemned. But we've actually seen and she says we've actually [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1080.52s)]
*  seen a rise of anti-Semitism since October 7th. And she says it as if like it's like, well, look, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1086.6s)]
*  you know, the Jews were like attacked and anti-Semitism has gone up since the attack as if [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1093.8s)]
*  there was nothing else there. Like you're just going to yada yada over the 20 months of the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1100.28s)]
*  absolute destruction of a captive people. Like what I don't know, it's just too. It's also if [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1106.36s)]
*  you're if you're trying to define or if your mind you define being anti-Israel as being anti-Semitic, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1112.84s)]
*  then yes, there's been a rise of anti-Semitism in this country. But if you don't define taking a [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1119.0s)]
*  stance against Israel as being anti-Semitic, I'm not sure that there's a rise in anti-Semitism. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1124.6s)]
*  And then furthermore, there's a way and we're going to see another clip of this, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1131.3999999999999s)]
*  but there's an even bigger problem of trying to pretend that being pro-Palestinian actually makes [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1134.4399999999998s)]
*  you pro-Hamas and they're really trying to blur these lines. Yeah. Oh, there's no question. I mean, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1139.8s)]
*  it's look there is there is nobody, nobody in America, you know, it's a little bit different [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1145.0s)]
*  in Israel. The dynamics a little bit different there, but there's no one who's critical of Israel [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1155.8s)]
*  in America who has not been called an anti-Semite at one point, including Jews. No, you know what I [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1162.92s)]
*  mean? Like nobody has not been called an anti-Semite. It doesn't matter how much you know, I said this [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1170.44s)]
*  at one point when I was on Rogan, but I was like, you know, the guys like Tucker Carlson and Thomas [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1176.1200000000001s)]
*  Massey get called anti-Semitic by professional people in polite circles. These are people who [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1183.72s)]
*  have never once in their life said the Jews ever like they just never talk that way. They're just [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1190.84s)]
*  not like that. And so it's so right. Yes. If you're if you're defining anti-Semitism as you know, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1197.9599999999998s)]
*  they're freaking I saw people calling Miss Rachel an anti-Semite. Who's Miss fucking Rachel? Who's [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1204.04s)]
*  Miss Rachel? Oh, yeah, there's a good reason you shouldn't know. So Miss Rachel is she does like [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1210.1999999999998s)]
*  children's programming. My kids watched her. It's like my kids have aged out of her a little bit. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1217.72s)]
*  She's like for little kids, but she does. It's actually really good. She does like educational [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1223.8799999999999s)]
*  programming, but she does it with like, like she must have been trained as like a speech therapist [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1230.76s)]
*  or something like that. But she does all these like techniques that are like actually really good [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1237.1599999999999s)]
*  for like babies. It gets them like talking and thinking and then she does songs and like it's [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1241.1599999999999s)]
*  it's like it's like a Sesame Street on YouTube, but but better like scientifically better. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1246.2s)]
*  And she's enormously successful. It's like her views. You get into these things when you have [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1253.0s)]
*  kids where you like find like these shows on YouTube and you're like, oh, it's a cute little [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1258.3600000000001s)]
*  show we found. And then you look at the end. It's 80 million people have seen it. And you're like, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1262.3600000000001s)]
*  oh, this is bigger than anything in the world. So she's huge. She's like blew up. Parents love her [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1265.72s)]
*  because it's actually like it's like quality programming for, you know, little kids. And she's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1273.16s)]
*  clearly a lefty. She never says anything political in her shows, but like her one of her partners is [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1278.8400000000001s)]
*  like a trans person in there. Yeah, but it's not like playing like a Barney character. No, it's a [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1286.92s)]
*  it's a it's a a chick. It's a woman who's like seem at least presents as transgender. But like, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1293.48s)]
*  that's never the topic. It's not like they're just singing songs and shit. And it's less [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1301.56s)]
*  flagrant than when dudes are trying to be women. So yeah, we don't really have a problem with that. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1305.8s)]
*  We're pro-lesbo over here on this show. But so so anyway, she's nothing about it's ever been [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1309.6399999999999s)]
*  political. And she just was like, like had I think a few posts about how she's so sad for the babies [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1315.72s)]
*  in Gaza, because she loves kids. And she loves all kids. And like all kids have value. That's [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1322.12s)]
*  literally what she's got. And then she did this thing, which I will say it literally it just [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1328.12s)]
*  really got to me. Actually, this guy was crying when I saw this. But she did this thing where some [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1332.2s)]
*  some little girl who got her leg blown off in Gaza now has like an artificial leg. And she did a video [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1338.76s)]
*  with her where she like sang a song and the little Mr. Rogers where they put on shoes together. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1344.2s)]
*  No, no, they didn't do shoes. But it's really I mean, it is, you know, it's like it's the song [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1347.8799999999999s)]
*  that my kids used to dance to. And so it's just it really got me. But anyway, that's it. They're [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1353.08s)]
*  calling her a Jew hater just for being like, hey, babies, like it's so insane. You can't like it. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1358.04s)]
*  But again, look, I would say look, according to my Twitter feed, it does seem like there's been a [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1364.52s)]
*  rise in in like, whatever you want to call it, like there's a rise in people like talking about [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1373.1599999999999s)]
*  the Jews in a not very nice way. But again, it just it seems to me to be [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1380.04s)]
*  baffling. Like it's when you're saying, OK, after October 7th, we actually saw an increase in [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1387.56s)]
*  anti-Semitism. And you're saying as if like the Jews get attacked and then you hate them more for [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1394.84s)]
*  being attacked and you're not pointing out the tens of thousands of dead babies since then. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1399.8s)]
*  Like that's not going to come up. It's literally like on the level of like if you if you got I [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1406.04s)]
*  don't know, you bring flowers to your wife and she goes, I just got off the phone with your mistress [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1412.76s)]
*  and found out that you've been cheating on me for five years. I'm furious at you. And you go, I bring [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1418.52s)]
*  you flowers and you're furious. That's your response to flowers. And you're like, you're just [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1423.08s)]
*  going to yada yada over that middle part. Like that was the whole thing. So like, I'm sorry. But [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1429.4s)]
*  the rise in criticism and hatred of of Israel and more broadly of Jewish people is very clearly a [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1435.3999999999999s)]
*  result of this. To deny that, you'd have to be arguing it's just a coincidence. It's a gigantic [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1445.56s)]
*  coincidence that over the last 20 months we've seen this increase. And again, as I've said before [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1451.56s)]
*  on the show, I don't think it's right to blame Jewish people for the crimes of a government. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1455.9599999999998s)]
*  I think that does not follow at all. I'm not letting those people off the hook. Those people [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1464.0400000000002s)]
*  have agency and they're responsible for their actions or their words. But you know, again, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1468.6000000000001s)]
*  as I've said before, if a bunch of black people go into an area and just start jumping people, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1477.0800000000002s)]
*  beating them up and mugging them. And this happens over and over again. Do you could you predict [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  that the level of like anti black racism is going to go up, go down or stay the same? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1491.32s)]
*  It seems like a reasonable prediction that probably it'll go up a little bit. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1499.96s)]
*  That might be one of the costs of say black crime in a specific area is that people end up being [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1504.6s)]
*  more suspicious or hostile toward black people in general. Now, that's not the appropriate response. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1511.08s)]
*  It's not fair to blame a black dude who had nothing to do with that. But at the same time, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1517.24s)]
*  you know, if you're going to like look at this and not even address that factor, like, sorry, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1521.48s)]
*  you're not really having a real conversation now. You're just spouting propaganda. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1527.72s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Prolon by [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1532.76s)]
*  El Nutra. Prolon is a plant based nutrition program featuring soups, snacks and beverages [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1538.1200000000001s)]
*  designed to nourish the body while keeping it in a fasting state, triggering cellular rejuvenation [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1545.08s)]
*  and renewal. The next gen builds on the original Prolon with 100% organic soups and teas, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1551.56s)]
*  a richer taste and ready to eat meals developed over decades at USC's Longevity Institute and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1558.36s)]
*  backed by top US medical centers. Prolon has been shown to support biological age reduction, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1564.76s)]
*  metabolic health and skin appearance. Look, you've heard a lot about the fasting diets and [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1570.76s)]
*  all this intermediate fasting. Now there's a way to basically trick your body into thinking it's [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1576.44s)]
*  fasting without having to give up food. So definitely check this out. And for a limited time, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1581.48s)]
*  you can be first in line to experience the next gen at special savings. Prolon is offering part [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1585.96s)]
*  of the problem listeners 15% off site wide plus a $40 bonus gift when you subscribe to their five [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1592.2s)]

*  Okay, let's move over to the I think would also help if people like Barry Weiss didn't go on the [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1611.56s)]
*  news and ask, ask so chewy. You know, I mean, like, give it a shot, like, just try me and you, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1617.4s)]
*  we're doing our part and being less chewy. So just take it, follow our lead and just be less [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1622.8400000000001s)]
*  chewy. And then people will dislike us as much. I mean, it is, you know, in life in general, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1628.6s)]
*  just being cool goes a long way. It's like, just be cool. That'll probably help. But that's not in [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1633.8s)]
*  the cards for everybody. All right, this next clip, you said this one was tough to get through. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1642.12s)]
*  But so Scott Jennings, who I've always not particularly cared for, nothing against him [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1647.48s)]
*  personally. I don't know that much about him. I know that he's a Bush era Republican. And I tend [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1656.92s)]
*  to just kind of dismiss those guys, you know, some forms of prejudice are necessary. And you just at [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  a certain point, you're like, I can't, you know, I can't memorize everybody's fucking, you know, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1671.4s)]
*  history. But there's something about him what I don't care for. And this is a there's there's a, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1676.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, a larger dynamic, which we've talked about on the show. But this was true, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1682.04s)]
*  kind of throughout all of wokeism, where there would become these like conservative fire brands [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1686.84s)]
*  who would rise up because they're taking on wokeism. And then it's almost like because people like [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1693.72s)]
*  that they're dunking on these people, you almost like they get a free pass on whatever awful views [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1700.92s)]
*  they may have, or whatever awful track record they may have. You know, you think there's lots [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1708.76s)]
*  of examples of this, but where people will be, you know, it's like, okay, I think like trans ideology [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1713.64s)]
*  is kind of crazy. And I think that the way that it was pushed on society was appalling. But then [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1720.52s)]
*  you'll have some, you know, conservative, who's like, you know, was was lecturing every but was [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1728.2s)]
*  supporting lockdowns was supporting the wars was lecturing everybody to take their COVID vaccine [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1735.72s)]
*  was, you know, like, oh, just terrible and everything. But then they'll be like, you're not a [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1741.0s)]
*  dude, you're a chick. And I'm supposed to give this person some type of credit for that. Like, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1745.56s)]
*  I'm supposed to be like, oh, this guy's really nailing it, like, you got the most simple thing [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1750.92s)]
*  right, and everything that matters wrong. And so I do, I'm not saying this is exactly the case with [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1755.96s)]
*  Scott. But I do think that it's like, he sits around on these CNN panels with the dumbest [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1761.32s)]
*  fucking people making the most pathetic arguments. And then everyone's like, look, he owned the room. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1768.36s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, you put anyone competent in there, and they're going to own that room. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1774.84s)]
*  It's like, I don't, I'm not impressed. But anyway, he's become the guy who is like the only thing [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1779.1599999999999s)]
*  that's consistently going viral on CNN is him destroying all the libs. Anyway, this was, this [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1786.6s)]
*  was from from, I don't know, Rob, you sent this to me. Where is this yesterday? Something? It's [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1795.32s)]
*  pretty recent. Recently, we're back to Jake Tapper. Yeah, oh, that's right. There we go. All right. So [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1800.4399999999998s)]
*  let's play the let's let's play this clip. No further ado. And what more do we need to see, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1806.12s)]
*  Jake, before we realize this free Palestine movement is nothing more than a domestic terror [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1811.1599999999999s)]
*  organization right now. I mean, we had the killings in Washington a couple of weeks ago. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1816.52s)]
*  We had this issue in Colorado. We've seen, you know, the activities on college campuses now for [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1820.6s)]
*  months and months and months and months, the rise of anti semitism in America, the rise in the number [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1826.1999999999998s)]
*  of people who have come to America, who hold anti American views, anti Western views and anti [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1831.6399999999999s)]
*  Semitic views and are now willing to act on it. It is absolutely outrageous. And I think as a society, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1837.16s)]
*  we need to understand we are dealing with domestic terrorism. It's growing more violent by the day. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1843.16s)]
*  And if we don't deal with it, these kinds of things are going to keep happening in cities all [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1848.28s)]
*  over the place. It's awful. And we need to come to grips with the fight that we're in right now in [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1851.48s)]
*  America fight for the future of our country and the future of Western civilization, in my opinion. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1855.88s)]
*  David Axelrod. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1860.28s)]
*  Yeah, no, listen, Jake, I'm the son of a Jewish refugee who escaped. His home was blown up and [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1863.72s)]
*  he escaped from actually Ukraine back in the day and came here to seek refuge. And so, you know, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1871.0s)]
*  I feel very, very do I'm not I haven't come to this lately. I feel very deeply about this issue. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1879.64s)]
*  And I think questions will be asked about how this guy tried to get a gun. He was refused the [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1887.0s)]
*  gun because he was he was not supposed to be in the country and nothing was done about that. I [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1892.28s)]
*  think that is a fair question to ask. But we also you know, when we when I was in the White House, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1898.6s)]
*  it was the FBI who kept close tabs on all of this stuff. I don't know why they failed there. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1904.84s)]
*  And I think and I'm worried a little bit about what's going on now because there's a shift [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1910.84s)]
*  away from that work to other kinds of work. And I think it makes us more vulnerable. So there are [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1914.84s)]
*  serious there's there are serious questions to be asked about this. I don't think it's the occasion [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1920.9199999999998s)]
*  for sort of blanket condemnation of everyone who may feel critical of the Israeli policies in Gaza. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1926.4399999999998s)]
*  But certainly, I agree with Scott that it's alarming to see this uptick in anti-Semitism, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1937.56s)]
*  which you know, Jake has been going on for years, even before October 7. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1943.32s)]
*  All right. So, I mean, look, I don't know, we can get into this a little bit. But what Scott [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1949.96s)]
*  Jennings is doing there is exactly what I just said about Barry Weiss. It is there is no lower [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1957.32s)]
*  form of political argumentation than saying and I made this point on the Piers Morgan show, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1963.96s)]
*  where I was like, Hey, Pierce, like, you know, I've been coming on your show now for the last [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1970.4399999999998s)]
*  two years pretty regularly. I'm on the show just about once a week or something like that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1976.04s)]
*  Maybe once every other week, but I've come on I've been on Piers Morgan show many times at this point. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1983.1599999999999s)]
*  And I go, Hey, there was an incident where I don't know if you even remember this, Rob, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1987.8799999999999s)]
*  but there was a guy in Florida, a Jewish guy who shot two people because he thought they were [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1991.6399999999999s)]
*  Palestinian. Now, ironically, they were Israeli. But regardless, he shot them because he thought [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=1997.72s)]
*  they were Palestinian. And this was in his own words. And I go, you might notice I never brought [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2004.6000000000001s)]
*  that up. And then laid that at the feet of the pro-Israel opponent of mine, because it's just [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2010.1200000000001s)]
*  pathetic. It's and I said, I'm a free market libertarian capitalist. I don't like democratic [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2016.76s)]
*  socialism. But when that Bernie Sanders fan went and shot up the congressional baseball game, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2023.8s)]
*  I never brought that up in a debate with a socialist like, Aha, you see your views lead to [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2029.6399999999999s)]
*  a world where some guy did this and that because it's fucking pathetic. And I feel like a gross [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2036.76s)]
*  human being if I ever used that line of argumentation. And it's no different than what they're doing right [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2042.68s)]
*  now. And the idea that people who are supporting the Palestinians are a terrorist organization [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2047.96s)]
*  for the crime of chanting a phrase you don't like or something like that. This is utter madness, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2062.76s)]
*  just insanity. And again, you know, I don't know enough about, like the culture on college campuses [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2071.32s)]
*  today. I'm sure there's lots about it that I would not like. And I'm sure that if I were to just grab [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2080.36s)]
*  the average college student, and let's say we just grab the average college student who's at one of [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2088.52s)]
*  these protests, and we brought him on the podcast, we talked to him for three hours, I'm sure that [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2094.44s)]
*  me and you, Rob, would have a very different worldview than that, you know, college campus [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2099.64s)]
*  protester. But I also just don't trust any of these kind of like blanket condemnations. I don't [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2105.16s)]
*  trust the media's characterization of these. I do just know, look, I know that there's been a ton of [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2113.56s)]
*  Jewish students who are down there protesting with them. And in fact, as I've mentioned before on the [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2119.64s)]
*  show, I know that they had a Passover Seder at the Columbia project, which are supposed to be like [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2123.72s)]
*  the worst ones. And they had a Passover Seder with the Jewish students and Muslim students all [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2129.64s)]
*  doing it to all, you know, doing their little Seder together. I don't know, doesn't seem like [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2135.0s)]
*  the motivating factor there was a hatred of Jewish people. But it is like, it's just incredibly [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2140.3599999999997s)]
*  dishonest to frame the issue this way. And it's a very dangerous precedent for the government to [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2147.64s)]
*  now be saying that, I mean, like, if you really think about this, is like, if you protest, because [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2156.92s)]
*  this isn't just an Israeli destruction of Gaza, this is an American foreign policy. These are [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2162.92s)]
*  our bombs that are being dropped on children. And you're going to say now that if the American people [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2169.08s)]
*  want to protest their government's foreign policy by protesting it, they are labeled terrorists. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2175.48s)]
*  Like, this is the guy I'm supposed to be impressed with on CNN. And you get what I'm saying about how [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2185.0s)]
*  you just, anybody who's a George W. Bush Republican, you just immediately hate them. That should be your [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2189.64s)]
*  starting point, hate them. Because what are they? They're this. They're the people who, when it [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2194.2s)]
*  actually matters, are going to say, yeah, protesting your government makes you a terrorist. It is wild [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2198.36s)]
*  to me, Rob. Wild to me that right wingers did not learn this lesson after January 6th. That you [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2203.64s)]
*  really, that's the precedent you want to set? That the people who oppose the regime can be labeled [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2211.96s)]
*  terrorists? You realize they just did this to you. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2217.88s)]
*  sponsor for today's show, which is Monetary Metals, an amazing company. I've been telling you guys [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2222.52s)]
*  about them for years. I love the guys who run this company, and they have really revolutionized the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2227.16s)]
*  precious metal space. If you own physical gold or silver, but you're just, it's just collecting dust [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2232.12s)]
*  at home, or worse, you're paying storage fees to have it professionally stored, you should take a [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2238.6s)]
*  look at Monetary Metals. Because with Monetary Metals, you don't just own gold or silver, you [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2243.48s)]
*  own gold or silver that's working for you, generating interest in additional ounces. So if [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2248.44s)]
*  you're owned gold, you're going to be paid interest in ounces of gold. So this way you're not just [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2253.88s)]
*  paying for storage fees, losing money, you're making money and you're making real money, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2259.0s)]
*  which is gold and silver. Check them out at monetary-metals.com. That's monetary-metals.com. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2263.64s)]
*  All right, let's get back on the show. Anyway, any thoughts, Rob? Jump on in. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2271.72s)]
*  Yeah, I just, I find floating around the title of domestic terrorism to be quite scary. I think [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2276.2s)]
*  there's a lot of opportunity to talk about prosecuting crimes and getting criminals when [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2284.44s)]
*  they engage in crime. Domestic terrorism, government pitches us on the fact that they can govern. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2291.88s)]
*  And then all of a sudden things get sloppy and they turn around and they go, well, we can't actually [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2298.36s)]
*  govern unless we take away people's rights. And so the way that we're going to actually do police [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2302.6s)]
*  work is instead of catching people when they're committing crimes, we're going to create this [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2307.32s)]
*  terrorism title and we're going to remove rights because then that's the only way that we can [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2311.48s)]
*  actually, this threat is so great, we can't actually do it through our criminal process. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2315.64s)]
*  We have to escalate it to a title of terrorism, but the idea is that you're like admitting that [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2320.2000000000003s)]
*  you can't actually govern properly. And the domestic terrorism, we played the clip on the [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2325.56s)]
*  show when they tried to, the guy who had worked at the FBI was trying to say that the January 6 [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2331.4s)]
*  people were domestic terrorists and all of that just leads to, well, who falls into the category [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2336.28s)]
*  of potential domestic terrorists and what kind of rights are you then removing to police their [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2341.8s)]
*  behavior? Are they actually committing crimes? And if you want to take it and stretch it that far to [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2347.0800000000004s)]
*  people who are pro-Palestinian, they try and blur the line that that means that they're actually [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2353.32s)]
*  pro-Hamas and that even just being pro-Palestinian now makes you a terrorist. So are we now censoring [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2358.6800000000003s)]
*  your speech on the internet? And listen, there was that case with a kid in Columbia who had his [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2364.36s)]
*  green card revoked. I don't even remember why that ended up happening, but he had a green card and [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2371.2400000000002s)]
*  he was married to a US citizen, had a child in America. Now it could be that that guy took part [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2375.7200000000003s)]
*  in violent organizations at Columbia. It could be. And they were saying that he was pro-Hamas. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2381.6400000000003s)]
*  It could be, but it could also be when you start hearing this rhetoric that the guy was just pro- [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2387.88s)]
*  Palestinian. Those are two different things. I don't know. I hate the concept of domestic terrorism [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2393.16s)]
*  title because I could easily see that being applied to myself. And so I just don't like the idea of [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2400.7599999999998s)]
*  government stripping my rights and censoring more than I already have been. And this is just so [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2406.8399999999997s)]
*  flagrant right here. And you see the danger of it because if being pro-Palestinian makes you pro-Hamas [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2412.92s)]
*  and makes you a terrorist. So firstly, I'm going to assume that all of your speech is going to be [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2420.68s)]
*  censored. That's just the end of free speech on this issue. But where does it go from there? If [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2424.8399999999997s)]
*  you're at a pro-Palestinian rally, you've just now outed yourself as a terrorist and rounding [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2429.08s)]
*  these people up. What's the actual application to him of this new title of... In theory, if I [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2434.2799999999997s)]
*  gave you control of the government right now and you said that these people are terrorists or we [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2442.44s)]
*  send them to Gitmo, what exactly are you prescribing? Look, I completely agree. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2445.7999999999997s)]
*  Everything you're saying. And I would just add that, look, as Noam Chomsky said, I really think [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2451.48s)]
*  he got this right, was he was like, the only coherent definition of terrorism is that it's [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2459.48s)]
*  terrorism when they do it and it's counterterrorism when we do it. You want to sit here and say that [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2466.8399999999997s)]
*  like, I don't know, invading Iraq wasn't terrorism. Or you want to say that us dropping drone bombs [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2474.9199999999996s)]
*  on weddings in Yemen is not terrorism. Okay. But really all you're left with is like, well, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2483.0s)]
*  because it was done by us and by a government and what, therefore it's not terrorism. You want to [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2490.68s)]
*  say that the IDF isn't a terrorist organization. Again, there's no... Just like give me the objective [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2496.8399999999997s)]
*  definition and you explained to me what it is. What is it? Targeting civilians? What do you think? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2503.48s)]
*  By the way, there's one of the things I was arguing with this lady about the other day, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2509.0s)]
*  which is so crazy, is that she's... I think I'm going to mention this on the show yesterday, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2512.68s)]
*  but that she's arguing that, oh, it wasn't fucked up for Israel to not let any food in because Hamas [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2516.2s)]
*  had the food and they were just hoarding it. And you're like, right. So then who are you keeping [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2523.08s)]
*  the food from? Not Hamas. You're targeting the civilian population. By the way, there's been... [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2527.2400000000002s)]
*  If you want to go through it, go to antiwar.com and just search through the last two years, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2533.64s)]
*  there's been example after example after example where civilians were targeted. I mean, civilians [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2538.52s)]
*  rushing to get aid, getting shot at, children being snipered, all types of examples of civilians [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2544.8399999999997s)]
*  being targeted. And so what this comes down to in a weird way is that it's like [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2553.8s)]
*  in order to have the worldview that every single Israel supporter has, in order to have it, as I've [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2563.4s)]
*  been making this case for almost two years now and I think I've done a pretty good job of demonstrating [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2571.32s)]
*  it, you have to on some level believe that the Palestinian life is just worth less if it's worth [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2577.32s)]
*  anything at all. It's just not worth as much as Israel. And you can see this in the rhetoric where, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2585.56s)]
*  look, even these two people in DC, let's say, who got killed. And right after it, it's like the way [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2592.52s)]
*  people flip out. And rightfully so. I mean, two fucking people got killed. It's goddamn horrible. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2598.52s)]
*  Those were real people. You know what I mean? They were as real as any of us were. They had [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2603.96s)]
*  people who loved them. They have people who are still grieving, who will never be made whole [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2608.12s)]
*  because these two people were taken out of their lives. It's horrible. But from the perspective of [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2613.64s)]
*  all of us, we're like, yeah, that's why we're against this policy because so many people are [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2619.32s)]
*  being killed. But they don't see it that way. But the problem is that even if you don't [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2626.52s)]
*  see it that way, if you just think Israeli life is more valuable than Palestinian life, American [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2633.8s)]
*  life is more valuable than Palestinian life, OK. But you have to at least recognize that not everyone's [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2638.28s)]
*  going to look at it that way, particularly Palestinians. But a lot of people around the [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2643.6400000000003s)]
*  world just are not going to look at it that way. It's not the most listen. I understand where, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2648.84s)]
*  say, Jewish people have more feeling toward Israel than they do toward other countries. I understand [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2654.1200000000003s)]
*  why Americans care more about Americans than they do about foreigners. I understand why [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2661.16s)]
*  Christian Europeans might have more of a connection to other Christian Europeans or to [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2667.16s)]
*  Americans or Canadians or whatever. There's a little bit of a shared culture and history there. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2675.48s)]
*  But then at the same token, if you're going to say that, then what do you think? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2682.3599999999997s)]
*  Like, wouldn't you see where a random Muslim might have more of a connection to Palestinians [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2685.56s)]
*  than he has to Israelis? Anyway, I say all of this to just make the point that it's the old Ron Paul [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2691.7999999999997s)]
*  point. If you think that we can just do this to people and pay no price for it, like that you can [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2697.48s)]
*  just engage in a goddamn genocide and fund and arm the whole thing and that that's not going to [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2705.16s)]
*  inspire hatred and that nobody out there is going to go, well, I'm going to grab a gun and [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2711.88s)]
*  go do something about this. I think that's a very naive way to look at the world. And so in effect, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2716.84s)]
*  this isn't removing responsibility from anyone. But this is one of the costs of this policy, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2723.2400000000002s)]
*  is this type of chaos. And it's not good. It's not good for anybody. All right, let's switch gears a [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2728.92s)]
*  little bit here because I did want to play this video a little bit maybe outside of our typical [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2737.64s)]
*  wheelhouse. But actually, it kind of relates to a lot of stuff that we talk about a lot. But there [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2743.56s)]
*  was this clip of Tommy Lauren on the Laura Ingram show that's been going super viral for obvious [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2747.48s)]
*  reasons once you see the clip. And there's a lot here. I found this very interesting. It's [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2757.72s)]
*  basically Tommy Lauren is trashing men. We're about to play particularly young men. We're about to [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2767.16s)]
*  play the clip. Now there's something about this kind of like the battle of the sexes type content [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2772.2s)]
*  that just gets a big reaction out of everyone. There's something like women venting about men [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2779.8s)]
*  is something that women tend to like enjoy. Oh my God, men are trash. Oh my God, yes, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2788.36s)]
*  men are trash. Everyone who's had a bad experience with a man now can get on board this. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2794.36s)]
*  And there is something that men, particularly when there's an attractive woman bashing men, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2798.28s)]
*  men love to hate that content. It's like catnip for the sexes. And I will preface by saying [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2808.84s)]
*  that I think it's one of my biggest objections to feminism, broadly speaking. I always think the [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2815.32s)]
*  battle of the sexes shit is wrong and bad for all of us. It is just not the role. Men and women are [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2823.3199999999997s)]
*  not natural enemies. We are so clearly like yin and yang. We're here for each other. We help each [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2830.2799999999997s)]
*  other. We make each other's lives better. And anytime that people are getting into this like, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2837.56s)]
*  no, it's all men's fault. No, it's all women's fault. I always think like you're just missing [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2842.12s)]
*  the point entirely. But anyway, let's play the clip and then we can discuss a little bit. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2846.12s)]
*  It's a major problem. And you know, Speaker Johnson has been talking about those maybe [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2852.52s)]
*  deadbeat folks that are on Medicaid. And maybe some of those folks are the stay-at-home sons. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2857.08s)]
*  We don't know. But I'll tell you this. Leave it to Gen Z to rebrand laziness and social awkwardness [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2861.56s)]
*  as something cutesy, like a stay-at-home son. They did much the same thing with quiet quitting, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2867.8799999999997s)]
*  where you can go to work and do less. And if you call it quiet quitting, it's somehow better. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2872.8399999999997s)]
*  But Laura, I got to tell you, this is also a big problem when it comes to, I think, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2877.64s)]
*  declining birth rates, people not getting married and having children. You know, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2881.24s)]
*  that's a big problem. They blame it on women. Well, look at what young women have to choose from. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2884.84s)]
*  The pickings are slim. Yes, we might have a feminism problem in America, but it's the [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2889.64s)]
*  feminization of men. There are a lot of young women out there that want to get married. They [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2894.52s)]
*  want to have kids. They want to have stable families. But there are a lot of young men out [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2899.32s)]
*  there who want to live in mama's basement and order DoorDash. And therein lies a big part of [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2903.64s)]
*  the problem. It's a major problem. All right. So look, there's a lot here. And there's also, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2908.8399999999997s)]
*  of course, a lot of policy that has to do with this outcome. I will say it is hard to not like [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2917.96s)]
*  the kind of lack of self-awareness from someone like Tommy Lauren, who, like, let's just, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2926.6s)]
*  you know, like I said to you before, like, I've never thought she was, like, particularly good [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2933.64s)]
*  looking or whatever. But, like, she's an attractive woman. She's where she is because of her looks. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2938.6s)]
*  Like, I don't think that's, like, an out of line thing to say. Tommy Lauren, it was never like, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2944.04s)]
*  Whoa, the depth of knowledge that Tommy Lauren brings to a discussion is just why in her 20s, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2948.68s)]
*  she was like a successful millionaire. It's like you were like, you played that game, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2955.4s)]
*  you got lots of doors open to you because you were a young, attractive woman. Now she's a woman in [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2961.2400000000002s)]
*  her 30s who does not have kids and is talking about the problem with plummeting birth rates, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2967.88s)]
*  and then blaming others for it. And I will say that I think part of the reason, and we get into [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2974.76s)]
*  some of the more substantive, like, policy stuff, but part of the reason why stuff like this is [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2981.32s)]
*  infuriating to men in general is, number one, it's what she's saying is actually not true. And [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2985.96s)]
*  there's a bunch of social science on this. It's men actually are more likely, young men are more [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2991.7200000000003s)]
*  likely to want to get married and settle down than young women for whatever reason these days. I was [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=2997.0s)]
*  surprised by that myself. But this is a thing that I think almost everyone, I think every guy knows [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3001.48s)]
*  this. And I think most women who are honest or have a little bit of wisdom and a little bit of [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3010.84s)]
*  experience in life know this too. It simply is not the case that there are slim pickings or there are [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3018.1200000000003s)]
*  no good men who want to settle down. The issue is that Tommy Lauren doesn't want any of those men. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3027.2400000000002s)]
*  Every woman has guys who are in the friend zone who would be really good to you. But what happens [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3034.92s)]
*  to a lot of women is that they just have higher expectations than that. And they're like, no, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3043.08s)]
*  I don't want that guy. I want the guy who is X, Y, and Z. You want this guy who's a top 1% or guy. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3046.44s)]
*  And like, okay, that's fine to want that. But then the question might be, well, look, I mean, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3054.12s)]
*  what are you bringing to the table? Because the thing about the guy who you want who's at the very [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3060.2s)]
*  top is that that guy has options. That guy's got lots of options. And so maybe you're not bringing [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3065.56s)]
*  anything to the table that makes that guy want to marry you. But the truth is that I just do not [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3070.3599999999997s)]
*  believe that Tommy Lauren over the last 10, 15 years has not had lots of decent guys who would [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3074.8399999999997s)]
*  have loved to be committed to her. And so I'm just saying if you want to talk about plummeting birth [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3081.48s)]
*  rates, if you want to talk about the feminization of men or whatever, it's like, is there ever a [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3087.48s)]
*  conversation that should happen about the unrealistic standards of women? Because I got to say, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3094.2s)]
*  I think that's a part of this dynamic. I'm not saying that that's all of it. But it's like, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3100.28s)]
*  no, the truth is that if you're not shallow and materialistic, it's unbelievable, by the way, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3106.12s)]
*  they have, there's the Whatever podcast and the Fresh and Fit podcast. They both blown up because [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3113.9599999999996s)]
*  they do a lot of this content like this type of stuff. But I will say, now, neither of those shows [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3120.6s)]
*  are my thing. But there is something interesting that they've become so big. And one thing that [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3126.3599999999997s)]
*  I've seen, because I've seen some of the clips, it is when they'll interview these young women [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3132.7599999999998s)]
*  and they ask them what they want in a guy, and they just start describing all of the [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3139.48s)]
*  characteristics. And then they'll tell them what percentage of society fits those cats, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3143.8s)]
*  you know, like, so just be like, Well, I want a guy who's like six foot tall. And you know, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3148.6s)]
*  I'd like him to be a good looking guy. I'd like him to be a funny guy. It's important that he [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3152.76s)]
*  makes at least six figures. It's important that he blow and like the list all these things. And [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3157.56s)]
*  you're like, Yeah, that's point oh 3% of men fall into that. So you are now So yes, it's true that [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3161.56s)]
*  if you're only interested in the top point oh 3% of men, it's slim pickings. Yes, but like, okay, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3168.36s)]
*  that's true for everybody. That's true for men too. If men were like, I'll only date a supermodel. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3176.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of hard to find. But if you have more realistic standards, it's just not I don't [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3182.6800000000003s)]
*  believe it's the case that like, it's impossible to find a decent person. I just don't buy that. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3189.48s)]
*  Today's show is sponsored by better help. As I've told you guys before, I personally have [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3194.3599999999997s)]
*  benefited from therapy in the past. And I know a lot of people who have benefited from it are [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3199.24s)]
*  currently still benefiting for it. If you're on the fence about maybe starting therapy, give better [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3203.24s)]

*  any thoughts on any of this Rob? Because we could get into some of the more actual [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3245.08s)]
*  substantive stuff about why it might be that young men are living in their mother's basement. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3248.68s)]
*  Well, in defense, it's stay at home and live in the basement men. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3254.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, you live on your own. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3260.92s)]
*  I do now. I didn't always. But I will say that I think for most of those people, [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3262.7599999999998s)]
*  they're currently being a loser. And I don't think they like that. I don't think that's what [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3270.12s)]
*  they're looking for. I think some of them might have even settled into the lifestyle. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3273.88s)]
*  You might have the rare, autistic one that really loves his video games and wasn't going to get a [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3277.96s)]
*  job. But I'm going to guess by and large, most of those men, if there was a clear path towards [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3282.52s)]
*  a job and pursuing a family and all those things, I bet that they would like that. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3289.7200000000003s)]
*  And I bet some of those people are even currently looking for jobs. And I think as a young man, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3297.2400000000002s)]
*  it takes some time to get it together. I was a loser for a long time. And sometimes there just [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3303.08s)]
*  aren't job opportunities right out of the gate. And you kind of settle into that there aren't job [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3307.7999999999997s)]
*  opportunities right out of the gate. I don't think most of the young men you're describing [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3311.88s)]
*  left college and when this is my dream to go move back home and then we're at home and started [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3316.2799999999997s)]
*  ordering. I bet if you spoke to most of those men, they enjoy the time when they're drinking [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3323.24s)]
*  or the couple times that they're out with their friends playing video games. But I'm guessing by [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3328.2799999999997s)]
*  and large they haven't gone, hey, this is the life and I hope that this is what I'm doing forever. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3331.8s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, it's not that there's nothing to her point. There has been a feminization of [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3336.36s)]
*  men. I don't think that's good for men or women. I it's clearly a part of it. Well, I don't drink [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3342.92s)]
*  no fluoride. And look at me. I'm pure plastic, baby. Yeah, there you go. Plastic particles. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3349.4s)]
*  And look at us just poster boys of pure masculinity. But like, so I'm not saying [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3353.6400000000003s)]
*  there's nothing to that. But I do agree with you. I think by and large, like, I don't think too many [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3361.48s)]
*  people want to be adults who are living in their mom's basement. I think that it is more born out [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3367.0s)]
*  of financial necessity. And it's not a coincidence that when we lived in a society where a guy could [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3373.96s)]
*  just go wait online and get a job at a factory, and that job could support a family, that that's [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3380.28s)]
*  what they went and did. And there are opportunities like that as readily available. And so now that's [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3387.8s)]
*  not what people are doing. I think that obviously, there's been there's been government policies [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3393.48s)]
*  that have drastically driven up the price of education, the price of real estate, the price of [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3401.0800000000004s)]
*  health insurance, the price of you know, like all of the things that you'd need to be able to afford [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3411.0800000000004s)]
*  in order to support a family. And, you know, I also think that through laws, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3416.76s)]
*  we've made marriage a much less desirable situation for a man to be in than it otherwise would be. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3430.0400000000004s)]
*  And for, you know, for many, many generations, for probably hundreds, if not thousands of years, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3439.4s)]
*  essentially, for better or worse, I'm not saying this is perfect. But the way that society kind of [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3451.48s)]
*  channeled men into marriage was through a series of incentives. And a lot of them were sexual, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3457.88s)]
*  but not all of them. But in general, for a very long period of time, out of wedlock sex was very [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3468.84s)]
*  demonized and stigmatized. And this was the idea was for men, if you want to get laid, you got to [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3476.52s)]
*  commit to a woman. And I will say, when you're talking about young men, you're talking about men [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3483.48s)]
*  in their 20s, channeling there, if you want to get laid, you have to do these steps, you can get men [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3487.8s)]
*  to run through walls, you know what I mean? You can get a lot from young men if you channel this [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3493.4s)]
*  is how you go about getting sex. On top of that, the reward for men after getting married would be [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3497.64s)]
*  that you get to be the man. You're the man of the house, father knows best, you will be the leader, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3505.32s)]
*  these are the type of incentives that men respond to. Almost every guy wants to be the man, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3512.44s)]
*  to some degree, in his own little realm. And we kind of one by one stripped all of these incentives [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3519.64s)]
*  away. Like, now men are in a situation where like, particularly, by the way, the men who Tommy Lauren [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3527.32s)]
*  is going to be interested in, because you can already tell, like, by the nature of her complaint, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3533.4s)]
*  that it's like, you're picky about who you want to be with, which is fine. I'm not saying you can't [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3537.88s)]
*  be. I'm just saying there's reality. And now, you know, for those women who are going after the 0.03 [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3541.8s)]
*  of men, when you're going after them, it's like, those guys have tons of options, and they don't [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3549.1600000000003s)]
*  have to get married to get laid. They could just get laid all the time. Now, right away, look, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3555.2400000000002s)]
*  you're just fucking with the incentives of young men. Because now right away, the sexual incentive [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3561.4s)]
*  is no longer to get married and settle down. The sexual incentive is like, don't get married and [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3567.72s)]
*  settle down. Now you can play the field and have sex with lots of girls. And like, that's what men [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3572.12s)]
*  are biologically wired to do. And so it's just like a bad... But then on top of that, I mean, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3578.2s)]
*  the financial... You know, there was one clip I saw where Andrew Schultz had a divorce lawyer on. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3583.08s)]
*  And the way he said it, I thought was actually very reasonable. So he was like, he goes, look, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3590.04s)]
*  in if you look at marriage as a contract, right? Like most marriages that I know, he said something [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3595.88s)]
*  along those lines, I might not get it exactly right. But he basically said that, like, okay, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3602.84s)]
*  so like, there'll be, let's say you have like a marriage. And so the deal is essentially that [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3606.12s)]
*  it's like, the guy's like, okay, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go work and make money to like support our [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3611.7200000000003s)]
*  family having a nice lifestyle. And like, you're going to like, you know, bear children, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3617.64s)]
*  deliver children, you know, you're gonna be a mother, you're gonna, you know, whatever, we're [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3625.08s)]
*  gonna have sex, we're gonna, you're gonna cook or clean or whatever. I'm not saying like, it has to [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3631.08s)]
*  be like the strictest traditional marriage, but like, more or less, this is kind of the deal. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3636.2799999999997s)]
*  But the contract of marriage is only enforceable on one end. Like, the man is responsible to [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3641.7999999999997s)]
*  fulfill his obligation, even if the contract is void, even if the marriage is off, and the woman [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3648.2s)]
*  is not at all. There's no, she does not, if you get divorced, you have to continue to financially [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3653.3999999999996s)]
*  support her. But she doesn't have to continue to be nice to you or have sex with you, or even be the [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3659.72s)]
*  type of mother that you want her to be or any of that. So you like created this situation where [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3664.68s)]
*  it's a big risk for men, you know, particularly if the type of men that someone like Tommy Lauren's [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3670.2s)]
*  going to be into is probably like a dude who's got some money. And then there's like, it's a [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3675.3999999999996s)]
*  huge financial risk now. So I just don't like, if you want to just sit here and demonize men, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3679.56s)]
*  like all men are shit. It's like, you know, human beings are fucked up creatures. And so we're all, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3685.08s)]
*  we're all a mess, you know. And because of that, it's easy to demonize men or demonize women, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3692.2s)]
*  you know, it's like, you could always find the character flaws in people and then be like, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3698.44s)]
*  yeah, look at them, they're terrible. But, you know, all those things considered and the fact [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3703.48s)]
*  that we're all mess, there's just lots of, there's lots of good people out there. There's lots of [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3708.6s)]
*  good people who would treat someone right, would be a nice person to like start a life with. And [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3712.28s)]
*  this type of energy is just fucking toxic. And again, it's like, it's, like, we say this a lot, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3717.16s)]
*  but it's almost like with anything else, if you're going, you know, if you're a comedian, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3725.0s)]
*  and you go on stage all the time, and you're never getting laughs, and you're like, man, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3730.6s)]
*  all the crowds are terrible. That's like, that's convenient, you know, and to see Laura Ingram and [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3734.28s)]
*  Tommy Lauren, like these two unmarried childless women sitting here and bitching about men, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3740.28s)]
*  it's like, that's also pretty goddamn convenient, pretty goddamn convenient that the problem is [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3746.2s)]
*  everything except you. You know, just a thought. All right, we're going to wrap up there. Thank [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3751.24s)]
*  you guys very much for tuning in. Catch you tomorrow. Peace. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_nrCZvcQEY&t=3756.6s)]
