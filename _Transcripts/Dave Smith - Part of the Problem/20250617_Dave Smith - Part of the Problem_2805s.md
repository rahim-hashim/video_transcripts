# Dave Smith | Trump and Iran w/ Scott Horton | Part Of The Problem 1276
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs)
*  What's up, what's up everybody. Welcome to a brand new episode of part of the problem [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=0.0s)]
*  very quickly. Before we get started, just a quick reminder this weekend, I will be right [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=11.6s)]
*  here in New Jersey at the dojo of comedy that shows a Friday and Saturday night. So come [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=16.52s)]
*  on out, hope to see some of you guys there. All right. For those of you guys who've been [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  paying attention, I've been in, as some of you know, I self deported from MAGA yesterday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=26.42s)]
*  And I've been, we've been in quite a storm, as I refer to them, when there are these kind [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=34.74s)]
*  of, when there are new events, quite often it's a new war. But when there are these new [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=41.22s)]
*  events, you kind of catch yourself in like this storm of propaganda. And everybody's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=46.78s)]
*  going crazy. And in these moments, you do the only thing you can do, which is you call [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=50.8s)]
*  Scott Horton and you ask him to do your show tomorrow. It's really the only way to handle [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=56.8s)]
*  these things I've found. And of course the great Scott Horton was good enough to join [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  us from pork fest in New Hampshire there. So forgive the, the not in a studio setup, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=66.08s)]
*  but Scott, thank you so much for taking the time. Of course you guys all know Scott Horton. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=75.32s)]
*  He's the most frequent guest on the show and he's the author of, of Fools Aaron enough [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=79.04s)]
*  already provoked. Also the host of the Scott Horton show and he's over at antiwar.com and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  the founder of the Libertarian Institute. What a time, what a time to be alive, Scott, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  pretty wild. I, I'm almost wondering where exactly to start with this. So let's start [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=97.68s)]
*  developments, which are pretty bizarre. Last night, Donald Trump sent the most ominous [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=104.26s)]
*  message that I've ever seen a president send where he called for the evacuation of Tehran. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  He also had another tweet where he talked about how bad the death and destruction was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  about to be. It really seemed like it was going down last night. It didn't. It seemed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  like Trump thought it was going to go down last night. I don't know if somebody was able [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=128.28s)]
*  to delay it or stop it or what, but what do you make of that comment? And where do you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=133.26s)]
*  think we are right now? I mean, it's just atrocious. It's absolute terrorism. I mean, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=138.06s)]
*  it's unbelievable that he would say that. And, and of course, if, if the subject is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=148.06s)]
*  the critical nuclear infrastructure of the country, none of that is in Tehran. There [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=154.82s)]
*  are plenty of government targets in Tehran, of course. But if we're talking about satellite [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=160.9s)]
*  guided munitions on government buildings, you don't need to evacuate the entire city [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=165.78s)]
*  for that. So the implication there was like up to and including carpet bombing with B-52s [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  or, you know, even potentially atom bombs. I'm not saying that's what I think he meant [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=179.98s)]
*  by it, but I mean, evacuate the entire capital city of the country, a city of millions of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=184.74s)]
*  people. I don't know the exact number I've heard people say 10 million people. And I [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  mean, it's just unbelievable. And, and what he could have possibly, what he had in mind [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=195.66s)]
*  there, like, who knows? Like, quite frankly, he might've just meant by that, that, that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=201.66000000000003s)]
*  Israel still has the same green light that they have had for the past few days and that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  they're going to continue to hit government targets. Right? Like he might've not meant [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=212.26s)]
*  anything by it other than that the same war is going to continue essentially. Or he might've [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=216.9s)]
*  meant that I'm sending in the heavy bombers and I'm going to wipe your capital city off [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=222.1s)]
*  the face of the earth. And anything in between there, Dave? I mean, for Christ's sake, this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=226.9s)]
*  is the President of the United States of America talking this way. It's just unbelievable that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  this is what's happening. And I, despite everything, I tend to be a minimalist on even the worst [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=236.98s)]
*  stuff because the most alarmist take is usually not what happens, right? Like he's not going [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  to drop an H bomb on Tehran. He's not going to send it beef. He's just carpet bomb the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  neighborhoods, right? He's going to do like, you know, Winston Churchill style saturation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  bombing. Why would he do that? He's not going to do that. There's no reason in the world [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=261.26s)]
*  to do that. So not that there's good reason behind any of this stuff, but I, but the fact [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=265.22s)]
*  that he would even talk that way is unbelievable. I would say that, you know, I did, you know, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  I had heard what I thought were credible enough statements from people who know things that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  we had antiwar.com announced that as I had said on Sunday, I had heard that it could [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  start as soon as Monday and that America was getting into the war. And that was not like [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  a valve. Oh, my great prediction or whatever is me telling you the bad news that I have [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=294.06s)]
*  heard from people who I thought it was worth repeating that this is what's being talked [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=299.14000000000004s)]
*  about is that America is going to really get in full scale here. And I sure hope that my [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  sources were wrong. And I saw where Steve Bannon actually on a getter had quoted Dave [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=308.66s)]
*  DeCamp's news article about my statement there and said that this was coming from the Israelis, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=315.82s)]
*  which according to him, the Israelis were going around Washington saying the same thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=320.94s)]
*  That may be true, but that's not who my sources were. And that's for sure not where my sources [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=325.74s)]
*  were getting their information from whatsoever. So, but the point is that it so far has not [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=330.78s)]
*  happened. And in that same article, we say at antiwar.com, everyone call the White House, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=337.94s)]
*  please do whatever you can call them, email them, repeatedly, do it over and over again, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=342.3s)]
*  get all your friends and family to do it. It matters a lot whether just the word is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=346.54s)]
*  in the White House that people are going crazy over this and hate it or not or worse, the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  opposite. If people are really rallying behind it, he's got to know it isn't just Tucker [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  Carlson and Dave Smith. It's huge factions of his supporters. This is their absolute [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=363.66s)]
*  line. They will never support him again over this. This is an absolute breakup done deal [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=370.66s)]
*  kind of thing that he absolutely cannot go further and should, you know, he's saying [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=375.1s)]
*  he wants peace. He's saying he wants to stop fighting. Well, he's the one sending all the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  bombs and telling Netanyahu that he has permission to break all of the international law and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=382.82000000000005s)]
*  go right ahead and will protect him in that. So he's the one who could, you know, end it [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  with a phone call right now. But, but I don't know what's going to happen. I do know that [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  I saw assuming this is real. I really don't know. I guess I should not mention unless [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=398.98s)]
*  I know that this is true. But I guess I could just say there are indications of there are [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=404.06s)]
*  strong indications for many sources, regardless of the video I saw this morning, that the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=408.42s)]
*  Israeli have essentially total air dominance over at least major parts of Western Iran, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=413.1s)]
*  if not the whole country where they're just they have at will. They can go wherever they [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=418.42s)]
*  want. There's the whatever F-4s and F-14s they ever had in reserve are not flying if [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  they are even possible to fly at this point from the Nixon and Ford years that they had [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=430.22s)]
*  stockpiled up then. But and I don't know how many missiles they got left, but their ultimate [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=437.38s)]
*  threat that they would decimate American resources in the Gulf and hold America ultimately responsible [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=442.94s)]
*  for any major attack by Israel like this has not come to pass. I guess they're probably [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=448.1s)]
*  terrified of what Trump would do if they would go that far, although they should have been [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=453.42s)]
*  just as afraid of George Bush. Perhaps that was always just a bluff, but that was their [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=456.34s)]
*  deterrent was this medium range ballistic missile force. But then again, how might America [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=460.9s)]
*  react if they really decimated or even made a good try at killing our guys in Kuwait, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=467.46s)]
*  in Qatar and Bahrain, at these major naval and air bases there and army bases? They could [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=473.73999999999995s)]
*  get nuked over something like that. If they hit back that hard and we were unable to stop it, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=481.86s)]
*  at least it could escalate. Never mind nukes, but it could escalate into a much worse war [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=486.74s)]
*  than the one that they're already in now. And then of course, security in Iran is a government [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=493.94s)]
*  program, Dave. And so of course, they're the keystone cops over there. Once they lost a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=499.3s)]
*  little bit of, I don't know exactly how many anti-aircraft missiles they lost last October [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=503.58000000000004s)]
*  in the Israeli raids then, but they essentially were helpless before this thing. They're not [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=510.46s)]
*  organized to do anything about it. I hadn't heard a thing, and I'm sorry to say I'm a bit out of touch, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=515.54s)]
*  but I hadn't heard a thing about what their Navy's doing, just sitting in port. Or if the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=518.86s)]
*  Israelis are even targeting it, they're just going to sit this one out because what the hell [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=524.1s)]
*  are they going to do? I don't know. But then again, in the scheme of things, Iran of course, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=527.86s)]
*  is much more powerful than Iraq, Libya, Syria were. And their bluff always was that they would [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=535.22s)]
*  find ways to hit back. But of course, that included things like activating Hezbollah to launch other [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=543.46s)]
*  missiles that Israel, well, that's already a spent force. Assad is already gone. Nasrallah's dead. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=548.4200000000001s)]
*  They said, I'm sure you saw this, that they say that Netanyahu wanted to kill the Ayatollah, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=555.62s)]
*  but Donald Trump talked him out of it. But that's of course still on the table, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=560.1s)]
*  if they know where he is, which they probably do. By the way, the last I saw, they have not [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=564.42s)]
*  completely destroyed Natanz and Fordow. And perhaps they mean to potentially protect that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=569.78s)]
*  nuclear material. They could inflict enough destruction on Iran's military force. Perhaps [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=578.0999999999999s)]
*  they intend to send ground forces in there to destroy those centrifuges and get nuclear [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=584.66s)]
*  material out of there rather than just bombing it. They have hit a lot of facilities at Natanz [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=590.26s)]
*  and at Ishafane and at Boucher, I believe I saw. Not sure. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So all of those already, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=597.46s)]
*  but on the other hand, I don't think that I've read that they've made a significant attempt [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=604.74s)]
*  to actually collapse and or otherwise destroy entirely the underground facilities at Natanz [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=610.26s)]
*  and at Fordow where the centrifuges actually are. So I'm not sure about that stage. But as they have [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=617.54s)]
*  said, they expect this thing to take at least weeks. And I don't know if there's really an [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=624.0999999999999s)]
*  Iranian army, Air Force, Navy, Special Operations Forces of whatever kind, the Quds Force and RGC [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=630.42s)]
*  prepared to respond in any significant way at this point, or that was it. They had their missiles [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=637.3s)]
*  and that was their bluff. They fired most of what they can. I hear other people saying, oh no, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=641.78s)]
*  they're completely dominating these roads. They have, I know, got a lot of hits in on Israel, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=646.74s)]
*  have overwhelmed their defensive missile forces. I don't know for how long they can sustain that, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=652.1800000000001s)]
*  maybe for longer than anyone expects. I try again, even in the worst of things, I try not to be [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=657.86s)]
*  worst case scenario about any of this stuff on either side either, but just, you know what I mean, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=666.66s)]
*  like the most extensive claims of casualties or the most extensive claims of destruction [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=671.7s)]
*  or of consequences are usually not what come to pass. But then again, we've also seen like in a [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=676.18s)]
*  Rock War II, God dang, that thing turned into an absolutely catastrophic eight year civil war and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=683.3s)]
*  a million people killed and whatever far beyond what even the worst Brits expected before it [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  happened. And I knew people who were saying, hey, there's going to be a sectarian war in that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=696.3399999999999s)]
*  country. They still didn't think it was going to be that bad, you know, where America was going to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=700.9s)]
*  help the Shiites cleanse every last Sunni or almost virtually all the Sunnis out of Baghdad and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=704.9s)]
*  all the predominantly Shiite areas and create a new Shia stand the way they did and all of that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=710.42s)]
*  But anyway, so it's still early days. I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=715.3s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's, I mean, I think that's the responsible take on all of it. Do you think, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=719.22s)]
*  so because I want to get into kind of like the politics of all of it in a second, but obviously [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=727.14s)]
*  look, as you said, Iran is a different situation and they're the fact that they've hit Israel at [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=732.42s)]
*  all and killed some Israelis kind of demonstrates that this is different than Iraq or Libya or Syria [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=739.3s)]
*  or Yemen or these countries that simply just didn't have the capabilities to do that. Now, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=745.4599999999999s)]
*  one of the arguments that the Hawks have made for a long time, and I'm trying to be charitable here [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=750.1s)]
*  because I think that this this might be the case and maybe I just don't know enough to know whether [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=755.6999999999999s)]
*  this is right or not, but the claim has been in a lot of ways that Iran is actually a much better [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=760.98s)]
*  candidate for regime change and that Iran certainly does have, it's a more sophisticated [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=768.02s)]
*  country. It has more of a history of something like liberalism. Under the shawl, you can see [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=775.38s)]
*  pictures of women in mini skirts and stuff in the big cities. And I know that there is still like [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=781.46s)]
*  an underground world in Iran, in Tehran, for example, there are like nightclubs and stuff [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=786.98s)]
*  where girls go and like you're not allowed to do it, but they take off the hijabs or whatever and [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=793.3s)]
*  go down. But like, do you think there's any possibility that maybe because it seems to me [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=799.14s)]
*  that this is clearly a regime change war, you know, even Netanyahu himself in his interview with [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=804.66s)]
*  Brett Bayer said that he they had some intelligence that Iran could have been a year away from a [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=808.9s)]
*  nuclear weapon, but it seems to me like it's pretty obviously the case that Israel thought [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=814.18s)]
*  this was their opportunity to do it. Like, as you mentioned with Hezbollah being weakened and Assad [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=822.42s)]
*  out of the picture, that this was their moment where they could get this regime change. If that's [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=826.9799999999999s)]
*  the case, do you think there's a chance that maybe they can neutralize, you know, Iran's ability to [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=831.9399999999999s)]
*  launch missiles at our bases and at Israel and a regime change here wouldn't necessarily be [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=837.38s)]
*  the disaster that it was in all of the previous ones? What do you think about that? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=842.66s)]
*  All right, well, all right, so I'll get back to the nuclear question because you brought that up [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=850.18s)]
*  in there. But that's a couple of different answers to go into. But just as far as the population, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=854.1s)]
*  they're not liking their government, of course, this is what they said about Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=859.86s)]
*  And of course, it was true that in Afghanistan and Iraq, there were a lot of people who didn't [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=864.18s)]
*  want to live under the Taliban. And there were a lot of people who didn't want to live under Saddam [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=867.62s)]
*  Hussein. In Iraq, the supermajority, in fact, was very happy to stand aside and let Bush invade and [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=870.66s)]
*  then take them all the way to Baghdad. That was what led to the civil war that I just described [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=877.6999999999999s)]
*  that killed a million people when, you know, even John Stewart fell for the big purple-fingered [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=882.26s)]
*  election of January 2005. Oh, my goodness, everyone look, democracy. But democracy is just two wolves [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=887.6999999999999s)]
*  than a lamb, right? Democracy is just only majority rule unless you already have all of these [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=894.5s)]
*  principles of liberty and respect for minority rights and religious, you know, sectarian differences [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=903.38s)]
*  and every other thing. Instead, all you had was America touching off a gigantic war by solving [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=909.38s)]
*  those people's problems. Then in Libya, they said, oh, you know what we're going to do here? We're [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=916.66s)]
*  going to do the lighter touch and we're going to do a regime change, but we're just going to back [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=920.02s)]
*  al-Qaeda forces on the ground there. But we're not going to do a big occupation like George W. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=924.9s)]
*  Bush. That's where he screwed up Iraq, is he should have just, you know, had done the regime change, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=929.9399999999999s)]
*  but then let them work it out. But then that led to a giant 10-year civil war in Libya, too, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=935.54s)]
*  and still some fighting. It's not like the whole country is in total chaos. But there's certainly [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=940.98s)]
*  no such thing as Libya anymore. There's Tripoli and Benghazi are the two capitals of warring [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=946.5s)]
*  factions in the South. Last I read about it, you know, a couple of years ago was essentially lawless [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=951.46s)]
*  or, you know, under various tribal clans and whatever. So the United Nations state of Libya [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=958.02s)]
*  created after World War II, by the way, not after World War I even, but had been two or three [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=963.22s)]
*  kingdoms back then and no longer exist. And of course, as everyone knows, and this wasn't just [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=967.86s)]
*  a scandal from 2011 and 12, this is ongoing this whole time still, literal chattel slavery of black [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=973.06s)]
*  Africans, Sub-Saharan Africans in Libya. They can be bought and sold for $400 on the market there. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=979.78s)]
*  This is what America did to Libya. So there's your heavy hand and there's your light touch regime [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=986.02s)]
*  change. Then in Syria, it was all supposedly covert, although overt action, where America [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=991.3s)]
*  supported bin Ladenite forces on the ground and led to the rise of the caliphate. We had to launch [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=997.78s)]
*  a whole Iraq War three to destroy the caliphate that we built. Oops, we be in Barack Obama. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1003.9399999999999s)]
*  And then that's the war that Trump finished up in his first term. Now, whose side are we on taking [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1009.62s)]
*  on the ayatollah here, Dave? Again, Osama bin Laden side is who and whatever's left of Al-Qaeda, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1015.4599999999999s)]
*  which there is, you know, still remnants of Al-Qaeda networks in the world, you know, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1021.06s)]
*  they all have the same essentially Islamist ideology. The question is whether they'd agreed [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1026.74s)]
*  with bin Laden's politics about whether to target Americans or not, but they're all still the same [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1032.1s)]
*  suicide bomber, head shopper maniacs in the bin Ladenite mold anyway. And those guys and the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1037.14s)]
*  Islamic state in various factions still exist. And probably at the behest of some intelligence [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1042.9s)]
*  agencies, maybe some friendly, maybe some not, always suspect the Saudis first. And they're [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1049.86s)]
*  always, of course, joined at the hip with the CIA when it comes to stuff like that. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1054.5s)]
*  And I would expect them to benefit greatly from regime change in Iran. I mean, if they kill the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1058.5s)]
*  ayatollah and the mullahs and whatever succeed in essentially decimating the regime, I think [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1063.94s)]
*  everybody's going to break out of friendship and like whatever the liberals in Tehran who watch CNN [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1069.7s)]
*  are going to take over the country and everything's going to be rad after that. And [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1074.82s)]
*  all the Azeris and all the Sunni Arabs and all the Shiite Persians and all the different [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1078.42s)]
*  factions there, they're all going to get along. Once all of the chaotic violence that we're [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1083.86s)]
*  raining down on them is wrapped up. Yeah, probably not. I tend to doubt that. And that's not to say [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1090.02s)]
*  that everyone there loves their government. I don't know why anyone would love their government. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1098.6599999999999s)]
*  In their case, they're under a Shiite theocracy, which I would presume probably most Shiites don't [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1102.8999999999999s)]
*  even want their government to be run by their religious leaders. I don't know. I'm not speaking [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1108.82s)]
*  for them. But if you showed me some saying that they don't like theocracy, I would not be surprised [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1114.5s)]
*  by that. But you remember George W. Bush got a 90 something, 91% approval rating or 89 or something. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1120.6599999999999s)]
*  Maybe 91 was instead 89% approval rating for September 11th happening to us on his watch, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1129.78s)]
*  because simply the idea was that no, it's us versus the world. Nobody messes with us and us [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1136.5s)]
*  is us and we're all united together. And America supports our political leadership in marshaling [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1141.22s)]
*  our violent force to hurt anyone who dares to hurt any of our people. That's how we felt about it [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1149.62s)]
*  at Georgetown University. They call it the rally around the flag effect. Yeah. Well, what do you [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1155.14s)]
*  think is going to happen? You carpet bomb people. You know, there's a guy that I interviewed in [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1160.66s)]
*  Yemen for years. I still, in fact, I was supposed to interview him recently, but our plans fell [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1164.26s)]
*  through. Nasser Arbi, this great reporter from Sanat. And he told me essentially paraphrasing, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1168.98s)]
*  we're all Houthis now, pal, right? Not that they are at all. The Houthis are the Shiite sect from [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1175.22s)]
*  the North that used to rule the country back, you know, in the ages and whatever, but haven't [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1180.58s)]
*  been in power a very long time. But once they took over the country, Barack Obama first worked with [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1184.9s)]
*  them to kill Al Qaeda guys, but then quickly stabbed them in the back in March of 2015 and [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1190.42s)]
*  started bombing them. And so essentially every Yemeni patriot rallied around the government [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1194.8200000000002s)]
*  that at that time now happened to be run by the Houthis. As he put it to me, he said to me, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1201.78s)]
*  it's just like when George W. Bush, he comes from Texas, but when he's the president of the country, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1207.22s)]
*  he's the president of the whole country. Doesn't mean that the Texans are representatives of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1212.5s)]
*  everybody all the time, but they are when George W. Bush is the president and something happens, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1216.66s)]
*  then in that case, we're all with this guy because he's the leader. It's the same thing [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1221.38s)]
*  for the Houthis. And I would suspect it's the same thing for the Ayatollah now, at least to a great [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1226.5s)]
*  degree. And I think it's crazy to see the Israelis just openly palling around with the monarchists, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1230.74s)]
*  with the Pahlavi family saying that that's what we're doing here. That's what I'm hearing. Is [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1237.78s)]
*  that what Donald Trump's speech in Qatar was all about when he said that we don't care about [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1242.82s)]
*  spreading democracy anymore? Is what he was saying was, well, we're just going to reinstall a monarch, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1247.78s)]
*  so we don't want to come off sounding like Robert Kagan first and getting ourselves into that trap. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1252.58s)]
*  I don't know what, man. What a trip. I don't know. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1258.4199999999998s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, which is Proton Mail. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1260.98s)]
*  Proton Mail is an email service run by Proton that will replace your Gmail account for all [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1265.62s)]
*  of your important stuff so that you can have a more secure emailing experience. It's also a great [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1271.7s)]
*  way to start over. All of our emails are flooded with junk at this point. So get a clean start with [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1276.82s)]
*  Proton and know that you'll have a more secure experience going forward. Proton will always have [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1282.26s)]
*  a freemium version and you can later change to a paid product if you're convinced about the product. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1286.74s)]
*  But you can create an account right now for free. It does all the stuff that Gmail does. It's just [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1291.78s)]
*  more secure. Proton Mail, go create an account today. All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1297.54s)]
*  Ask me about the nuclear if you want. Yeah, yeah. Well, I was going to, we'll get into [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1302.34s)]
*  some of that stuff if we have time. Our mutual friend, Darrell Cooper, had a great post on Twitter [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1307.22s)]
*  last night when he was really saying that, you know, you see Donald Trump siding with the Never [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1314.5s)]
*  Trump neocons after delivering this amazing speech in the Middle East where he just blasted all of [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1320.42s)]
*  them in their entire worldview. It's just, it's truly pathetic. I mean, it's like one of the, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1325.54s)]
*  it's more embarrassing than senile Joe Biden being our president, is Donald Trump just totally [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1332.34s)]
*  cucking to the elements that have been working against him his entire political career. Okay, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1338.98s)]
*  maybe we'll get into the politics if we have time. But I do want to talk, yeah, we should, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1346.18s)]
*  I should get you to talk a bit about the nuclear threat. Maybe this will be a good [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1350.5s)]
*  launching off point for you. Because Donald Trump really had a brilliant response the other day. I [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1355.22s)]
*  don't know if you saw this clip. But so he said, you know, as he likes to say in his big, beautiful [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1360.66s)]
*  capital letters, Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. And then one of the reporters [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1365.94s)]
*  pointed out that your own director of national intelligence released the annual threat assessment [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1371.46s)]
*  a couple months ago, saying that nothing's changed there. And that there, yes, they have a [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1376.58s)]
*  latent nuclear deterrent, but they've enriched uranium beyond the medical need of whatever, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1382.8999999999999s)]
*  20% or something, they're up to about 60%. But they have no ambition of getting a nuclear weapon, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1389.54s)]
*  and they're not attempting to get one. And Donald Trump responded by saying, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1394.1s)]
*  Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. So I thought that was a really brilliant [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1399.3s)]
*  comeback. I don't know why Tulsi Gabbard hasn't resigned already. But anyway, what exactly is [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1405.86s)]
*  this this phony Iranian nuclear threat? Yeah, I mean, and this is just absolutely outrageous. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1413.78s)]
*  There's nothing has changed at all. And so for Trump to pretend that anything has changed here, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1421.94s)]
*  other than that him and Netanyahu agreed that they wanted to start a war now is just a damn lie. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1427.3s)]
*  And his implication there is a lie. As you say, his statement is so paper thin, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1431.94s)]
*  you can't even find the direct lie in it. Other than what's it's just like when you deal with [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1438.42s)]
*  W. Bush, she's a kind of sounded like what he was trying to say was, Dave, that, well, they're, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1444.26s)]
*  they were making a nuclear bomb, and I had to stop them before they finished. Right? That must be [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1450.26s)]
*  what he meant. And then that's what we're supposed to take from that. That's what your mom and dad [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1455.46s)]
*  are supposed to think he said. But that's not right. That's not right at all. And it's the same [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1459.7s)]
*  kind of thing that W. Bush would say, you know, about September 11, they go, why we got to attack [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1465.22s)]
*  Iraq, because it's September 11. And two and a three and a four and a seven and eight. And then [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1469.54s)]
*  you go, because we learned that data from now on, we got to start all the wars, and you can't just [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1476.66s)]
*  let people attack you and stuff. Like, wait, what it sounded there in that giant pregnant pause. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1481.3s)]
*  Like he was saying we have to attack them because they did September 11. Isn't that what he meant? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1487.94s)]
*  Sounded like what he meant. That's essentially what Trump is doing here. George W. Bush would say, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1492.34s)]
*  well, I shorthanded it. Never anyone call him out. I short Yeah, in other words, he implied a giant [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1497.78s)]
*  lie for you to just kind of understand and infer from his statement. And that's what Trump is doing [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1503.7s)]
*  here. Nothing has changed. Other than is to start a war and Trump let him and he said he gave him a [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1509.8600000000001s)]
*  deadline to agree to end all enrichment. And that deadline expired. Okay, but having enrichment [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1516.9s)]
*  is not making a nuclear bomb at all. Those are two entirely different concepts. Now, in fact, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1525.38s)]
*  they have had enrichment capabilities since the end of 2005, beginning 2006. So then they started [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1531.7s)]
*  spinning their centrifuges at the time, they master the fuel cycle, they enrich up to 3.6%, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1537.46s)]
*  mostly for their civilian nuclear program. And as you said, 20% for targets for their medical [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1542.9s)]
*  isotope reactors. And then the 60% lately is since Trump tore up the deal in 2018. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1548.74s)]
*  Then they did that in order to have a bargaining chip just to negotiate away again is all. And they [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1554.66s)]
*  made that clear this whole time. And not just they've made that clear. Everybody knows that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1560.42s)]
*  The IAEA and all the inspectors and all of the wonks who write about this regularly and whatever, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1565.94s)]
*  everyone understands the deal. And in fact, in the 2016, pardon me, the 2015 deal that [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1571.06s)]
*  Barack Obama signed, there's stipulations in there that if America breaks the deal, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1576.98s)]
*  then Iran can stop abiding by its restrictions in the deal too, without breaking the deal itself. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1581.3s)]
*  And they are still members, not exactly in perfect standing, but yeah, essentially, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1589.22s)]
*  they're still members in good standing with the rest of the Security Council in that deal, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1592.98s)]
*  the JCPOA. Trump didn't really tear it up as much as he just withdrew the United States from it. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1596.1s)]
*  But the problem was he just essentially got himself in this idiotic trap by agreeing and [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1601.94s)]
*  letting the neoconservatives and the hawks dictate this policy, which you might remember, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1607.62s)]
*  they wavered on this a couple of weeks ago and the hawks all freaked out. This is when Mark Levin [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1611.7s)]
*  went to the White House and everything. No enrichment. And Trump had said, ah, maybe there [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1615.54s)]
*  would be some enrichment under some kind of deal. And they said, no enrichment. And then he agreed [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1619.46s)]
*  with that. He backed down from his softening position there. And then as anyone could have [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1623.62s)]
*  told you, the Ayatollah is never backing down on that. They have to keep some centrifuges and at [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1631.3000000000002s)]
*  least a latent nuclear capability. And that is one, their electricity program so they can consume [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1636.5800000000002s)]
*  their domestic sources of uranium, which they have, and sell their oil. And two, show the world that, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1643.6200000000001s)]
*  look, we could make a nuke, but just don't put us in that position. All right? And was essentially [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1650.26s)]
*  what they had, essentially just like Japan, Brazil, and Germany. Everybody knows they can't enrich [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1655.5400000000002s)]
*  but let's not perturb them because you know, well, especially the Germans and the Japanese can get, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1659.78s)]
*  I don't know if anybody's too worried about the Brazilians, but they can make nukes. Don't anybody [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1664.8999999999999s)]
*  mess with Brazil. They can make nukes. All right. Same thing here. And the problem is Trump took [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1668.18s)]
*  Netanyahu's advice, if you want to call it that, and tore up the deal of 2015. Now he's trying to [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1675.62s)]
*  find a way essentially into the exact same deal again, only on a bilateral basis, not the same [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1681.3s)]
*  but he just couldn't give in on enrichment and the Ayatollah wasn't going to give in either. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1689.62s)]
*  But all that meant was we were at an impasse of idiocy. All he had to do was figure out a way to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1695.06s)]
*  back down on that, not tell Israel to now launch an aggressive war because somehow we're supposed [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1700.98s)]
*  to, again, just infer and believe that their continued ability to enrich uranium at all is [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1708.58s)]
*  tantamount to an almost complete nuclear weapons program. And in fact, I don't know if you saw this, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1715.78s)]
*  but today it's on, Dave DeKamp has a piece on antiwar.com about it. There's a thing on CNN [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1721.7s)]
*  about a new intelligence report and I know it's CNN. I don't know exactly what, I mean, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1728.74s)]
*  they're claiming their sources, a new intelligence report that was given to Trump by [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1733.46s)]
*  the intelligence community last week. And I don't know for sure. I'm not certain from here if it's [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1740.02s)]
*  a national intelligence estimate. No, cut out there for a second. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1744.98s)]
*  Okay, Scott cut out there for a second, but while we're waiting to see if we can get him back, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1756.98s)]
*  I think the thing that's really important to understand about the insistence that there's [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1762.42s)]
*  no enrichment is that this is a poison pill. It's intentionally designed to ruin the possibility of [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1769.86s)]
*  negotiations. And so that was the goal the whole time. It's not that they want to stop, they're [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1778.5s)]
*  very concerned about this nuclear threat. If you were very concerned about the nuclear threat, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1785.3s)]
*  what you would want is an inspection regime, which is what they got, a new inspection regime [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1789.78s)]
*  under the deal with Obama that Donald Trump tore up. And so, you know, it's like the, and here, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1794.82s)]
*  let me text Scott right here to see if we can get him back on. But this is what the war hawks [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1801.62s)]
*  are kind of masters of. They're the Israelis and people like Mark Levin, but I repeat myself, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1813.86s)]
*  they're always attempting to put these poison pills into a would-be negotiation for peace [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1821.94s)]
*  because they don't want peace, they want war. And so this is like what Israel does, right, with [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1827.46s)]
*  Israel's, you know, this was always the, for many, many years, the, so the talking point, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1832.02s)]
*  this isn't exactly accurate, or this isn't the entire story, but the talking point for many years [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1838.82s)]
*  was that the surrounding Arab countries to Israel refused to recognize Israel's right to exist. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1844.9s)]
*  I remember this vividly from when I was a kid. Now, okay, so the dynamic here obviously is that [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1851.7s)]
*  like when Israel, the state of Israel was first created, the surrounding Arab countries didn't [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1860.42s)]
*  recognize its right to exist, meaning like, yeah, they didn't want this state here that had just [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1865.8600000000001s)]
*  ethnically cleansed the Palestinians out of it. But years later, this is the way they would frame [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1870.34s)]
*  it, is they would say, look, none of them even accept our right to exist, so how can you negotiate [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1875.78s)]
*  with your neighbors? And like, okay, there's a bit of a point to that. I mean, all countries are, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1880.5s)]
*  or all nation states are founded illegitimately on a moral level, so okay, fine. At a certain point, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1885.06s)]
*  you could kind of insist your neighbors have to recognize your right to exist. And then they all [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1892.1799999999998s)]
*  did. They all recognized Israel's right to exist. There was Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1897.14s)]
*  the United Arab Emirates, like all these countries, Qatar, they all recognized Israel's right to [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1904.66s)]
*  exist. Even the PLO and Hamas at different points have recognized Israel's right to exist. So then, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1910.18s)]
*  this was a Netanyahu invention, and this is what you'll hear today. You may not even notice this [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1916.74s)]
*  sometimes when you hear it, but now they'll say, do you recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1920.98s)]
*  state? And the reason they insist on that is because they know that'll be a bridge too far [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1928.74s)]
*  for their Arab neighbors. Not all of them, but for some of them, and for groups like Hamas or [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1935.8600000000001s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority even, or things like that. If you ask them, does Israel have the right [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1942.58s)]
*  to exist as a Jewish state? Well, now there's a poison pill in there because 20% of their population [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1946.5s)]
*  is Arab. And so now you're asking other Arabs, it'd be like asking black people in Canada [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1952.5s)]
*  to accept the United States' right to exist as a white state. Like, well, yeah, they're probably [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1960.18s)]
*  not going to agree with that. So the intention isn't ever to negotiate a peace. The intention [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1967.38s)]
*  is to put a poison pill into the peace negotiations so it's impossible. So the reason they wanted to [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1971.78s)]
*  insist that Iran has no enrichment of uranium at all is because they know that's something they [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1978.42s)]
*  won't agree to. So it's not that you're concerned with them getting a nuke. If you were concerned [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1984.42s)]
*  with them getting a nuke, you'd want to have an inspections regime. You'd want to negotiate away [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1989.46s)]
*  that possibility. The reason why they insist on this thing that they know won't be accepted is so [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1993.54s)]
*  the deal falls apart and they can say, look, we tried to make a deal. Now our only option is war. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=1999.38s)]
*  That's the whole game. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2004.2600000000002s)]
*  which is Monetary Metals, an amazing company run by amazing people that I've been telling you about [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2009.3000000000002s)]

*  or it might just be collecting dust at home. But now there's a new way to own precious metals [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2025.3s)]
*  where they work for you with Monetary Metals. Now you're not just owning gold and silver, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2030.8999999999999s)]
*  but it's stored for you at no cost. Plus you earn interest on your precious metals in precious [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2036.34s)]
*  metals. So if you own gold, you're accruing interest paid in additional ounces, same with silver. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2042.8999999999999s)]
*  If that sounds interesting to you, go check them out at monetary-metals.com. That's [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2048.82s)]
*  monetary-metals.com. All right, let's get back into the show. I did want to say this, I guess, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2054.42s)]
*  before we wrap up and maybe I'll make this a little bit of a shorter episode and then try to [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2059.94s)]
*  put out some more stuff this week. Look, I don't want to, I'm not trying to create a situation [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2064.1000000000004s)]
*  here where like, you know, heads I win, tails you lose type thing. And I'm not, look, it is possible [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2074.02s)]
*  if, you know, some people were saying, I don't know if you guys saw, I was trending all day [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2082.02s)]
*  yesterday on Twitter because I, you know, came out and, you know, was very critical of Donald Trump. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2086.58s)]
*  And then later in the day, him and Tucker Carlson had a fallout and that was, you know, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2094.18s)]
*  really stupid of Donald Trump. Just, you know, it's unbelievable. It is one of the things about [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2100.26s)]
*  Donald Trump that, and look, this isn't new to me. I've always known this. But one of the major [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2106.0200000000004s)]
*  problems with Donald Trump is that he is just such a terrible person. He's like a really bad person. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2111.1400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I don't care. Honestly, I don't care about who my president is personally. Like, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2120.26s)]
*  they don't have to personally be somebody who I like or respect. If they're good at the job, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2125.78s)]
*  they're good at the job. But when you're such a terrible person, it seeps into how good of a [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2129.62s)]
*  president you're able to be. You know, like Tucker Carlson gave the keynote speech at the Republican [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2135.38s)]
*  National Convention. He was Donald Trump's champion. He has been his giving him like intellectual [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2142.58s)]
*  cover and, and moving the needle with his supporters. I mean, like, he's just been enormously [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2150.42s)]
*  loyal and helpful to Donald Trump. And of course, the second a reporter tried to drive a wedge in [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2156.02s)]
*  between them, Donald Trump takes the bait right away and throws the guy who did so much for him [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2161.46s)]
*  under the bus, just because that's the type of guy he is. It's all about him. It's all his own [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2166.1s)]
*  narcissism and ego. But I will say that, you know, there were a lot of people who were telling me, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2170.5s)]
*  you know, the Trump loyalists who were telling me yesterday that I'm overreacting. I shouldn't have [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2176.66s)]
*  jumped off so quick. And I should wait, let's see how this plays out. He's kept us out of wars [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2181.3s)]
*  before he'll keep us out of this one or whatever. I disagree. I don't I think we're already in this [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2185.7000000000003s)]
*  war. We're already at war with around the question now is how bad it will get. And the potential is [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2192.5800000000004s)]
*  that it could get very, very bad. I hope I'm wrong about that. I hope I hope to look foolish on this. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2197.86s)]
*  I hope that nothing ends up happening, although it doesn't it doesn't seem like that's going to be [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2203.7000000000003s)]
*  the case. But I will say that we we don't have too much power. We you know, the the the influence [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2208.1s)]
*  that people who have shows have is well, look, it would have been probably at its highest during [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2221.14s)]
*  the election. I mean, that's when politicians really need you at this point. Donald Trump doesn't [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2228.8199999999997s)]
*  have to run for reelection. I mean, yeah, he's you know, there's he's got midterms coming up and [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2233.14s)]
*  he needs to be able to get his agenda through. There's still some need to have, you know, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2238.2599999999998s)]
*  popular support. But the fact is that I think I think at this point, the message has been sent [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2242.5s)]
*  that and this is not me. This is much, much bigger than me. I'm a small, maybe a small part of this. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2251.7s)]
*  But the I mean, I've really been kind of blown away by how amazing Tucker Carlson has been on this, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2258.82s)]
*  how great Steve Bannon has been on this. Jack Pasebiak has been great on this. Even Charlie [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2268.02s)]
*  Kirk was talking about how like this will act like the MAGA base does not want America involved in [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2277.94s)]
*  this war. This will absolutely be devastating. There have been so many people I apologize to [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2283.38s)]
*  anybody who I'm leaving out here. But at the very least, I think what what all of these guys have [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2288.18s)]
*  been able to do is create a situation where like last night when Donald Trump saying evacuate [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2295.46s)]
*  Tehran, he on some level and this has to be a calculation because I mean, this is politics after [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2302.5s)]
*  all. We've been able to impose a cost of escalating this war. And the cost is that [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2308.9s)]
*  you will divide your base. Candice Owens was has been phenomenal on this as well. I should have [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2320.1s)]
*  mentioned her. And there's not that much more that people like us can do than that, then at least add [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2325.3s)]
*  to the cost for you personally of what escalating this war would be or starting to take direct US [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2333.22s)]
*  strikes on Tehran or whatever. And at this point, I do think it's been made perfectly clear that [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2339.7s)]
*  this will destroy your coalition. This will destroy the MAGA base. It will divide it. And [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2346.8199999999997s)]
*  already you've seen it's making enemies out of people who all supported Donald Trump. And again, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2354.2599999999998s)]
*  there's not that much more that we can do. But at this point, that to me seems like the best. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2361.62s)]
*  It seems like the best the best thing to do is to just make it known that there you will lose [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2367.8599999999997s)]
*  support over this. Is that enough to stop what's coming from happening? Probably not. But I do have [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2373.22s)]
*  to say, it's going to be this is going to be a fascinating new reality that we're living in. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2381.7s)]
*  It almost it's almost on the level of when Donald Trump almost got shot. And then you would sit there [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2390.5s)]
*  for days afterward, and even weeks and months and even, you know, now, looking back at it, you look [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2397.7s)]
*  back at it, and you're like, Whoa, we would have been living in a completely different country. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2405.2999999999997s)]
*  Like we were almost living in a completely different world, where Donald Trump got his brains [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2410.5s)]
*  blown out on national television. And now who know, I don't know, does JD fan step up and run? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2416.5s)]
*  What's going on here? Is there violence in the streets as response to this? Like, it just would [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2421.46s)]
*  have been such a crazy different world. And I did, you know, last night, when Donald Trump put out [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2425.94s)]
*  that ominous tweet saying everybody evacuate Tehran, and you're like, my holy shit, what's he [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2432.74s)]
*  about to do? Also, by the way, keep in mind what Scott was saying earlier about his sources, who I [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2437.14s)]
*  also have talked to some of the same sources, they they told me when Israel was going to strike, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2444.02s)]
*  and they were right about that. And then they told me America is going to strike Monday night. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2449.38s)]
*  And then Donald Trump put out that tweet. So it certainly seemed like there was something there [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2453.46s)]
*  to who you know, this, the, for these sources that they had some information. And [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2458.18s)]
*  I remember my first reaction last night, as I saw that that post from Donald Trump was like, Oh, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2466.66s)]
*  we're in a whole new world now. Now it didn't end up happening last night. Who knows? Maybe this has [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2473.46s)]
*  been avoided now, and it's not going to happen. Or maybe, you know, it was just postponed by a day [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2479.86s)]
*  or two, maybe it's going to happen right now while I'm recording. Who knows? But I, you know, we were [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2485.06s)]
*  staring down the precipice of like a whole new moment. This is going to be something totally I [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2490.7400000000002s)]
*  mean, imagine they're going to launch a war that they haven't even rolled out a propaganda campaign [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2495.94s)]
*  for. This isn't like, you know, 911 happened, of course, in September of 2001, we invaded Iraq in [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2502.7400000000002s)]
*  2003, they spent the entire 2002 rolling out the war propaganda and convincing everybody in America, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2508.9s)]
*  that's Adam Hussein was in on 911, and he had weapons of mass destruction and all of this stuff. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2517.38s)]
*  They just simply haven't done that this time. It's basically just Israel doesn't get along with one [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2522.74s)]
*  of their neighbors and they wanted to go attack them. That's enough to get a man. I mean, it was [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2527.4599999999996s)]
*  immediately going to shatter MAGA. And then there would have been two MAGA that emerged and there [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2533.3799999999997s)]
*  would have been like the war hawks and the anti-war MAGA. We would have now been the insurgency. I mean, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2539.54s)]
*  you know, you're in a situation. I was thinking about this last night where it's like, well, who's [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2545.7s)]
*  going to oppose Donald Trump in this crazy war? The Democrats who are sitting at a 24% approval [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2548.98s)]
*  rating and have completely destroyed their credibility. No, it's not going to be them. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2555.06s)]
*  Who's left? It's the MAGA people, the people who supported Donald Trump who were opposed to war. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2559.78s)]
*  So it was just like an interesting moment. And look, already, this is true to some degree, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2567.46s)]
*  to some degree, things have changed a lot, but not like what it would have been if, you know, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2574.02s)]
*  thinking Donald Trump might start carpet bombing Tehran. We will see where this goes over the next [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2578.42s)]
*  few days, but this is going to be an interesting time period. And I don't know it like if they were [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2586.18s)]
*  really going to do what it looked like they were going to do last night. And like this really was [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2595.22s)]
*  going to be a major war, you know, and a US war. They haven't rolled out like, like there's just [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2599.14s)]
*  several things happening here. Number one, they haven't rolled out the propaganda to even get [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2605.54s)]
*  picked. What typically happens with wars is I'm sure most of you guys who are, you know, like [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2611.06s)]
*  some of I got some young people listening to the show, but for you guys who are like closer to my [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2615.54s)]
*  age or older, you know, you know how this is. They roll out the propaganda, they get everybody [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2619.3s)]
*  all excited, war fever sweeps the nation. The war is very popular at the beginning. And then little [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2624.42s)]
*  by little as the cost of war becomes more and more apparent, it becomes very unpopular. And then [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2630.82s)]
*  years later, you got all these people, you know, pretending that they never supported the thing or [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2635.94s)]
*  apologizing for supporting it or whatever. That's how it typically goes. But you're telling me that [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2640.9s)]
*  right now you're about to have a major US war, and you haven't even rolled out a propaganda campaign. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2645.2200000000003s)]
*  And also add into that, we have the decentralized media now. And like, if you just can't control [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2651.06s)]
*  the narrative in the same way that you used to be able to, in order to pull something like that off, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2659.46s)]
*  they're going to have to silence us. I don't know exactly how they're going to do that, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2664.66s)]
*  but they're going to have to try to add. So just all of these things, you know, I'm like thinking [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2668.5s)]
*  about this last night. It's like we are, you know, now again, it didn't happen last night. We will [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2673.54s)]
*  see what happens going forward, but we really are like on the precipice of something new. And, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2678.1s)]
*  um, you know, it's a, it's a little bit concerning to say the least, but it's exciting [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2684.58s)]
*  and interesting and terrifying. But this is perhaps like what, what needs to come. It would [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2692.34s)]
*  have been nice if Donald Trump had, had avoided this situation. But not only has he not done that, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2699.38s)]
*  but he's bragging about having brought us here. And I'm, I'm, as I was mentioning earlier in the [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2705.54s)]
*  show, very interested to see what happens with Tulsi Gabbard here. I mean, you know, I think she [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2712.58s)]
*  should resign. I really do. I don't know if she will. So we'll, we'll see, but, uh, there is no [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2718.74s)]
*  question that from, of course, Donald Trump is always on every side of every issue. Of course, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBweCEFejLs&t=2724.8199999999997s)]
