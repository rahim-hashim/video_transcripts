# Dave Smith  The Next Fake Pandemic  Part Of The Problem 1211
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo)
*  What's up everybody? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of the Problem. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=24.64s)]
*  I am Dave Smith and that lovely lady over to my left is Robbie the fire Bernstein. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=27.04s)]
*  How are you doing, sir? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=32.48s)]
*  I am prepared to tell the fans about my vagina yet. So, you know, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=33.64s)]
*  you kind of spoiled the news for 2025. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=37.2s)]
*  Wow. Didn't think I was out in you there, bro. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=39.68s)]
*  Thought it was pretty obvious you were a chick, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=41.96s)]
*  but I guess some people were still fooled 2025. Now this is very, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=44.16s)]
*  that's all that shit's over, man. That's 2022 stuff. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Woke's dead. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=52.56s)]
*  That's what makes it cool. Now, now I'm going against the grain again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=53.4s)]
*  Yes, that's right. Yeah. Well that's see now it, oh man, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=56.4s)]
*  maybe this is a fucked up thing. I shouldn't say. Uh, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=61.08s)]
*  but isn't there something to the fact that in a way [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=63.8s)]
*  what the woke left was trying to do for years was to mainstream [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=69.68s)]
*  things that are definitionally fringe. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=74.36s)]
*  And doesn't that Rob some of it a little bit, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=78.8s)]
*  like wasn't that part of what was cool is that you were like, Oh, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=81.2s)]
*  you're doing something totally out there and different and you're, you know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=84.4s)]
*  but if everybody's, if every major corporation is pushing it, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=87.88s)]
*  then it's not fun anymore. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=90.76s)]
*  There's almost something fun about the way you'd still see a, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=92.44s)]
*  like a guy who dresses like a hippie and be like, yeah, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=95.16s)]
*  well I grew up in the sixties. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=98.12s)]
*  It's like some dude at a bar who has a vagina and be like, ah, you know what, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=99.24s)]
*  I got out of college in 2022 and that's just what people were doing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=102.64s)]
*  Right. I know. Well, yeah, like a bad tattoo, I guess in a way, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=107.08s)]
*  but I will say that it did at least in the sixties, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=110.84s)]
*  it kind of felt. And look, I, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=115.48s)]
*  obviously I know what I know about the sixties from like reading books and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=117.8s)]
*  watching documentaries. I wasn't alive at the time, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=121.48s)]
*  but it did at least to some degree feel where like if you had, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=124.28s)]
*  let's say you had a, we're talking boomers in the sixties and you had, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=128.56s)]
*  your parents, I guess are in the greatest generation. You know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=133.36s)]
*  your parents are like these squares. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=135.96s)]
*  They were raised in an environment where every family was like a family of seven [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=138.28s)]
*  or eight kids. Nobody got divorced. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=143.28s)]
*  Everybody was Christian, right? So to be a hippie in the sixties, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=147.0s)]
*  you were to some degree really rebelling against what the order was that you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=151.24s)]
*  grew up under and you were against the war in Vietnam. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=157.16s)]
*  You're literally against the machines war of what they wanted to fight. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  And you could, you know, go look at, by the way, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=165.16s)]
*  most people today, if they haven't actually studied this stuff, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=168.8s)]
*  when you think of the sixties, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=171.96s)]
*  what most people think of in their head is like tie dye and acid and anti-war [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=173.76s)]
*  protests and things like that. All of that is the last two years of the sixties. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=179.12s)]
*  It's 1968 and 1969. None of that existed for most of the sixties. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  But what pop culture was, was all like, you know, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=189.72s)]
*  square. It, what, what, what you think of when you hear of the 1950s in your head, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  that's what TV looked like in 1965. If you're like, gee, pa, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  you mind if I help with the yard work? Well, come on, little Timmy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=203.8s)]
*  Also like that was, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=206.56s)]
*  and so to be a hippie was in some profound sense rebelling against, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  you were a dissident. You weren't, but like over the last few years, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  and I remember making this comment a bunch and I know you have to, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=217.4s)]
*  we're far from the only ones who have said it, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=220.36s)]
*  but you'd have like these woke college kids and it would just be like, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=222.16s)]
*  you'd be looking at them and you'd be like, wait a minute. So you agree with, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  by the way, your liberal parents, they agree with you. Um, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=229.16s)]
*  you didn't grow up in some other, your, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=232.56s)]
*  you grew up with divorced parents in liberal America and all of that shit. Uh, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=234.72s)]
*  you agree with every single one of your college professors. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=239.96s)]
*  You agree with everyone in the political class and you agree with every giant [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  corporation, but yet you still have the air. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=246.28s)]
*  Like you're rebelling against something and that there's something about that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=249.4s)]
*  That's almost sad, right? Like, what do you, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  what do you walk around with a my principles number one t-shirt? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=257.4s)]
*  Like what the fuck is this? You're supposed to be a kid. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=260.24s)]
*  You're supposed to be rebelling against this thing. And I don't care. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=262.68s)]
*  If you don't want to rebel, that's fine, but don't act like you are. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=265.0s)]
*  You're not at least I have some respect for the new left in the sixties who were [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=269.56s)]
*  at least that's what they used to call them. Um, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=273.68s)]
*  who were at least like shaking things up and they were dead right about the war [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=276.68s)]
*  in Vietnam and they were wrong about a lot of other stuff. But you know, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=281.48s)]
*  what are you going to do? Acid was new. They had to figure it out. Well, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=285.72s)]
*  I don't know by the way, I watched, uh, for the first time, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=289.52s)]
*  my daughter who is six, she watched, um, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=293.08s)]
*  the wizard of Oz and I sat and watched that movie with her. Um, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=296.76s)]
*  which is probably the first time I've watched the wizard of Oz, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=301.36s)]
*  like front to back in 30 years. Those monkeys are scary though. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=304.08s)]
*  It is. It was, it's a great movie. It's a classic. Uh, my daughter loved it, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=308.64s)]
*  but it, it was made in like 1938 or something like that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=313.12s)]
*  And I'm just, someone got their hands on some acid. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=317.4s)]
*  I know that people might say acid wasn't around yet at that point, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=319.88s)]
*  but someone got their hands on something in order to make that movie. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what it was. Maybe aliens, something. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  He turned the heat down a little bit if you don't mind. Um, anyway, yeah, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=329.4s)]
*  good movie. My daughter enjoyed it real good. Uh, real good for the, uh, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=333.92s)]
*  the imagination if I do say so myself. Um, okay. Anything, Rob, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=338.72s)]
*  anything you want to plug before we, uh, get into some stuff here? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=343.36s)]
*  Yeah, this Wednesday I'm doing a big, uh, new year's episode. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=346.16s)]
*  So if you're home, you got nothing going on, probably going live. I don't know. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=348.72s)]
*  Maybe 8 p.m. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=352.0s)]
*  I filmed a bunch of sketches for it this past Sunday and I got a lot of stuff [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=352.76s)]
*  going on. So if you're home with nothing to do, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=356.2s)]

*  I'm very much looking forward to, I have, uh, I'm almost done with the year. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=401.76s)]
*  I've never been finished this early before. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=406.88s)]
*  So it's kind of nice to go into the year with your schedule worked out. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  And then of course, you know, there'll always be more things that get added. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=412.32s)]
*  All right. So I wanted to start with this, uh, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  which, uh, so, uh, Lina Wen, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  who for anybody who does not recall was, um, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  how do I say this diplomatically? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  One of the worst people in the world. I don't know what she, uh, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=435.32s)]
*  was one of the experts in the expert class, uh, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=438.56s)]
*  during COVID who was, um, and I put quotes around expert class, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=442.91999999999996s)]
*  who was just absolutely just a monster, just literally horrible. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=447.88s)]
*  I mean, you cannot overstate it enough. Um, this was somebody who was, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=452.64s)]
*  we need to take people's freedoms because if we take their freedoms, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=455.8s)]
*  then they'll have the incentive to actually follow all of our dictations. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=459.04s)]
*  Yes. This was, uh, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=463.64s)]
*  she was the one who was out on the news shows [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=464.72s)]
*  advocating for, um, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=469.56s)]
*  vaccine mandates and stripping basic constitutional rights away from the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=472.16s)]
*  unvaccinated. And her, her argument at the time was that if we, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=476.4s)]
*  um, she, she said, I mean, I'm not exaggerating. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=481.4s)]
*  We played the clip on the show, I think twice actually, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=484.84s)]
*  but she said that if we, if we don't do that, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  then there's no incentive for people to get vaccinated. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=492.08s)]
*  And so we have to take away so many things of the, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=495.28s)]
*  the basic participation in society from the unvaccinated. Now, listen, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=498.32s)]
*  that is just to be clear, that is evil enough on its own, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=503.4s)]
*  but man, when your vaccine turns out to not work, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=508.47999999999996s)]
*  it really makes it so much worse. Um, and, and calls into question, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  how are you still invited on the news? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=515.8399999999999s)]
*  It's outrageous that there's at the very least, look, I mean, exiled. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  It's, it's very easy for people in a knee jerk way to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=523.24s)]
*  say, um, that all these people should be in jail. Uh, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=527.9599999999999s)]
*  I literally was just having, um, I just, some, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=531.7199999999999s)]
*  one of my friends who is a very, uh, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=535.52s)]
*  very famous influential person was just texting me that earlier this morning, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=538.2399999999999s)]
*  um, saying these people should all be in jail. And it's very easy to say that, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=543.16s)]
*  um, I, you know, I, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=547.8s)]
*  I don't know that I exactly can get there, you know, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=550.4s)]
*  but for all of the people who are in the corporate media, who, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=554.76s)]
*  there's an argument, a lot of them should be in jail. I mean, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=559.88s)]
*  they are in the business of selling the warfare state and all this stuff. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=562.28s)]
*  But the people even who were just like, which is another topic we'll get into [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=566.4s)]
*  today, the people who are lying through their teeth about Joe Biden's age or his [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  dementia rather, I should say, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=574.3199999999999s)]
*  and the people who were just lying through the COVID. I mean, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=575.8s)]
*  even if you don't take the position that they should be in jail, which by the way, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=580.28s)]
*  I think is a fairly moderate position. Um, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=583.6s)]
*  but even if you don't take that position, yeah, at the very least, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  shouldn't you just like live in shame? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=589.8399999999999s)]
*  Shouldn't you not be invited back onto news shows? I mean, it really, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=593.28s)]
*  it's not that much to ask. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  And so much of the problem, and I know Rob, you, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=600.4s)]
*  you talked about this many, many times over the years, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=604.04s)]
*  but so much of the problem that we have in this country with the just rampant [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=607.04s)]
*  corruption is the fact, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=611.56s)]
*  the very simple fact that there are no consequences for the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=613.5600000000001s)]
*  people who just push all the worst lies that lead to the most destructive [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=618.48s)]
*  policies. They just don't have, it's like in the market for as flawed as the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=623.32s)]
*  market might be, which is as flawed as humans are, there's a cleansing mechanism. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=627.88s)]
*  You know, there's still, you still see it even look, even, uh, with, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=632.72s)]
*  you see it with, um, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=638.16s)]
*  with shows where they get everything wrong and then their, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=639.48s)]
*  their ratings go way down. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=642.48s)]
*  You see it with businesses where they misallocate resources and so their [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=644.16s)]
*  profits dry up. But in this game of government, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=647.4s)]
*  it all the people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=651.48s)]
*  all still have high paying jobs. There's no repercussions. Well, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=655.24s)]
*  except, you know, losing the trust of the American people. Anyway, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=659.76s)]
*  um, this woman is going back around or she was on, uh, um, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  was it ABC? I think I could be wrong about that. Which show was it? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=669.04s)]
*  They all blend in the same. Yes, it was ABC's face the nation. Um, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=672.76s)]
*  I will say before we get into the substance of these clips, I do, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=677.52s)]
*  there is in some way I kind of like when women like this come back [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  around because it at least then is an opportunity for all of us to remind [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  everybody what these monsters did to us over the last four years and just how, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=690.92s)]
*  you know, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=696.5999999999999s)]
*  how insane it is that they even get a seat at the table anymore. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=697.28s)]
*  I it's shocking that you can come back out as an expert after having been so [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=702.56s)]
*  wrong. And in her case, not just so wrong, but showcasing your hands that, uh, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=706.28s)]
*  you're not, it seems like she's working for the regime or gets a paycheck from [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=710.68s)]
*  someone very specific and, uh, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=714.7199999999999s)]
*  is the face of going out there and selling an agenda. So, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  well it's also one of the things I think that COVID opened people up to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=720.92s)]
*  was like how, which I guess, you know, if you've, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=725.92s)]
*  if you're at all familiar with like say like, uh, I dunno, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=730.0s)]
*  like Nazi scientists or like commie scientists and some of the like really [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=733.4s)]
*  fucked up shit that they would do, it's, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=738.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't know that there was ever such an obvious example in America, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=741.0s)]
*  in modern American history. Obviously there have been other examples. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  What I'm saying, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=748.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if there was such an obvious example in such a large scale where [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=748.4399999999999s)]
*  you just kind of would see like, Oh, how evil [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=752.04s)]
*  science can be. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=756.96s)]
*  And if it's not like rooted in any theory and this isn't me saying like, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=759.2s)]
*  everybody has to have the perfect philosophical worldview. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=765.08s)]
*  That's not how human beings work. But I mean like any, even loosely, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=768.32s)]
*  a S like kind of in some vague sense, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=773.52s)]
*  you have some belief in what the things that are kind of just given to you, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=776.84s)]
*  to all of us. I don't mean like strict libertarians like us, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=782.0s)]
*  but just the idea that like humans have some rights. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=784.76s)]
*  Humans have the right to a fair trial. They have the right to face their accuser. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=787.48s)]
*  They have the right of, you know, something. And if you don't have that, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=791.44s)]
*  it's very easy to just like go in these very dark authoritarian directions. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=797.12s)]
*  You know, for the age old example, um, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=802.88s)]
*  that was always like a, um, a critique of utilitarianism, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=806.56s)]
*  uh, was that, okay, so if a doctor, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=811.36s)]
*  let's just say hypothetically speaking, your doc, you go in for a checkup, um, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=815.56s)]
*  or you go in cause like your wrist hurts or something like that. And your doctor, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=820.76s)]
*  while you're not looking, um, he sedates you, uh, puts you unconscious, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=824.56s)]
*  um, kills you and takes all of your organs. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=830.48s)]
*  And I forget the exact number of what you can save with one human being, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=834.08s)]
*  but like for the sake of argument, he saves seven other people's lives. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=838.32s)]
*  He takes your heart, gives it to someone who needed a heart transplant, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=841.96s)]
*  takes your liver, takes your spleen, you know, whatever. Now, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=844.88s)]
*  you could just from a strictly utilitarian point of view, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  you could say the doctor did a good thing. It'd be like, well, you'd be like, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=853.32s)]
*  Hey, he killed one person, but he saved seven other people. And if you're not, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=857.0s)]
*  if you're just thinking in terms of efficiency or, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=862.0400000000001s)]
*  you know, um, uh, outcomes, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  you could get yourself to a place where like, if you, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  if you're removed from any theory on human rights, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=872.4399999999999s)]
*  you could get yourself to a place where you're supporting that. You're going, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=875.76s)]
*  Hey, saving seven people is more important than losing one person. You know, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=878.8399999999999s)]
*  like you can end now all of us on some basic level, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=882.12s)]
*  I think almost everyone in America at least has some type of knee jerk reaction [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=886.68s)]
*  against that. They go, Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no. You just, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=891.24s)]
*  no, you can't do that. You don't have a right to do that. You know, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=894.4s)]
*  your doctor does not have a right to kill you. You didn't consent to this. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=896.84s)]
*  Like we have some libertarian ish impulse still, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=899.72s)]
*  but you would see with people like this when lady that they just had none of [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  that. And so even by the way, of course, the double whammy at the end of it was, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=908.6800000000001s)]
*  they turned out to be wrong or lying about the vaccine anyway. So it didn't work, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=913.58s)]
*  but you could see where in their mind they were just like, okay, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=917.88s)]
*  we're taking it as a given that the vaccine works. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=921.22s)]
*  And now we're working back from there. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=924.2s)]
*  The answer is what gets this in the most people's arms and whatever we have to do [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=926.08s)]
*  to get there is therefore justified. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=930.04s)]
*  And she would just explicitly say this that you should lose your basic rates if [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=932.12s)]
*  you don't get this brand new vaccine, which again, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  she turned out to be completely wrong about anyway. Here she is back on ABC's, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=939.6800000000001s)]
*  face the nation. Let's check in with the monster Lena. When [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=943.64s)]
*  there are two main things that they should be doing in the days that they have [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=948.12s)]
*  left. The first is to get testing out there. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=951.14s)]
*  I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=954.18s)]
*  aren't testing, it doesn't mean that the virus isn't there. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=957.1s)]
*  It just means that we aren't looking for it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=959.98s)]
*  We should be having rapid tests, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=961.86s)]
*  home tests available to all farm workers, to their families, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=963.9399999999999s)]
*  for the clinicians taking care of them so that we aren't waiting for public labs [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=967.22s)]
*  and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=971.9s)]
*  And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=975.1s)]
*  where we were dealing with a new virus. We didn't have a vaccine. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=978.34s)]
*  There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=981.5400000000001s)]
*  The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=985.34s)]
*  million doses of the vaccine. However, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=989.5400000000001s)]
*  they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There's research done on it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=992.0600000000001s)]
*  They could get this authorized now and also get the vaccine out. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=996.6600000000001s)]
*  So, and to farm workers and to vulnerable people, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1000.34s)]
*  I think that's the right approach because we don't know what the Trump [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1003.26s)]
*  administration is going to be doing around bird flu. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1005.66s)]
*  If they have people come in with anti-vaccine stances, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1008.38s)]
*  could they hold up vaccine authorization? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1011.5s)]
*  If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1013.8199999999999s)]
*  could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1017.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1020.9399999999999s)]
*  and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1024.3s)]
*  health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1029.02s)]
*  Dr. Wen, is bird flu in humans super dangerous? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1032.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, the World Health Organization estimates that in prior outbreaks of the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1036.3799999999999s)]
*  bird flu, that the mortality rate is 52%. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1040.34s)]
*  52%. However, in the, in this most recent outbreak, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1044.06s)]
*  it seems that most cases have been wild and maybe some people even have [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1048.82s)]
*  asymptomatic infection. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1052.5s)]
*  But the question is we don't know what happens when bird flu affects more [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1054.02s)]
*  vulnerable individuals. People infected so far in the U S have been mainly farm [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1057.82s)]
*  workers who are working presumably generally healthy, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1062.1s)]
*  as opposed to what happens when you get to children to pregnant women, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1065.62s)]
*  to older individuals with chronic illnesses. We don't know how deadly, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1069.26s)]
*  how dangerous bird flu is going to be for those individuals. And again, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1073.6999999999998s)]
*  that's one more reason why we don't want it to spread and acquire more mutations. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1076.82s)]
*  All right. I mean, I don't, I can't explain what a throwback this is. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1081.2199999999998s)]
*  It just, it reminds me of, of being in the COVID era, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1085.6599999999999s)]
*  when you would constantly have to like read between the lines and you [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1090.54s)]
*  almost, we would do this like regularly. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1095.34s)]
*  This is what we would always do through the height of COVID was like play clips [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1097.06s)]
*  like this, and then be like, pay attention to what Fouchy just really said, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1100.06s)]
*  like pay attention to what she just really said, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1103.62s)]
*  cause she sandwiches it in between this absolute nonsense [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1105.4599999999998s)]
*  fear-mongering. So it starts with like, well, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1110.1399999999999s)]
*  the World Health Organization has estimated it could be up to 52%. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1112.8999999999999s)]
*  Do you know how scary 52% is? Oh my God. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1116.74s)]
*  Imagine 52% just killing everybody. And then like in there, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1119.22s)]
*  there's a little nugget. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1122.5s)]
*  All the cases we've seen have been very mild and not a problem at all, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1123.66s)]
*  but it hasn't hit old people and babies and this, and it's just like the way, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1126.06s)]
*  you're like, and then they have the nerve to be like, and this is the science. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1129.9s)]
*  Like you're not doing science. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1133.22s)]
*  Science would be giving a very clear answer right there. Nope. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1135.14s)]
*  Seems like nothing to worry about. All of the recent outbreaks have been mild. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1138.54s)]
*  In fact, a lot of people who get it are completely asymptomatic. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1142.5s)]
*  Where have we heard that before? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1145.9s)]
*  But the other thing that it's just such a throwback to me, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1148.14s)]
*  and I'm curious to get your thoughts on this Rob, but this is just, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1150.46s)]
*  I've just seen this movie before you are, it's a, it's, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1153.7s)]
*  you're a neocon selling the war in Libya. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1157.54s)]
*  You're a neocon selling the war in Syria. It's like, I remember these people, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1160.82s)]
*  like right after, right after they went all in on Saddam has weapons of mass [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1164.54s)]
*  destruction and oh my God, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1169.3s)]
*  democracy will sweep the region and we'll be greeted as liberators and the war [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1170.5s)]
*  will be paid for an oil and all. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1174.3799999999999s)]
*  And then they're wrong about every single prediction and with zero shame, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1176.34s)]
*  with zero shame, they get right back on the same show and go, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1181.1799999999998s)]
*  now we got to go fight this war. And let me tell you something, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1184.4199999999998s)]
*  we'll be greeted as liberators and democracy will sweep the region and it'll be [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1187.1s)]
*  so much better after that, blah, blah, blah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1190.58s)]
*  And then they come do the same thing with Syria, by the way, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1192.86s)]
*  there's been a bunch of be headings in Syria this week. If you haven't checked, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1194.82s)]
*  who would have thought Al Qaeda taking over a country could have negative [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1198.6999999999998s)]
*  consequences. Um, but I, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1202.3s)]
*  you just can't imagine like having no shame while you're making this, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1204.7s)]
*  but like you just, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1210.78s)]
*  you're famous for getting the vaccine on COVID all wrong and selling all of the [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1211.94s)]
*  bullshit. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1218.1000000000001s)]
*  And then you're coming right back on now to advocate another vaccine for a thing [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1219.02s)]
*  that is not even a problem is just, it's unbelievable. Uh, go ahead, Rob. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1224.1000000000001s)]
*  All right. Well, I don't want to completely overplay, uh, my, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1229.46s)]
*  my cards here cause, uh, COVID happened in real time and I was fascinated by it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1233.5s)]
*  And I did a lot of research and I did my homework. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1237.38s)]
*  I'm not familiar with the avian flu other than I'm a little checked out on doing [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1239.6200000000001s)]
*  my homework and I'm like, I don't know, it's like flashing lights in the sky. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1244.18s)]
*  I'm not ready to panic and give power over to government. Right. Uh, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1247.3400000000001s)]
*  with that said, I can't stand the way this lady talks. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1250.66s)]
*  It's like this panic of my child during the well, but we can get the well, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1253.3400000000001s)]
*  where's the sheriff? How come they're not out there? So firstly, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1258.02s)]
*  she's got this tonality, which is trained to Institute. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1261.26s)]
*  How come we're not all panicked? Uh, but the one time he, so he goes, how, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1264.8999999999999s)]
*  and you, you caught it, but goes, how deadly is this? He goes, well, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1269.26s)]
*  the who has said it's upwards of 50%. And instantly before she continues, I go, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1272.62s)]
*  well, we've had a couple of cases in the U S or half of them dead. And then goes, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1276.82s)]
*  well, but if that's not, so in other words, you don't know. Right. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1280.3799999999999s)]
*  So you have no information on this and now this new vaccine that's been around. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1283.06s)]
*  So why isn't it approved? What, like, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1287.1s)]
*  what would this seems like we got a little bit of missing information here? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1289.54s)]
*  Is it a new mRNA vaccine? Is it a dead virus, more traditional vaccine? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1291.8999999999999s)]
*  What's the holdup on it? What do we have to push in and rush it through again? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1296.82s)]
*  Do you have evidence that kids are going to be more at risk? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1300.5s)]
*  Cause you really sold that the last time on the COVID thing. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1302.6999999999998s)]
*  And it turned out they were not dying because of the, and then, so I don't know, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1304.82s)]
*  it's just, it's, it's, it's hard to get too worked up. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1309.82s)]
*  And I can't believe that the regime doesn't even have, uh, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1312.58s)]
*  the dignity to get new characters out there to lie to us. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1315.5s)]
*  That with the straight face, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1319.38s)]
*  you can put this lady in front of me and have any reaction other than let's [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1320.46s)]
*  investigate her. Yeah. I mean, it's, it really is just unbelievable. I mean, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1325.1000000000001s)]
*  I try to think of like an analogy, but like it'd be like, I don't know. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1328.9s)]
*  I think if, um, like if, if. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1333.74s)]
*  It's your made off. It's like bringing made off back out to sell you on [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1337.7s)]
*  investments. Well, it'd be like, imagine, you know, you were like, uh, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1340.7s)]
*  your wife or something like that, like, ate some shellfish. And she was like, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1344.5s)]
*  I really don't feel good. And you're like, ah, don't worry about it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1348.3400000000001s)]
*  You're fine. Don't do nothing. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1350.78s)]
*  And then she ends up having like a terrible allergic reaction has to be rushed [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1352.1000000000001s)]
*  to the hospital nearly dies, you know? And then like the next week, she's like, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1355.3400000000001s)]
*  you know, I don't feel so good about this food. And you go, relax, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1359.14s)]
*  don't do anything like with zero shame that just last week you said the same [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1361.7s)]
*  thing and we're completely wrong. Wouldn't you immediately just be like, well, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1366.58s)]
*  I can't say that again. Cause I already, I got that so wrong. And like, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1370.14s)]
*  and I should be over correcting. Like the first thing I should do is like, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1374.5s)]
*  well, let's go to the hospital. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1378.22s)]
*  Let's just err on the side of safety because Jesus, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1379.26s)]
*  I don't want that to happen again. And you would think there'd be like, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1381.42s)]
*  it would at least be demonstrated that this last instance had had some effect on [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1384.54s)]
*  you say something or like, now we don't want to lose our minds the same way we [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1389.14s)]

*  It is nothing like that. And it's, and again, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1396.1000000000001s)]
*  it's just an indictment of Trump of, oh, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1399.06s)]
*  they may not take this seriously. They may not do the right things. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1402.7s)]
*  We got to get the tests ready now because who knows what this crazy new [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1406.3400000000001s)]
*  government's going to be as if the narrative is still that that's what happened [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1409.8200000000002s)]
*  last time. As if anybody there is, listen, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1413.94s)]
*  Donald Trump and I did end up voting for him this year. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1417.46s)]
*  And I am hopeful that some of his good appointments will get some good things [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1422.8600000000001s)]
*  done. We'll see, but I will never forgive Donald Trump for 2020. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1427.14s)]
*  And he never should be forgiven for that. And when, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1432.66s)]
*  like Donald Trump will have to meet his maker one day and explain why the hell [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1435.8200000000002s)]
*  he kept Fauci on the job for all of 2020 and supported lockdowns and all the [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1441.5s)]
*  awful things that he did during 2020. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1445.5800000000002s)]
*  But the idea that they're still trying to almost like live in the narrative that [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1448.8600000000001s)]
*  he just, his failure was that he didn't do anything. Like who, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1454.02s)]
*  who could argue that now? Who can actually look at from, look, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1458.3000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump was president from March of, I mean, obviously it was the president [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1461.9s)]
*  2016, but I'm saying for the COVID stuff, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1467.5s)]
*  he was president through all of 2020 the entire year of 2020 into January 20th [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1469.7s)]
*  of 2021. Donald Trump was the sitting president. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1475.3000000000002s)]
*  Can anyone argue that we didn't do enough during COVID? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1478.7800000000002s)]
*  We did more than has ever been done about anything. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1483.9s)]
*  We shut down the global economy, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1486.98s)]
*  but like somehow we're still supposed to look back and be like, Oh, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1490.18s)]
*  what was the re like? She doesn't explicitly say it, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1493.54s)]
*  but it's it's pretty clearly implied there that the real failure was that what [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1495.82s)]
*  we didn't listen to people like when the real failure was that like what we [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1500.22s)]
*  didn't whatever, I don't know. We, we, we didn't do enough. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1504.26s)]
*  It's absurd. It's such a bold face lie. And I just, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1509.74s)]
*  I don't know to me, this seems to be one of the things that's interesting. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1514.8600000000001s)]
*  About 2024 is that look, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1520.58s)]
*  Donald Trump after being such a disaster on COVID. And I know, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1524.26s)]
*  I know I have Trump supporters listening to me or like, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1527.66s)]
*  why are you blaming Trump for doing all this for him? I'm right. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1530.26s)]
*  He was terrible. You know, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1533.18s)]
*  you could support the guy and you still don't have to pretend he's a God, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1535.06s)]
*  which he's not. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1538.66s)]
*  But it is kind of interesting that we had these crazy years. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1541.06s)]
*  And then in 2024, it wasn't even really like a major campaign issue, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1544.22s)]
*  like even talking about COVID. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1548.3s)]
*  And yet you have Bobby Kennedy coming in at the health department. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1550.8999999999999s)]
*  You have Jay Bhattacharya at the NIH. You have like some of these, you know, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1554.26s)]
*  people who were real legit opposition to the COVID insanity. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1557.82s)]
*  But I will say the one thing, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1562.54s)]
*  the lasting impact of COVID was I do, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1564.26s)]
*  I shouldn't say the lasting impact. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1569.46s)]
*  We need more time before we'll really know what the true lasting impact was, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1570.62s)]
*  but it does seem, and I remember talking about this one, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1574.1s)]
*  I debated Chris Cuomo or in the aftermath or in the run up to it, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1576.98s)]
*  that all of the shows online, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1581.6200000000001s)]
*  like all the big shows that does seem to be the one area that we're all in [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1585.82s)]
*  agreement on. Like they, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1590.1s)]
*  the COVID shit was so insane that it created the, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1592.58s)]
*  the coalition of people who were against [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1597.26s)]
*  that stuff that ended up, I think all going to Trump. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1602.18s)]
*  And that coalition I do think is like a super majority at this point, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1605.74s)]
*  that the people who are saying like, yeah, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1610.82s)]
*  lockdowns and vaccine mandates were great is a clear minority. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1613.42s)]
*  I mean, that's just not, it's too obviously wrong. I think for most people, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1618.26s)]
*  especially when the thing was predicated off lies, all of it, obvious lies, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1623.86s)]
*  just like the war in Iraq, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1628.06s)]
*  just like the same way that people can't defend the war in Iraq today, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1629.26s)]
*  it's the same goddamn thing. How can you defend something? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1632.26s)]
*  When the whole thing was predicated off what are now obvious lies that [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1634.94s)]
*  lockdowns were predicated on 15 days to slow the spread. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1638.5800000000002s)]
*  And then they went into months and months and months of lockdowns. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1642.1000000000001s)]
*  That's not 15 days to slow the spread. That's bullshit. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1644.7s)]
*  And the vaccine was predicated on the ultimate vaccine lie, which was what, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1647.38s)]
*  if you, if you take it, you can't get it. You can't spread it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1652.7s)]
*  It's what they all said, including this liar up there. And so like, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1655.46s)]
*  it's how can you look back at that and still defend it? It just makes no sense. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1659.38s)]
*  All right guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1663.86s)]
*  which is my Patriot supply. We're in crunch time right now. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1667.18s)]
*  A new administration will be sworn in soon, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1670.78s)]
*  but who knows what could happen in the meantime. If you're anything like me, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1673.46s)]
*  no matter what's going on in the world, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1678.1s)]
*  you want to know that you're as prepared as you possibly can be. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1679.74s)]
*  And that's why I have emergency food supply from my Patriot supply right now. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1683.34s)]
*  They're offering a hundred dollars off their three month emergency food kit. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1688.14s)]
*  It's got 2000 calories per day for three whole months, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1692.2199999999998s)]
*  plenty to get you through even a prolonged emergency. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1695.86s)]
*  And all of their food kits last up to 25 years in storage. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1699.02s)]
*  They come in rugged weatherproof buckets. Go check them out at my site, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1703.5s)]
*  prepare with smith.com right now to order your three month emergency [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1707.58s)]
*  food kit. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1712.54s)]
*  I've got emergency food supplies in my home because the safety of my family and [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1713.3s)]
*  security is the most important priority to me. You should be that way too. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1717.62s)]
*  Go to prepare with smith.com to order your three month emergency food kit now. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1721.6999999999998s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. All right, let's see. If you guys, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1726.6999999999998s)]
*  by the way, if you want to ask some questions, I do have the chat open so we can [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1730.78s)]
*  come to that. There was, there was another clip [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1733.9799999999998s)]
*  of Dr. Wynn that was also fairly interesting, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1739.86s)]
*  specifically talking about Bobby Kennedy. So let's play that one. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1742.6599999999999s)]
*  What level of concern do you have about some of the people appointed by [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1748.4199999999998s)]
*  President-elect Trump to incoming public health positions regarding issues of [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1751.38s)]
*  vaccine testing, public health efficacy? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1756.0200000000002s)]
*  I think that there are some people coming into this administration who are very [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1759.94s)]
*  competent. For example, Dr. Marty McCary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1763.98s)]
*  We have worked together for the last 10 plus years on issues like hospital [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1767.8600000000001s)]
*  medical error. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1771.38s)]
*  He's an independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1772.5400000000002s)]
*  change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1777.18s)]
*  But I have a lot of concern and I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1780.82s)]
*  public health. And I think all of us share this concern in particular about [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1784.14s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of health and human services. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1787.58s)]
*  Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1793.14s)]
*  In fact, he's been one of the leading anti-vaccine advocates in the country, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1797.54s)]
*  if not in the world over the last couple of decades. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1801.46s)]
*  He's also someone who has made his career from being an activist and not a [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1804.06s)]
*  scientist. And what I mean is that if you're a scientist, even if you have [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1808.78s)]
*  deeply held convictions, you should be willing to change your mind if there are [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1812.34s)]
*  new facts that are presented. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1816.22s)]
*  It's a fact that childhood vaccines are safe and they are life saving. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1817.8999999999999s)]
*  A CDC analysis just now found that the childhood vaccinations have saved over [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1822.3799999999999s)]
*  1.1 million children's lives over the last 20 years. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1827.18s)]
*  According to a Lancet study, childhood vaccines saved 154 million lives globally [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1830.82s)]
*  over the last 50 years. I mean, these are facts. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1835.94s)]
*  And it's very concerning to have someone who doesn't believe in the in how science [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1838.42s)]
*  works in basic scientific principles to be in charge of our nation's preeminent [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1843.7s)]
*  scientific and medical agencies. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1848.5s)]
*  All right. What can you say, Rob, other than what a great endorsement for Bobby [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1850.66s)]
*  Kennedy? Well, you and what credibility? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1854.58s)]
*  Now, I'm not I don't know that I agree with Bobby Kennedy on all the vaccine stuff. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1858.5s)]
*  It's not my topic of expertise. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1864.18s)]
*  I and and there's things that I've read from him or I'm like, I don't know about [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1866.38s)]
*  that. But he did get covid right. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1870.9s)]
*  And you guys got all wrong. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1874.06s)]
*  So when you go, hey, all the people that got this whole thing wrong don't think [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1875.7s)]
*  that that's a good idea. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1878.74s)]
*  You and what credibility? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1879.94s)]
*  Because the scoreboard says one nothing right now. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1881.26s)]
*  Yeah. So who are you? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1884.18s)]
*  Who are you to criticize? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1886.26s)]
*  Did the nerve to say, oh, you don't learn when new evidence is presented to you? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1887.5s)]
*  I mean, dude, go people out there if you haven't already go read Tom Wood's book [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1892.6599999999999s)]
*  Diary of a Psychosis and the thing that's so infuriating about it, which again, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1897.1399999999999s)]
*  it it was like a religious experience reading this book. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1901.94s)]
*  It's so good. I highly recommend it. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1905.46s)]
*  But especially for somebody who like me and you who did a show through the thing [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1907.26s)]
*  like what starts bringing you back because it's in chronological order. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1911.86s)]
*  So he goes starting in March of 2020 and then goes through the whole thing. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1916.78s)]
*  And as you're you're reading it, you're like, oh, yeah, that's right. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1920.14s)]
*  We knew that by June. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1924.8200000000002s)]
*  And yet here we are. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1927.1000000000001s)]
*  And the more you read the book, the more infuriated you get because you get to a point [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1928.26s)]
*  like once you get to like July of 2020, you're like, it's got to be over now. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1932.5800000000002s)]
*  Right. And you're like, oh, my God, I'm not even a third of the way through the book yet. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1937.46s)]
*  You know, and you're like, and then they just keep going on. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1941.3000000000002s)]
*  And that would be the thing that was so infuriating. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1943.5s)]
*  There's like some new information would come out. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1945.9s)]
*  It would change the way you should look at this completely. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1947.86s)]
*  And then the corporate media for two more years just pretended like none of it came out. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1950.26s)]
*  So the nerve of her to sit here and say like that science. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1954.02s)]
*  This is a real look, I think, as a lot of people kind of have noticed during Covid. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1958.62s)]
*  But, you know, I think this is a much broader theme of our show in general. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1966.1799999999998s)]
*  But it's certainly true when it comes to science is that, you know, OK, there's science. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1971.06s)]
*  And then there's what people call science, which an awful lot of the time looks a lot like religion. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1977.82s)]
*  You know, and when you're when you're seeing what's it called? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1985.4199999999998s)]
*  What were the things the way people would like Deify Fauci? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1990.5s)]
*  And like there were the people who were like building the shrines to him. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1996.3s)]
*  If you remember early during Covid or that they were Cuomo [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=1999.6599999999999s)]
*  sexuals, they would call them because Andrew Cuomo was so hot or something like that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2002.58s)]
*  That's this doesn't feel too sciency to me. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2009.3s)]
*  This feels a lot more like a religion. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2012.78s)]
*  And that's, you know, when she talks about like the way she's saying, first of all, that Bobby Kennedy rejects science. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2014.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, look, whether or not Bobby Kennedy is right about all of his views, which I'm kind of like you. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2023.18s)]
*  I'm not convinced. And I've heard him say some stuff before. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2029.06s)]
*  I was like, that doesn't sound right to me. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2031.34s)]
*  And I don't really know enough about the wider vaccine conversation to have a strong opinion on it. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2032.7s)]
*  But it's just not true that Bobby Kennedy is coming out and saying, I am against the scientific method or I am against research or I am against. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2039.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, he's not questioning the foundational views of science. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2049.3s)]
*  He's saying I have a different interpretation of the science than you have. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2054.3s)]
*  And I believe that this is actually the correct. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2058.06s)]
*  You guys suppressed all information and debate during Covid. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2059.78s)]
*  So how dare you step forward and go, well, we have the scientific process. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2062.5s)]
*  No, you didn't. You had I am the lord of science. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2066.3s)]
*  And that's why you're not allowed to even question this. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2068.9s)]
*  And if you do, we will remove your information from the Internet. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2071.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, also, it looks and I will say, and this is part of the reason why I'm really thrilled that Jay Bhattacharya, who was heroic through Covid, is going to be at the NIH, assuming everybody gets confirmed. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2074.2200000000003s)]
*  This is one of the things that I kind of learned or I don't know if I say learned, but he really helped me with during during the Covid years. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2084.98s)]
*  Was that he was the one who would cut. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2094.46s)]
*  And by the way, Jay Bhattacharya, I think was I'd have to go back and read some of his stuff, but I don't think he was ever as radical as me or you were like. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2096.46s)]
*  And he wasn't even like saying like, oh, my God, this, you know, the, you know, I think he he was kind of making the argument that like the vaccine was good. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2103.34s)]
*  But it was totally oversold and it probably should have just been to these like targeted groups or something like that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2112.8999999999996s)]
*  But he would point out often when like these studies would come out and he would go, listen, Fauci and these guys, they're totally overplaying their hand here. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2119.62s)]
*  Like if you're really being like a scientist about that, you would talk about this study in this way and not talk about it as if it was like a concrete, perfect thing. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2131.9s)]
*  And look, she does it right there. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2142.6600000000003s)]
*  She cites a study that says that that whatever the number of kids was saved, the numbers aren't even impressive. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2144.6200000000003s)]
*  I take that back. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2152.46s)]
*  I take that back. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2155.1s)]
*  One hundred fifty million people worldwide is impressive. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2155.7400000000002s)]
*  However, I'm sure that's against models for absolute worst case scenarios. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2158.86s)]
*  And then doesn't it doesn't account for the fact that from what I've seen, viruses do have a fall off because they kill off enough people. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2162.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes. So like I'm sure their projections are worst case scenario and ongoing. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2169.86s)]
*  But the number was a million people. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2174.18s)]
*  I think I heard in the US, which that's not that impressive of a number. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2177.1s)]
*  Well, over the course of 50 years, you saved a million people. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2182.02s)]
*  Well, even but look, the thing about it is, is that number one, OK, you could look into the study and I'm sure there could be experts who could pick apart the study and say, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2184.5s)]
*  this is something that Jay Bhattacharya did on a few different podcasts that I listened to during covid, which was very helpful for me to understanding the stuff, because he would he would take a study and he'd be like, look, here's the claim that Hotez is making. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2192.7000000000003s)]
*  Hotez is making the claim that the vaccine would have saved this many more lives if more people had taken it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2205.2200000000003s)]
*  But here's the reason why you can't actually get that from this study and kind of breaking it down. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2210.74s)]
*  But just I'm specifically talking about the difference between science and religion and the way she goes, she goes, she mentions a study that goes this study found that a million children were saved by these vaccines. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2214.8999999999996s)]
*  And then she goes, that's just a fact. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2228.66s)]
*  That's not how science works, man. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2231.7s)]
*  And that's not how scientists should ever be talking with. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2233.58s)]
*  If you have a study that one study that indicates this many people were saved, you know, all of these models are always very difficult to to be completely accurate. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2236.62s)]
*  The way a scientist would talk about that would be to say, would be to say, OK, this study argues that this many people were saved by it. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2247.22s)]
*  I think this was a very good study for these reasons. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2258.3399999999997s)]
*  And so that would certainly indicate that there might be some real benefit to these things. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2261.9s)]
*  OK, that's how a scientist would talk about. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2266.5s)]
*  And this is one of the things Jay Bhattacharya made the point. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2268.46s)]
*  He's like, if you get a study like this, the way a scientist should talk about this would be to say this was a big study. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2270.1s)]
*  Here's why I think it was a very good study. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2276.3s)]
*  Here's why I think they did the right, you know, like their methodology was correct. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2278.58s)]
*  And then this study would indicate that there's probably value here. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2283.66s)]
*  You don't just go, they said this number, that's a fact. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2288.14s)]
*  That's the sloppiest shit ever. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2291.74s)]
*  We never do that, dude. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2293.54s)]
*  When there's a study that confirms our bias, you never just go and therefore that's a fact that this study got it 100 percent right. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2295.06s)]
*  And the reason why she's saying that is not for a scientific reason, it's for a political reason. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2303.94s)]
*  It's so that she because she wants to say vaccines are great because that's the industry that she's in. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2308.82s)]
*  But it's like that's just not a lot of times. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2315.34s)]
*  And this was something that was really evident during covid. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2317.38s)]
*  You could pick up on just almost like the language patterns and go like you're not doing science right now because that's not actually the way a scientist would talk. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2321.8599999999997s)]
*  And there's a lot. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2329.74s)]
*  There's a lot of like really bullshit pseudoscience that's out there. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2331.06s)]
*  And it doesn't mean you reject science to recognize that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2336.14s)]
*  I, you know, the I always pick on this because kind of low hanging fruit. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2339.2599999999998s)]
*  But it's like the happiness studies and then they'll pretend that that's science. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2343.7s)]
*  They'll be like, we found out that the happiest people fit this demographic. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2348.82s)]
*  And you're like, how did you do that? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2352.7000000000003s)]
*  What's the methodology here? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2354.0600000000004s)]
*  And you're like, we asked them. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2355.1800000000003s)]
*  We said, rate yourself on a scale of one to five. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2357.46s)]
*  How happy are you? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2359.6600000000003s)]
*  And you're like, oh, but that's like asking. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2360.9s)]
*  It's like if I did a study on honesty and I was like, these people are the most honest because they say so. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2363.0600000000004s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but that doesn't really control for whether they're being honest or not. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2368.1800000000003s)]
*  There's just a lot of junk science out there. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2371.54s)]
*  And and I think this is a good example of it. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2373.9s)]
*  All right, let's see. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2379.3s)]
*  All right. Let's keep you know what? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2383.34s)]
*  Let's let's move on. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2385.5s)]
*  Let's go to that other clip that you had up before, Natalie, because I did find that one to be just glorious. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2386.6200000000003s)]
*  It's kind of on the theme that the broader theme of. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2392.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, post mortems out of the corporate media of the last few months and the last few years, I guess. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2398.26s)]
*  And it has been, you know, it's fascinating to see them trying. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2405.1000000000004s)]
*  Trying so hard to deal with the elephant in the room. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2410.42s)]
*  And yeah, I did. I found this fascinating. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2416.5400000000004s)]
*  Let's play the clip and then we can we can discuss. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2418.5s)]
*  It was very disturbing to learn late in the year about just how bad, how poor his health has become. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2421.0600000000004s)]
*  And like many, I did not realize that it had gotten to that point. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2429.2200000000003s)]
*  That being said, I think he's still if he showed up for the job, he got the work done. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2433.2599999999998s)]
*  I think some of the accomplishments also in the Middle East informed policy. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2438.06s)]
*  He pause already. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2441.66s)]
*  Stand the test. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2442.4599999999996s)]
*  Just even the contradictions in right now, she doesn't want to say dementia. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2443.66s)]
*  She wants to say poor health. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2446.8999999999996s)]
*  Yes. And then even though I guess he's mentally incapacitated, he still got the job done. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2448.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, how did he get the job done? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2453.9399999999996s)]
*  And then why were you concerned with his dementia? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2455.22s)]
*  Because if at the end of the day, he's getting the job done. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2457.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, what are we concerned with here? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2460.2999999999997s)]
*  And then if you're going to say, oh, well, we're first finding out about this dimension, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2462.8999999999996s)]
*  it's troubling to hear that it was as much of a problem as it is. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2467.06s)]
*  Why isn't he being removed from office right now? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2470.4599999999996s)]
*  In other words, there's some mental inconsistency that you have to have in terms of addressing this Joe Biden problem, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2474.8199999999997s)]
*  which is I was talking about this on run your mouth. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2481.4599999999996s)]
*  They put out the long Wall Street Journal article about essentially. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2483.74s)]
*  They didn't get into too many new juicy details, but it was just essentially, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2488.8199999999997s)]
*  hey, this guy's been mentally incapacitated and they've been covering for him. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2492.18s)]
*  And they keep referring to the White House as almost the White House is its own entity. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2495.54s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like, well, who is the White House? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2499.8999999999996s)]
*  An actual person does it talk? Is it making decisions? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2502.62s)]
*  Who was making the decision? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2505.66s)]
*  Oh, no, it's been true for the entire Biden administration where they would. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2506.8199999999997s)]
*  Biden would say something and then they would say the White House clarified [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2511.2999999999997s)]
*  that actually his statement is not like the House. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2515.74s)]
*  I mean, really important things. Yeah. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2517.8199999999997s)]
*  Like really like things like the example that's come into my mind is that he was in one interview. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2519.5s)]
*  This was a couple of years ago where he they he was asked if [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2523.18s)]
*  China moved on Taiwan, would the US military intervene? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2528.7s)]
*  And he goes, yes, yes, we would, because Joe Biden's just ad lib and he don't know nothing. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2533.98s)]
*  And he doesn't know that he's completely contradicting the one China policy, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2539.62s)]
*  which has been the policy of the United States of America since the 1970s. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2542.86s)]
*  We are on record saying Taiwan is part of China. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2546.7s)]
*  China is allowed to do what they want to do to Taiwan. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2549.62s)]
*  However, and actually, this is one of the few areas of American foreign policy [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2552.18s)]
*  where it's actually a wise decision, because the thinking was from much smarter [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2557.1s)]
*  people than anyone in office today, not that they were good people, but they were much smarter. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2562.06s)]
*  The thinking was just like, look, we can't really do anything about it anyway. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2566.7s)]
*  So we're just going to say we recognize China's right to rule over Taiwan. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2571.14s)]
*  But we sure would like it if you didn't mess with them. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2574.9s)]
*  OK, and then the understanding has been that if America was to ever say, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2578.94s)]
*  well, no, Taiwan isn't yours and you're not allowed to invade, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2583.78s)]
*  that might be the type of thing that may might make China invade just to prove that they can. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2588.2200000000003s)]
*  So we were, in other words, doing what we should have done with Ukraine, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2592.86s)]
*  which is that you recognize there's a special relationship in this country [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2598.42s)]
*  with China, you know, even back in the day, by the way, I said the wiser people who were in government. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2603.5s)]
*  But what's his name? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2607.7s)]
*  Henry Kissinger. Sorry, blanking there for a second. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2612.18s)]
*  Henry Kissinger, who I am. No, Henry Kissinger. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2614.4199999999996s)]
*  Let's be clear. Sam Harris was right. I am not him. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2617.7s)]
*  But he was a big advocate for NATO expansion in the 90s. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2620.98s)]
*  You know, when there was the first round of NATO expansion, there was a big debate [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2624.98s)]
*  within the national security apparatus over whether we should expand or not. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2628.46s)]
*  He was one of the guys who was like, yes, we should expand. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2631.74s)]
*  But even he said, obviously, Ukraine is a special example, is like a special case. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2634.34s)]
*  So like we can expand NATO, we can do that and get away with it. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2640.5s)]
*  But obviously not to Ukraine. So like Ukraine, we have to work out our own. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2644.1s)]
*  Anyway, it's not really neither here nor there. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2647.38s)]
*  But the point is that so Joe Biden in this interview just says, and then later that day, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2650.42s)]
*  the White House puts out a statement and goes, Joe Biden was incorrect. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2655.54s)]
*  Our position is still the one China policy. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2660.38s)]
*  And it does leave you asking your question, who who at the White House can outrank [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2663.02s)]
*  the president of the United States of America? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2667.34s)]
*  Like, I'm just kind of curious who wrote this, because as you said, Rob, it's not [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2669.1800000000003s)]
*  the House itself, right? So is it Jake Sullivan? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2672.6600000000003s)]
*  Is it Jill Biden? We all know it's not Kamala Harris. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2675.94s)]
*  So like who the fuck is actually put anyway? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2678.98s)]
*  We to this woman's point here. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2681.34s)]
*  First of all, it is just I understand the situation you're in is like you're [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2684.58s)]
*  a five year old kid and the dad comes downstairs and turns the lights on. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2691.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's just a mess of cookie crumbs [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2697.18s)]
*  everywhere and your hand is in the cookie jar and there's chocolate all over your face. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2699.38s)]
*  And now you're sitting there and you're going, did you eat all these cookies? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2704.74s)]
*  And you're going. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2707.54s)]
*  OK, hear me out. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2709.62s)]
*  What had happened? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2711.2999999999997s)]
*  And now you're just you're desperate in a situation where you admit the truth [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2712.54s)]
*  and you're and you're toast, but there's no lie that you could come up with. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2716.58s)]
*  But to sit here and I must admit, I take what's the German word? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2721.1s)]
*  I take some pleasure in a Schopenfreude. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2725.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2727.98s)]
*  What the fuck word was that? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2728.86s)]
*  It's it's you've never heard that Schadenfreude. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2729.98s)]
*  I'm sorry. You've never as a Jew. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2733.22s)]
*  You've never heard that term before. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2735.22s)]
*  It means like taking delight in the suffering of others. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2736.74s)]
*  Sounds German. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2739.62s)]
*  It sure is. They perfected it. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2740.58s)]
*  So. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2744.5s)]
*  I am I am taking some delight in her suffering, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2746.62s)]
*  but she can't she can't admit this. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2749.46s)]
*  But so now she's just left in this [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2751.82s)]
*  situation where she's actually has to say, when I discovered at the end of the year. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2755.1s)]
*  This year, at the end of the year, when we [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2763.9s)]
*  discovered how bad Joe Biden's health issues are and like, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2767.34s)]
*  I mean, I just don't what can you even say of this? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2773.7s)]
*  Imagine that because they're just constantly in the business of trying to, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2775.74s)]
*  like, construct a narrative that has nothing to do with the truth. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2780.62s)]
*  But imagine, like, trying to tell anyone, any thinking person who's got a [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2785.9799999999996s)]
*  functioning brain, and I don't mean like a high IQ person. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2791.74s)]
*  I just mean somebody whose brain works. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2794.8199999999997s)]
*  How can you convince anyone that you just found out that we're supposed to believe [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2797.1s)]
*  essentially, Rob, that the sharp is attack thing was true [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2801.62s)]
*  and that the debate with Trump was the moment when Joe Biden started to [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2806.66s)]
*  cognitively suffer, but everything before that was fine. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2812.1s)]
*  We're actually supposed to believe that anybody paying attention to this just [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2816.02s)]
*  found out late this year that Joe Biden is senile and hasn't known that for at least [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2821.2599999999998s)]
*  four years. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2827.86s)]
*  Part of that, we were distracted by cheap fakes. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2829.22s)]
*  And how can we possibly get this story right? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2831.98s)]
*  I mean, it really is. It's just unbelievable. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2834.54s)]
*  And it's like, no, we all knew this for a very long time, including you. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2837.2599999999998s)]
*  You lied through your teeth about it. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2842.54s)]
*  And the only thing you're disturbed about is that everyone figured that out. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2845.02s)]
*  And then ultimately you lost very badly. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2848.66s)]
*  Here, let's keep playing the clip. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2851.86s)]
*  Time, you think the Middle East is in better shape today than when he took office? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2856.06s)]
*  Well, I think I'm sorry, pause it, pause it there. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2861.1s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2863.9s)]
*  Sorry, because I completely forgot that she also bragged about the Middle East. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2865.22s)]
*  She goes, he kept showing up to the job and he got the work done. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2868.82s)]
*  So even though, like, as you kind of pointed out, Rob, right, even though there's [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2873.02s)]
*  this clear contradiction, it's like you were really disturbed to find this out [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2876.54s)]
*  late last year. But hey, he still showed up and got the job done. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2880.42s)]
*  So why are you disturbed then? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2883.1s)]
*  Yeah, why are you ankle injury? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2884.5s)]
*  If you still win and you show up and you get the job done, I don't care. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2886.38s)]
*  Yeah. So like, what's the issue then? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2889.46s)]
*  Why were you disturbed to find out late in the year that Joe Biden is a vegetable? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2891.3s)]
*  So you found that late and then you're going to go, but he still got the job done. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2896.9s)]
*  And this is what's remarkable to me is that they can they can actually say, I mean, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2899.86s)]
*  I guess if you could say that first part, you could say the second part. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2904.78s)]
*  But you could say with a straight face that Joe Biden's record of achievement [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2907.2200000000003s)]
*  and point to the Middle East, the Middle East. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2911.7799999999997s)]
*  You guys familiar with that region in the world and what's going on there? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2916.2999999999997s)]
*  Like broadly, you're just like loosely familiar with what's going on there. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2919.3799999999997s)]
*  You would be like, oh, yeah, things are great. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2923.14s)]
*  Things are great. Cannibals are cutting people's heads off in Syria. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2925.4199999999996s)]
*  Is it fucking, you know, the [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2929.8199999999997s)]
*  was it Israel's been bombing the shit out of Gaza for well over a year now? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2933.58s)]
*  You've got the Houthis getting involved in the war. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2939.7s)]
*  You've got Hezbollah in Lebanon involved in the war now. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2942.34s)]
*  Where is this success in the Middle East? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2947.58s)]
*  What is what is one success story in the Middle East? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2950.38s)]
*  They don't have one. Anyway, let's keep going. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2953.74s)]
*  I'm sorry, which hostages he got, he's gotten a number of people home. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2957.86s)]
*  There's still a hundred people over there. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2961.78s)]
*  Well, there were more including some Americans. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2963.18s)]
*  Look, I think he's going to I think he's going to leave office in disgrace. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2965.14s)]
*  The Hunter Biden pardon was disgraceful. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2969.02s)]
*  He's going to be remembered largely for inflation [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2971.02s)]
*  and for the disastrous Afghanistan pullout. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2973.82s)]
*  And I think as we continue to we're just getting the first draft of this now. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2976.74s)]
*  But as we continue to learn about the massive cover up that went on, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2980.06s)]
*  not about his health, but about his mental acuity to cover that up, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2984.86s)]
*  the efforts that were undertaken by the White House staff, by his family, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2989.54s)]
*  not in the last couple of months, but for all four years. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2993.86s)]
*  I think it's going to be a really ugly chapter. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2997.18s)]
*  It's a diminished presidency because of it. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=2999.74s)]
*  And I think we still don't know the full extent of what they did [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3002.8999999999996s)]
*  to try to hide what they've been doing over in the West Wing. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3006.8999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3010.22s)]
*  I it is worth pointing out that, of course, even on CNN, when they have like [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3010.98s)]
*  a Republican voice who sounds somewhat reasonable, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3016.3399999999997s)]
*  it's it's a George W. Bush Republican voice there. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3018.98s)]
*  And so, first of all, I do just have to say, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3021.58s)]
*  Joe Biden's to go inflation, number one, and then number two, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3025.06s)]
*  his Afghanistan pullout, I just don't think is right at all. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3030.34s)]
*  There's no question that it is pretty widely agreed that Joe Biden bungled [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3034.42s)]
*  the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and it was kind of a disaster. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3039.46s)]
*  It wasn't nearly as much of a disaster as the corporate media [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3043.14s)]
*  kind of likes to make it out to be. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3045.66s)]
*  But OK, he he messed up the the withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3047.34s)]
*  But I'm sorry. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3051.9799999999996s)]
*  Like to even put that as a no, no, no, no, no, no, no, my friend. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3053.06s)]
*  Say it with me now. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3057.4199999999996s)]
*  Inflation is number one. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3059.18s)]
*  And number two is immigration. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3060.8599999999997s)]
*  That's the other thing that Joe Biden is going to be remembered for the fact [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3063.3799999999997s)]
*  that for even by their own ridiculous defense, where they say, hey, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3066.7799999999997s)]
*  three and a half years later, we offered this bill and Donald Trump [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3071.54s)]
*  tried to kill it and the bill was so great. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3075.1s)]
*  They could lie and pretend the bill was so great. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3076.9399999999996s)]
*  And that would have solved the problem. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3079.02s)]
*  It doesn't matter even by their own argument. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3080.86s)]
*  For three and a half years, you sat there while record breaking border [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3084.1400000000003s)]
*  crossings were occurring and did nothing about it and then just tried to tell [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3089.06s)]
*  the American people it wasn't really a problem. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3092.94s)]
*  You tried to tell them that inflation was transitory [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3095.02s)]
*  and that the economy was great and all of this stuff. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3097.6600000000003s)]
*  You lied through your teeth. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3100.1800000000003s)]
*  But he is look, he is absolutely right that [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3101.26s)]
*  and it's not so much about the Biden administration. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3105.1800000000003s)]
*  It is the the media's Emperor's new clothes game that they tried to play [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3108.14s)]
*  with Joe Biden and convincing as she's still participating in trying to convince [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3115.4199999999996s)]
*  everybody that it was just late this year. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3119.8199999999997s)]
*  You see, it was just when we could no longer deny that he was so obviously senile. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3122.9399999999996s)]
*  That's when it started. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3128.66s)]
*  It's like that is going to look, as I as I've been saying for quite a while, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3130.1s)]
*  that is just an enormous death blow to the corporate media. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3135.58s)]
*  And that's what these guys are going to really struggle to ever recover from. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3140.46s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3144.02s)]
*  which is Crowd Health. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3147.06s)]
*  Does anyone love their health insurance carrier? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3148.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't hear any yeses. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3152.06s)]
*  I assume that much like me, none of you do. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3153.5s)]
*  That's because politicians and big hospitals, big pharma, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3156.54s)]
*  big health insurance companies make a huge profit off keeping the system broken. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3160.54s)]
*  But now there is an alternative and that is Crowd Health, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3165.6200000000003s)]
*  a decentralized health care payment system that frees you from the tyranny [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3168.98s)]
*  of health insurance. You can go to whatever doctor you'd like to. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3173.7400000000002s)]
*  There are no networks. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3176.98s)]
*  It's significantly less expensive than health insurance. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3178.1800000000003s)]
*  First, it rips out the bureaucracy of the middlemen. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3181.06s)]
*  Some say it's upwards of 40 percent of the costs. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3183.9s)]
*  Second, the people who have gathered at join health take personal responsibility [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3186.5s)]
*  over their health care, and that means they take better care of themselves. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3190.86s)]
*  Singles are just one hundred and eighty five dollars a month. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3194.54s)]
*  A family of four is six hundred and five dollars a month. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3197.14s)]
*  And now you can use the promo code POTP to get just ninety nine dollars [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3200.14s)]
*  a month per person for the next three months. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3205.1s)]
*  Crowd Health is not health insurance. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3208.18s)]
*  It's a totally different way of paying for health care. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3209.98s)]
*  Terms and conditions may apply. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3212.26s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3228.02s)]
*  I hope we get more stories about what was actually going on behind the scenes [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3231.3799999999997s)]
*  and how bad his dementia was, where his balls were out, even trying to eat [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3234.74s)]
*  his shoes, just like I want. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3238.8199999999997s)]
*  I want the real dirt of just how bad the dementia was. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3240.66s)]
*  And my guess is we'll get some coverage of that at some point, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3243.34s)]
*  because you always find out the stuff after the fact. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3247.06s)]
*  Like suddenly the pictures emerge of Biden taking pictures with the exact Chinese [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3249.1400000000003s)]
*  the business partners of of hunters that he never he never met [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3255.54s)]
*  and never had a conversation with, which conveniently he'll be pledging [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3259.6600000000003s)]
*  the dementia defense all day. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3263.38s)]
*  I don't remember that. And we'll actually believe him. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3265.34s)]
*  I listen. Joe Biden could say, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3267.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't remember that to any question, and I will probably believe him. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3272.14s)]
*  I will probably believe him. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3276.54s)]
*  I said I was joking around about this in my act for a little bit. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3277.8199999999997s)]
*  But it's one of the frustrating things with Joe Biden is it doesn't matter [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3281.66s)]
*  how how evil someone was. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3285.42s)]
*  Once you have dementia, there is no satisfying revenge. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3288.06s)]
*  You know, if you if you like found some old, you know, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3292.5s)]
*  I mean, I guess it's we're too old and we're living in the future now. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3295.7799999999997s)]
*  So probably there there's no more of them. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3298.46s)]
*  But like if you found some like like Nazi who committed horrific, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3300.58s)]
*  you know, atrocities during that, but they were like 95 and senile, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3304.62s)]
*  would be no it wouldn't be satisfying to like see justice get served. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3309.14s)]
*  The stories are not that far off. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3314.14s)]
*  There was maybe a year or two ago they were prosecuting some guy [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3315.8199999999997s)]
*  who was working at Auschwitz and you see some old guy in Korea like just [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3318.94s)]
*  well, what's the point of day? Whatever. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3322.14s)]
*  You got away with it, buddy. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3323.98s)]
*  And I know for you, you know, I need the 94 year old to go to jail. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3325.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it's just there's nothing satisfying about it. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3329.58s)]
*  And look, I mean, it's it's been. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3332.46s)]
*  Well, what's satisfying is if they actually break the story, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3335.86s)]
*  even if it's a no fault prosecution and not one of these bullshit [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3338.7000000000003s)]
*  investigation things that are actually cover ups. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3342.54s)]
*  But if we could actually name the names of who is covering up for him, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3345.1s)]
*  who you know what I mean? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3348.94s)]
*  That that's where you have to actually cleanse the machine a little bit [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3349.9s)]
*  of its ability to lie to us. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3354.26s)]
*  Yes. And that's actually holding the people who facilitated it accountable. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3356.6200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, bitching out the media when you get actual [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3361.82s)]
*  reporting about what was going on behind the scenes and you go, my God, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3365.94s)]
*  how did the media not report on this? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3369.46s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's that's exactly right. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3371.82s)]
*  And and it's a that is the big, you know, because look, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3373.9s)]
*  I mean, whatever I saw in the chat said, it would be a little satisfying. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3378.54s)]
*  OK, I get your point. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3381.46s)]
*  But that is the the bigger, you know, picture here [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3382.7799999999997s)]
*  is the comment on the media and all of those guys who are still there. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3387.18s)]
*  Like they're you're still there. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3391.4199999999996s)]
*  You're supposed you're supposed to be covering the news [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3392.8199999999997s)]
*  and getting the truth out to people. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3396.02s)]
*  And you couldn't even trust you to point out that the sitting president [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3397.74s)]
*  of the United States of America has like his pants on his head. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3401.66s)]
*  You can't even like you can't let the American people know that. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3405.54s)]
*  And more than that, that we see it, too. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3408.8599999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, look, there are things like, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3411.42s)]
*  you know, famously, and I don't actually know that much about this, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3414.58s)]
*  but I do know that. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3417.5s)]
*  What's it called? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3422.34s)]
*  So the FDR hid his polio from the country, right? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3422.9s)]
*  Like they didn't know he couldn't walk and he would you would see this [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3427.2599999999998s)]
*  where he would come around like in a car and they had like a rigged car for him [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3430.82s)]
*  that he could drive like with his canes or whatever. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3434.86s)]
*  But he'd come around in a car and take the picture from his car. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3437.46s)]
*  We were an honest country that wouldn't trust a cripple. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3439.78s)]
*  I wanted a real man who could walk. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3443.02s)]
*  And I didn't care how smart he was and how into wealth redistribution was. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3445.0600000000004s)]
*  If that guy stuck in a wheelchair, he can't be my leader. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3448.42s)]
*  That was a better country. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3451.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh, dude, and fucking and God bless his manliness that he lied. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3452.5s)]
*  Did you imagine? And I got perfectly good legs. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3455.98s)]
*  Can you imagine in 1932, though, just like how they would have dealt with the guy? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3458.1000000000004s)]
*  You go, he's got the retard legs. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3461.38s)]
*  You're telling me I'm supposed to vote for this guy? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3463.0600000000004s)]
*  What type of moron are you? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3465.7000000000003s)]
*  But, you know, but anyway, so he hid that. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3468.7400000000002s)]
*  Now, I'd imagine there must have been people in the press corps who knew [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3470.86s)]
*  about that, but they didn't tell anyone. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3474.9s)]
*  OK, look, at least fine. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3477.94s)]
*  You could find a way with 1932 technology to not tell anyone that were 1932. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3482.1400000000003s)]
*  I think that's when FDR came in in 1932. Right. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3487.94s)]
*  Yeah. OK. So, OK. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3490.46s)]
*  With the technology of the early 30s, you could not tell anyone. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3492.98s)]
*  If they didn't have a picture of it, fine. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3496.42s)]
*  But that's a different thing than like if you were to show a picture of it [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3497.98s)]
*  and then tell them that he can walk just fine. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3502.82s)]
*  Like if you were just watching him walk on crutches and then get into a wheelchair [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3505.6600000000003s)]
*  and you'd be like, oh, I don't think he can walk. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3509.38s)]
*  And they make he walks just fine. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3510.78s)]
*  What are you some type of right winger? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3512.1s)]
*  He walks just fine. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3513.86s)]
*  Like that's what they were doing with Joe Biden, trying to tell us that he walks. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3514.7400000000002s)]
*  And part of it is because of, you know, who these people are, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3518.78s)]
*  who are in the corporate media. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3522.1800000000003s)]
*  Before we wrap up today, let's play the Don Lemon video [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3523.9s)]
*  because on the topic of who these people are, that really and I do not know. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3526.42s)]
*  Robbie, you sent this to me. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3531.1400000000003s)]
*  I do not know the context of this. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3532.42s)]
*  You told me you don't know the context of it either. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3533.82s)]
*  Seems like we thought it was AI at first. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3535.7000000000003s)]
*  Evidently, it is not. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3538.54s)]
*  But here is old Don Lemon of former CNN fame [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3540.2200000000003s)]
*  making videos on the Internet being Don Lemon. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3545.6200000000003s)]
*  And being out, you dumb fucking idiots. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3550.6600000000003s)]
*  Now you're just figuring this shit out. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3553.1s)]
*  You're so fucking stupid and you deserve it. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3555.8199999999997s)]
*  You fucking deserve it because you're so dumb. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3558.7s)]
*  Jim, it's hypocrisy. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3562.38s)]
*  So go with me here. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3563.74s)]
*  Yes, I am gloating over your stupidity and how you were taken. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3564.66s)]
*  Con I'm cracking. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3569.62s)]
*  I'm cackling in Kamala. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3571.2999999999997s)]
*  In Shanta, I am. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3573.94s)]
*  You're you've been co-opted because you're in a fucking cult [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3576.9s)]
*  and you don't even realize it because you have stupid [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3581.86s)]
*  mega brain and you don't get it. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3584.34s)]
*  How stupid and dumb are you? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3586.7000000000003s)]
*  And I'm just going to let I can't wait to go through this. OK. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3589.1800000000003s)]
*  So I'm going to read this again. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3593.2200000000003s)]
*  So Christian's appointment triggered an anti-Indian backlash on social media, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3594.54s)]
*  particularly given his past advocacy for increasing green cards [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3597.86s)]
*  and immigration fraud. Oh, no immigration. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3600.6600000000003s)]
*  We can't do the immigration. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3604.2200000000003s)]
*  That's my favorite part. Yes, to adjust his turtleneck. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3605.94s)]
*  Thank you. We can't do the immigration. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3608.8999999999996s)]
*  And so like a scuba because, you know, immigration, it triggers some people. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3611.7799999999997s)]
*  You know what they're saying about the anti-immigrant stuff, right? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3617.02s)]
*  Who's in to say that one of the jobs you might be seeking [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3622.3399999999997s)]
*  won't be one of those white jobs? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3624.98s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3629.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean, we get a gay translator. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3634.02s)]
*  You're a lesbian. Do you know what he was talking about? [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3636.86s)]
*  Gay to lesbian translation is very rough, Rob. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3639.82s)]
*  It's not an easy that's you need like a middleman in there. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3642.34s)]
*  Gays and lesbians are not natural allies. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3645.78s)]
*  They're the furthest on the spectrum apart from each other. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3647.5s)]
*  They're not. It's a whole different world. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3649.82s)]
*  But I don't know. I mean, what [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3652.6600000000003s)]
*  Don Lemon, he's just a fucking unhinged moron. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3656.1400000000003s)]
*  What else can you say about it? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3659.7400000000002s)]
*  But there is something, you know, I mentioned this to you before we started [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3660.86s)]
*  recording today, but there is one of the things that's very interesting [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3663.38s)]
*  about the divide between the old media and the new media [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3667.7000000000003s)]
*  is that the new media works in this very informal way. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3672.7000000000003s)]
*  There's just it's much more conversational and it's much more long form. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3680.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, that's not the case with everything. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3685.58s)]
*  I mean, there's also like TikTok videos and stuff like that. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3688.58s)]
*  But generally speaking, this new center of like podcasts, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3691.2999999999997s)]
*  internet shows, the alternative media, it's you do kind of [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3694.66s)]
*  you get to know the person. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3700.06s)]
*  You know, people always I get I get all the time. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3701.94s)]
*  People ask me like, oh, what's what's Joe Rogan really like? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3704.3799999999997s)]
*  What's Tucker Carlson really like when you like hang out with these guys? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3707.8999999999996s)]
*  I really always say to them, it goes like, you know, as much as me. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3711.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, I mean, I've hung out with these guys a lot more, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3714.7s)]
*  but they're the same person that you see. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3716.62s)]
*  Like, that's who they are. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3718.54s)]
*  And you do I do think I think if you listen to this show, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3719.94s)]
*  you get a sense of who we are. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3722.78s)]
*  Me and you having a conversation off air is not much different than me [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3724.54s)]
*  and you having a conversation on air. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3727.78s)]
*  There might be a couple of things that we'll say off air [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3729.2200000000003s)]
*  that would be like, I'm not going to say this on air, but blah, blah, blah. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3731.42s)]
*  But there's nothing that we wouldn't say privately that we say on air. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3734.46s)]
*  And there's it. Whereas the old media system, the CNN system, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3738.38s)]
*  it's all phony. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3743.82s)]
*  It's all designed so you never get a sense of who that person is. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3745.78s)]
*  It's all good evening and welcome to the eight o'clock news. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3748.98s)]
*  And, you know, it's this is this performance. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3752.02s)]
*  And it's interesting to see when Don Lemon goes to the Internet. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3755.14s)]
*  Oh, you actually get a little bit of a sense of who that guy is. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3759.78s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's the guy. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3762.58s)]
*  Just borderline retarded, brain dead, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3765.7s)]
*  cannot is insulting people and the only word he can come up with is stupid. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3770.02s)]
*  So he repeats stupid 17 times because he's got nothing else. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3773.98s)]
*  Absolute contempt for the American people, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3778.5s)]
*  at least the American people who supported the candidate he doesn't like. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3783.22s)]
*  And in on an unimaginable sense of superiority. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3786.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, like, that's just like what you see right from this guy [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3792.74s)]
*  telling you how stupid you are. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3795.02s)]
*  And what's his actual argument for why you're stupid? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3796.74s)]
*  The fact that MAGA voters feel betrayed by [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3799.7s)]
*  people in the MAGA orbit who are promoting immigration policies. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3804.5s)]
*  It's like, well, look, yeah, they voted against that. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3810.02s)]
*  They voted against [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3814.14s)]
*  prioritizing foreigners over Americans. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3817.22s)]
*  Now feel however you feel about that. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3819.66s)]
*  There's arguments on all sides of the immigration debate. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3821.54s)]
*  But make the argument and just tell people they're stupid [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3824.66s)]
*  for feeling betrayed on one of their core issues. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3828.58s)]
*  It's just it's appalling. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3832.1s)]
*  And what's what I love about the video is it does just show you. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3834.3s)]
*  And I think this is I think this is something that [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3837.34s)]
*  is right at the heart of why people love Donald Trump so much, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3840.46s)]
*  is that they people are not nearly as stupid as Don Lemon thinks they are. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3844.18s)]
*  And Don Lemon's a lot dumber than Don Lemon thinks he is. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3849.02s)]
*  And the truth is that this little moment right here, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3852.58s)]
*  like that sense of superiority that Don Lemon had, the contempt he has [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3856.1s)]
*  for what was the majority of the voting population of America, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3860.4199999999996s)]
*  they picked up on that. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3865.58s)]
*  They realized that you hate their guts and you think you're better than them [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3867.22s)]
*  because you wear like fancy turtlenecks and are like out, you know, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3871.3399999999997s)]
*  living wherever the hell or summering and wherever the hell [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3877.2599999999998s)]
*  Don Lemon summers with his white boyfriend. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3880.8999999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like you're just like, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3883.58s)]
*  you think you're better than all these people and you're fucking not. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3885.46s)]
*  That's why they hate your guts and their right to. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3888.82s)]
*  I don't know. Final word, I'll give it to you, Rob. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3892.42s)]
*  And then we got to wrap up. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3894.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, you got to be careful when you buy overpriced turtlenecks. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3897.02s)]
*  You start getting haughty. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3899.82s)]
*  That's really, I really got to watch out for that. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3902.26s)]
*  That'll be my downfall one day. Rob, this show has been going pretty good. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3903.94s)]
*  I think I'm going to get myself a fancy turtleneck. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3907.46s)]
*  The next thing you know, I'm an idiot and I think I'm better than everyone. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3909.98s)]
*  All right. That's it for our show today. Oh, I should mention before we leave, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3912.94s)]
*  I did have to reschedule our monthly zoom meeting from last Saturday. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3916.98s)]
*  This Saturday at 2 p.m. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3920.98s)]
*  I will be doing that for the people in the top two tiers. Do your thing, Rob. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3922.98s)]
*  Top two tiers this Saturday, 2 p.m. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ_cZauljFo&t=3926.86s)]
