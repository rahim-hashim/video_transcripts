# Dave Smith  Cuomo Fails Again  Part Of The Problem 1216
**Dave Smith - Part of the Problem:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA)
*  What's up, what's up? How is everybody doing? Welcome to a brand new episode of Part of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=0.0s)]
*  the Problem. I am Dave Smith. He is Robbie the Fire, Bernstein. How are you feeling, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=10.68s)]
*  brother? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=14.6s)]
*  I'm doing well. How are you, Mr. Smith? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=15.6s)]
*  Good, good. I cannot complain. Can I complain? A little bit of a busy morning here. I was [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  just recording with Aaron Matei and Katie Helper over on their podcast, which was great. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=22.64s)]
*  I really love those guys. So it was fun. It was cool. Who is Aaron? Aaron Matei. He's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=29.8s)]
*  a journalist. He wrote for the nation for a while. And then I want to hold on. Am I [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=36.6s)]
*  getting confused on this? I shouldn't say it wrong. But I think he's over at the you [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=43.16s)]
*  know, he is. Yes, he's at the gray zone now with like that's Max Blumenthal and Aaron [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=47.2s)]
*  Matei out there. He's a he's great. He was one of the absolute best journalists on Russiagate. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=53.76s)]
*  Just phenomenal. Like he's a left wing guy, but he was just totally all over that. Like, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=62.76s)]
*  look, this is just the most ridiculous thing ever that the CIA is saying. Trump's a Russian [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=68.08s)]
*  spy and did like great work on just tearing it apart, like going through each one of their [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=72.44s)]
*  claims and what the evidence was. So he was very helpful for me during that. He also did [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=77.2s)]
*  great reporting on on Syria back in like, I want to say like 2016, 2017, 2018 in those [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  years. Just great. So anyway, it was just a lot of fun to talk to talk with those guys. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  It was, I think, a very interesting conversation. So go look for that on their podcast. I am [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=92.56s)]
*  not sure what the name of it is, but I'll tweet it whenever it's out. I'll tweet it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, I brought my skis into the shop. I'm hoping that my legs hold up and going to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  be skiing out in Boozman. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=107.56s)]
*  Is well, if not, then you know how the Robbie the Fireburnstein story ends. It ends with a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=110.04s)]
*  tragic skiing incident where his knees were separated from his body. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=115.56s)]
*  And I hope not. But there is a possibility of hitting one mogul, retearing whatever I [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=120.36s)]
*  tore over the summer and then having to take the ski patrol down and sitting on a stool on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=124.56s)]
*  stage and being like, I'm an idiot. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=128.6s)]
*  Dude, I mean, that is possible. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=131.16s)]
*  But I'm going for it as even as you say it, I'm like, would be really funny, though. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=132.88000000000002s)]
*  Like, I mean, you don't even got to worry about jokes for like the first five minutes of your [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  set. Like you could you'll you'll find enough. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  There's a well right there that you'll be able to dig into. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=145.8s)]
*  But yes, we will be out in Boozman, Montana, just coming up now in a little over a week. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=149.12s)]
*  So go grab some tickets. Still a few seats available. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=155.68s)]
*  Comic Dave Smith dot com. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=158.64s)]
*  And then, of course, the following week, we will be out in what do we got? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  We got Louisville, Kentucky, one night only January 30th and then January 30th and 31st [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=165.92s)]
*  will be in Fort Wayne, Indiana. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  And then I'm sorry, January. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=174.64s)]
*  My mistake, January, January 30th, we're in Louisville, January 31st and February 1st [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  were in Fort Wayne, Indiana. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=185.92s)]
*  The following week after that, Key West, Florida, then Buffalo, Boston, Chicago, Rosemont, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=187.76s)]
*  Appleton, Wisconsin, Denver, Cleveland, Tacoma, Spokane, Tampa and still a few more dates [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=194.64s)]
*  on there that have not been added yet. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  So we are going to be busy this year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm just smiling because like it's like you just scheduled drinking for me. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=206.56s)]
*  Like those are those are dangerous three weekends in a row. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=212.12s)]
*  I've been looking forward to traveling to Louisville. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=215.4s)]
*  Key West, it's it's remarkable how much drinking goes on down there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  And then Buffalo. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  I've never seen anything in my life that one time I went into a bar in Buffalo and it was freezing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=223.4s)]
*  And I ordered a maker's mark on the rocks and got a milkshake glass. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=228.56s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't even I guess I'm having one. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't even understand the the economics on this, on how that was only eight dollars. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=237.36s)]
*  But sure, I'll drink a bottle out of this glass. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=241.52s)]
*  They are. Yeah, I have scheduled some drink. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=244.68s)]
*  I should also put on my website like when Rob needs to go get blood work done, when he needs to take liver enzyme medication. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=246.44s)]
*  It's we'll schedule it all at. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=252.72s)]
*  Don't you guys worry? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  But I am looking forward to a lot of these shows. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=255.44s)]
*  Anyway, Comic Dave Smith dot com for all those ticket lengths. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=257.68s)]
*  All right. So. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=260.36s)]
*  To start today's show, I just listen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=263.52s)]
*  I can't not. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  That's my only that's my only disclaimer. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=268.44s)]
*  I'm just I get at this point now in this weird world that we live in, in this weird career that I've carved out for myself. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=271.72s)]
*  I get flooded on social media whenever Chris Cuomo says something dumb. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=280.04s)]
*  That's my cross to to bear. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=285.72s)]
*  I don't know. But they are always and everybody is just, you know, like, Dave, you got to knock this one out of the park again. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  And so I don't know, particularly in this clip where I do feel maybe this is just my own narcissism, but I do feel like I'm a little bit a part of these rounds. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=296.68s)]
*  Like, it's always kind of directed at me. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=305.04s)]
*  I mean, the last time he actually called me out by name this time, he doesn't mention me. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  But as I've made clear. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=310.68s)]
*  Like it was about you. I don't think that was narcissism. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=312.72s)]
*  If it feels like he's talking about you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=314.92s)]
*  I mean, the real issue is that Cuomo just can't get over it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=317.68s)]
*  He's just can't get over the fact that in his mind, and I get it, you know, like he's a Cuomo. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=323.20000000000005s)]
*  He was the mayor's kid and then I'm sorry, the governor's kid. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=328.0s)]
*  And then his brother became governor, too, and he's the number one show on CNN. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  And then he comes into this debate with some podcaster comedian and just gets walloped. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=335.72s)]
*  And that's I understand that can be tough, but that's not really my fault. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=341.24s)]
*  And as I've said before, I reserve the right to just destroy you anytime I want to. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  So that's where we are. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=354.2s)]
*  And then I fucking chief nerd is like one of my favorite accounts on Twitter. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  And then he always posts these videos. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=361.23999999999995s)]
*  And so I always see him because I'm always interact. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=362.96s)]
*  He's like in my algorithm or whatever. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=365.28s)]
*  And then even if he wasn't, I mean, Jesus, man, the amount of people who just sent this to me was pretty nuts. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=367.76s)]
*  Anyway, no further ado. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=373.76s)]
*  Let's let's go to our guy, Chris Cuomo and his latest. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=375.96s)]
*  So, no, I'm not I'm not going to be able to cover the world the way CNN can. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  But whatever I'm covering, my reporting, what I know, my sources, I'm OK. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=388.96s)]
*  A lot more than these guys on digital media. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, are you kidding me? They're not reporters. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=396.28s)]
*  They don't have sources. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  That's why they go with some sources and they take it from other places. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=399.28s)]
*  And then they package it in an opinion, which is fine. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=402.88s)]
*  But the idea that they are at an advantage against the Wall Street Journal [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=406.11999999999995s)]
*  because they cherry pick every time somebody gets something wrong. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=410.52s)]
*  Like, you know how easy that is to do? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=414.76s)]
*  How often do they get things wrong? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=417.11999999999995s)]
*  However, they have truth. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=419.2s)]
*  They want you to believe that the vaccine that Donald Trump got us [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  faster than we could have ever gotten it otherwise, he says, and everybody seems to agree. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  The man they voted for and supported for president wound up producing something that's poison. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=429.52s)]
*  All right. So just pause the covid vaccine. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=435.28s)]
*  Just how sad is all of this? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=438.2s)]
*  I mean, what can I even say here, Rob? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=440.88s)]
*  It's just I mean, just pathetic. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=442.52s)]
*  It's the same old thing, the same Sam Harris thing where you're [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  you're just counting on like the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=449.32s)]
*  the esteem of the Wall Street Journal. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  And how can you how you know? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=457.76s)]
*  And like, look again. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=459.32s)]
*  Sure, fine. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=461.88s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal has a budget and they have journalists [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=464.08s)]
*  and they have sources and they have, you know, got. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=467.28s)]
*  But what does all that result in? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=469.68s)]
*  It ends up resulting in just being what? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=471.8s)]
*  The CIA's mouthpiece or something like that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=475.4s)]
*  So, OK, yes, there's there's these people online who just have opinions, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=478.72s)]
*  who just point out when someone's getting something wrong. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=483.76s)]
*  And that's easy to do. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=486.04s)]
*  Um, all right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=488.44s)]
*  Fine. It does come fairly easily to me. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=490.8s)]
*  I agree. It's what an advantage. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=494.72s)]
*  All I have to do is point out what you guys are wrong about, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=497.92s)]
*  which, by the way, was everything, everything. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=500.28s)]
*  And then, you know, again, I understand he's not like saying me by name, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=503.6s)]
*  but I don't know exactly who the fuck he's talking about here. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=507.12s)]
*  And it's like and then he goes, oh, well, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=510.04s)]
*  you know, I actually for a second, they are kind of like got my eyebrows up. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=513.72s)]
*  Like when he goes out the first time, I heard this not just now. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=516.76s)]
*  But when I heard this, he goes like, well, anyone could do that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=519.6s)]
*  I mean, I could point out what you're wrong about. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=521.68s)]
*  And I'm kind of like, OK, yeah, that's right. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=523.56s)]
*  That's how these things work. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=526.16s)]
*  I can point out what you're wrong about and you can point out what I'm wrong about. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=527.88s)]
*  So what do you got on me? What? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=530.64s)]
*  That the vaccine is poison, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=533.88s)]
*  that Trump, the guy you voted for is the one who did that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  But I mean, like if he's not talking about me, who's he talking about? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=539.88s)]
*  Like any of the Rogan? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=542.4799999999999s)]
*  First off, none of us supported Donald Trump the first time. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=544.16s)]
*  So that doesn't really work. Right. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=547.16s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=549.8s)]
*  none of us said the vaccine was poison. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. That's not what we said. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=554.4s)]
*  Why don't it's like if you want to point out the things that were if it's so easy [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=556.68s)]
*  to point out the things we're wrong about, then why do you have to lie? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=561.28s)]
*  Why can't you just take on something we actually said? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=565.28s)]
*  I don't know. It's become a theme in my career, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=567.88s)]
*  which is that like everybody who's so outraged about me always has to totally [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=571.2399999999999s)]
*  straw man what it is I'm saying. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=575.12s)]
*  Again, I understand this one isn't specifically about me. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=577.04s)]
*  But if it's so easy to do so, then tell me what did I get wrong? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=579.7199999999999s)]
*  Like, but make it something I actually said. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=583.16s)]
*  And like, yeah, Donald Trump, what even is the claim here? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=585.56s)]
*  Donald Trump got the vaccine faster than it could have been done [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=589.12s)]
*  without Operation Warp Speed. OK. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=593.8s)]
*  I guess I'll concede that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=597.16s)]
*  Sure. It probably happened faster because of that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=598.64s)]
*  The claim isn't that the vaccine is poison. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=600.68s)]
*  OK, now [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=603.16s)]
*  it might be for some people like is is the is it true that people [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=605.3199999999999s)]
*  get vaccine injured by this vaccine? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  Yes, undeniably. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=611.92s)]
*  Nobody denies that anymore. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=613.4399999999999s)]
*  Not even Chris Cuomo. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=615.28s)]
*  OK, now Chris Cuomo certainly would have denied that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=616.5999999999999s)]
*  when we were saying it was true and he was saying it's not like when he was at CNN. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=620.52s)]
*  He certainly would have denied that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=625.68s)]
*  But no, the claim and look. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  Let's let's just make them real simple here. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=631.24s)]
*  The claim is that number one, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=633.64s)]
*  the vaccines did not work at all as they were sold. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=637.92s)]
*  That they were sold on lies to. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=642.24s)]
*  It's not that they got it wrong. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=646.24s)]
*  It's that they lied about it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=648.68s)]
*  OK, so like in other words, when Fauci was out there and by the way, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=650.76s)]
*  the the new director of the National Institute of Health, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=655.04s)]
*  assuming he gets through, Jay Bhattacharya was one of the best guys [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=658.12s)]
*  on pointing this out. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=662.28s)]
*  It's not like when Fauci was saying. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=663.4s)]
*  If you take this vaccine, you can't get covid [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  and you can't transmit it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=670.92s)]
*  He was totally like. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  Just being inexcusably reckless when he said, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=676.12s)]
*  I don't know if Jay Bhattacharya would actually call Fauci a liar, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  like I'll call him that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=682.24s)]
*  I don't know if he'd use that word. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=683.24s)]
*  He would say something more professional sounding like a real [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=684.76s)]
*  Prince for smart genius guy that I'm not. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  But he would have said something like, you know, the data does not back up [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=690.7199999999999s)]
*  this claim at all. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=694.52s)]
*  OK, but like I'll take that and say, yeah, he's lying. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=696.4399999999999s)]
*  He had no there was no scientific evidence that this was true. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=700.1600000000001s)]
*  And yet he told people that this was repeated by people like Chris Cuomo [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=703.4s)]
*  and Rachel Maddow and this guy. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=707.36s)]
*  Have you heard of Joe Biden? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=709.72s)]
*  He was the president of the United States. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=711.76s)]
*  He also said the same thing. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=713.36s)]
*  It was repeated by everyone that if you get the vaccine is safe and effective [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=714.72s)]
*  and if you get it, you can't get covid and you can't transmit covid. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=718.24s)]
*  That's what was told to anyone. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=721.84s)]
*  And then a bunch of people took it who never should have. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=723.0s)]
*  OK, and that's claim number three, that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=726.76s)]
*  a huge portion of the people who took the vaccine never should have, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=729.84s)]
*  that they were taking a risk for absolutely no reward. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=734.4s)]
*  And that the truth is that people who were not immunocompromised, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=737.6800000000001s)]
*  who were not old and sick, particularly here's the one group that I just never get. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=741.48s)]
*  There's no scientific response from this young, healthy people [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=748.6s)]
*  who had already had covid. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  Were in many cases forced to get the vaccine [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=755.8399999999999s)]
*  and then forced to get boosters on top of it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=759.7199999999999s)]
*  That is that is totally based on pseudoscience. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  There is absolutely no justification for that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, if it's so easy to point out what's wrong, Chris Cuomo, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=767.76s)]
*  here's the challenge. All right. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  I know you're never going to debate me again, but here's the challenge. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=774.0s)]
*  Point out what's wrong in any of that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=778.16s)]
*  Tell me what I'm getting wrong. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=781.3199999999999s)]
*  Take on something I'm actually saying and tell me what's wrong about that, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=782.92s)]
*  because it's so easy to just sit back and point out what other people get wrong. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  OK. Let's hear it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  Any thoughts, Rob? Yeah, you know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=791.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't remember all the ins and outs of covid anymore. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=795.04s)]
*  I certainly had it all in my brain at the time. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  I remember my grandfather used to read a lot about the Civil War. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  At some point, he stopped reading about it and he's like, I don't remember any of that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=802.7199999999999s)]
*  Like, I used to be able to tell you every detail of like the wars and this and that. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=805.5999999999999s)]
*  But if I had to give a shorter [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=809.52s)]
*  just theme to what we were talking about is, hey, they're lying to you [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=812.0s)]
*  and they shouldn't be taking away our freedoms. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=815.48s)]
*  And so I think he's kind of misrepresenting it as that with the poison claim. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=818.12s)]
*  I mean, I think I said that there might be risks [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=823.96s)]
*  and that there's really no upside here. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=826.76s)]
*  So I don't know why you would take it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=828.4s)]
*  But I don't think we ever went to personally, I don't think we went too extreme on. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=829.52s)]
*  I mean, I made jokes that Dick was going to fall off. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the free and that's where that's be right. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=836.68s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I want to have it removed anyway. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=840.28s)]
*  So for me personally, it's convenient. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=842.52s)]
*  But anyways, I think we were always a little bit more concerned with the freedom part. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=845.88s)]
*  And, you know, three years later, it's very easy to try and re [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=850.92s)]
*  litigate these things and then now get a detail wrong. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=854.8399999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't matter because we were 100 percent right at the time [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=857.8s)]
*  when it was actually important. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=861.68s)]
*  Just one more thing, and this is technical. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=864.04s)]
*  I agree with everything you said there, but I do read the Wall Street Journal [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=866.4s)]
*  on a nearly basic, nearly daily basis. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=869.92s)]
*  I've been reading it for over a decade. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=872.12s)]
*  I don't like I think there's a lot of terrible media out there. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=874.5999999999999s)]
*  And in the opinion sections, I certainly think that they overpitch wars [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  and maybe through the covid era, they were guilty of omission [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=881.8s)]
*  and that other people did much better coverage about how the regime was getting [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=884.88s)]
*  things getting things wrong. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=888.52s)]
*  I don't know that I would slap the CIA title on the Wall Street Journal [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  the same I would CNN or the like maybe the Washington Post deserves it [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=893.48s)]
*  more than than the Wall Street Journal. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  I'll say this. The Wall Street Journal is the most interesting of the newspapers [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=899.0s)]
*  to read because the Wall Street Journal is what they're saying to people [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=903.72s)]
*  who make 400 K a year. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=908.32s)]
*  It's not exactly the same. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=910.6s)]
*  They're not talking and just like their lowest level of tax cattle. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=912.28s)]
*  Like they're talking to kind of like the upper middle class tax cattle. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=916.52s)]
*  And so you just get more of you just get more. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=920.68s)]
*  And by the way, I'm also not trying to act like there's good stuff. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=924.76s)]
*  There's been good reporting in the New York Times and in the Washington Post, too. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=928.16s)]
*  They often try to pretend like they never reported that [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=931.8s)]
*  when the narrative changes later. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  But I do agree with you. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=936.76s)]
*  There is some value in the in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=938.2399999999999s)]
*  So I'm not sorry. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=940.28s)]
*  I'm not trying to offend your sensibilities. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=941.4s)]
*  I see where your loyalty is, Rob. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=944.2399999999999s)]

*  Proton VPN dot com slash Dave Smith. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1015.76s)]
*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1019.72s)]
*  But anyway, I just think that this again, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1022.52s)]
*  as always with this whole, you know, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1027.8s)]
*  it's very similar to the Sam Harris critique. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1032.16s)]
*  It's I get saying, oh, come on, the Internet just has these random guys. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1035.88s)]
*  But this isn't a replacement for The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  Henry Kissinger or whatever. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1045.52s)]
*  Again, if you're going to make that argument, fine. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1047.0s)]
*  I think it's a valid argument. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1050.64s)]
*  But you also have to deal with the fact that all of these institutions have completely failed. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1052.5600000000002s)]
*  And even to your point on The Wall Street Journal, it's like, yeah, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1057.88s)]
*  but like when when it really mattered the most, it's not like you're like you said, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1061.08s)]
*  a lot of the really important shit's going to be omitted from those pages. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1067.24s)]
*  I like to state it differently. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1070.4399999999998s)]
*  I agree with him. It'd be nice. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1071.84s)]
*  It would be much nicer to live in a world where the people that have all the resources [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1074.04s)]
*  to do journalism and get these stories right. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1077.8799999999999s)]
*  Got it right. I would prefer to live in that world. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1080.6399999999999s)]
*  By the way, I like writing jokes. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1083.1999999999998s)]
*  It's a lot easier to just read the actual information and then write jokes about it [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1084.4399999999998s)]
*  than to have to sit through it and go, hey, I don't think you're giving me the real information. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1088.72s)]
*  And to go one step further, if we lived in an honest world, in an honest environment, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1092.56s)]
*  people like us that have been on, I wouldn't call it the sidelines because we're on the forefront [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1096.88s)]
*  of kind of the Internet, news, media, political commentary game. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1101.0s)]
*  But like in a different environment, I think people that like to make money [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1105.4s)]
*  might step in and go, wow, these guys are actually really good at this. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1109.16s)]
*  Why aren't we giving them a producer? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1111.92s)]
*  And, you know, what does Sean Hannity make of your 30 million dollars or whatever? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1113.6s)]
*  I think that's how many producers I'll do it for half. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1117.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do it for half that. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  So I'm just saying to further combat what he's saying. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1124.0s)]
*  I wish that the news organizations that had all the resources [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1127.6s)]
*  didn't use all the resources to lied us and sell government agendas, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  because that's typically what I'm watching them doing. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1134.28s)]
*  And on the same note, if you gave us all those resources. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1136.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know how much better at this we could be. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1139.48s)]
*  I'd love that. I would love to be a full time drunk [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1141.68s)]
*  and just get talking points from someone that does my job [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1144.12s)]
*  and just puts it together. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1147.1999999999998s)]
*  It will. Well, this is what's so interesting about this. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1149.1599999999999s)]
*  And this is part of the reason why I've, you know, I've talked about this [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1152.08s)]
*  several times on the show. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1156.28s)]
*  I mean, number one, it's just it's it's kind of it's interesting to me [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1160.12s)]
*  and it's a little bit surreal. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1164.4399999999998s)]
*  It's weird to debate the guy who was the number one show at CNN. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1165.9599999999998s)]
*  It's weird to be called out by Sam Harris by name, you know. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1169.3999999999999s)]
*  And then OK, so there's a little like my own like ego in this. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1172.6s)]
*  I'll fully admit that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1176.6s)]
*  But there's it's like when they make this point, you're like, listen, dude, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1178.0s)]
*  no one agrees with you more than me. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  Do you know? Do you know how disconcerting it is? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1185.7199999999998s)]
*  Like, do you do if I may [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1189.32s)]
*  the fucking head comedian from the Legion of Skanks [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1193.7199999999998s)]
*  who has a fucking portion of my garage [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1198.6s)]
*  turned into a podcast studio, if I was going to debate [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1202.76s)]
*  the number one show host at CNN. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1208.48s)]
*  I should find myself against somebody formidable [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1213.16s)]
*  and I should be like, whoa, this guy knows way more than I know about this stuff. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1218.32s)]
*  This guy's read every book I've read and then he's read five books [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1222.52s)]
*  slapping down the stuff of the books that I've read. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1226.08s)]
*  And this guy is just like a wealth of knowledge and information and wisdom. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1228.52s)]
*  And I just can't even compete with it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1233.32s)]
*  But that's not what I find when I go to debate [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1235.36s)]
*  the number one show host on CNN. Right. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1238.48s)]
*  So like, I'm sorry, you can't turn around and blame me for that. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1242.68s)]
*  The point is that the institutions have failed. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1246.2s)]
*  They got it all wrong. And no, I'm sorry, Chris Cuomo. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1248.3999999999999s)]
*  It would not like if you want to try to do again, I mean, I don't know. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1252.1599999999999s)]
*  You know, like when we debated, he had prepared to some degree, you know, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1257.48s)]
*  he mentioned Legion of Skanks and he mentioned a few things about me. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1260.24s)]
*  So he had watched a few hours of, you know, or I don't know how much, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1263.68s)]
*  but he had watched some of my content. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1267.04s)]
*  But like. If Chris Cuomo wants to sit down [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1270.36s)]
*  and watch the last three years or four years of part of the problem, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1274.52s)]
*  for him to sit there and say, like, oh, it would be just as easy for me [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1279.48s)]
*  to sit back and point out everything you've gotten wrong. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1282.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1285.44s)]
*  Like, I will gladly, as I said to his face in the debate, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1286.92s)]
*  I will gladly put my track record up against yours [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1290.6000000000001s)]
*  and we can see who got what wrong and who got what right. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1294.2s)]
*  And how important the things we got wrong were. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1296.96s)]
*  And if we got something wrong, how quickly we adjust it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1299.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? And like took in the new information. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1302.64s)]
*  That's I'm happy to do that. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1305.52s)]
*  All right. Let's let's keep playing. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1308.48s)]
*  The covid vaccine kills the covid [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  covid vaccine kills more people than it helped in any way. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1314.28s)]
*  That's what they want you to believe. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1317.2s)]
*  And you should have never been forced to pause it right there. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1319.2s)]
*  Pause it right there. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1321.8s)]
*  Again, just and just bring it back a few seconds [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1323.4s)]
*  because he's going to get into this forced to take it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1326.8s)]
*  But again, it's just and this would be my only fault. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1329.16s)]
*  This is why it's so easy to debate a guy like Chris Cuomo, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1333.2s)]
*  because like if we were in a debate and he says something like that, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1336.04s)]
*  you're the follow up question is just OK, who said that? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1339.36s)]
*  Go ahead, Cuomo, who who said that? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1346.84s)]
*  Who said that the whole thing is that the vaccine has killed more people [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1349.28s)]
*  than it helped? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1353.1599999999999s)]
*  By the way, that's like, first of all, I don't know how you would even measure that. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1354.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't know how we would even know, you know, like that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1358.32s)]
*  How do you measure the people that the vaccine helped? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1361.52s)]
*  I mean, it's like the standard during the height of the craziness, Rob, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1364.4799999999998s)]
*  was just assuming that it would have been worse [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1368.56s)]
*  if you hadn't gotten the vaccine, right? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1371.4399999999998s)]
*  So like if you get the vaccine, you remember this during Covid, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1373.6s)]
*  like if you get the vaccine and then you get Covid and you get very, very sick. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1375.8s)]
*  Well, that's proof you would have died [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1378.76s)]
*  if you didn't have the vaccine or something like that. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1381.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody is necessarily claiming that it hurt more people [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1383.56s)]
*  than it helped or killed more people than it helped. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1387.1599999999999s)]
*  As I've said, I do think that there was an argument [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1390.28s)]
*  that people who were very vulnerable at the very beginning [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1396.44s)]
*  when there were still very deadly strands of Covid out there [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1400.96s)]
*  might have been better off taking this vaccine. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1404.68s)]
*  Like, I don't really know. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1407.28s)]
*  I don't I'm not like claiming to have not. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1408.76s)]
*  What I'm saying is that there were people who didn't fall into the risk category at all. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1410.48s)]
*  Like, I use the example a bunch of times, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1415.6s)]
*  but it's just because I happen to know the kid. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1418.2s)]
*  There was literally a guy he was 25 or something like that. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1420.16s)]
*  And he was at an Ivy League grad school. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1424.16s)]
*  And he literally they made him get the the two doses of the vaccine, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1428.0800000000002s)]
*  like get the vaccine at first and then like whatever it was. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1433.48s)]
*  Months later, he got Covid. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1437.68s)]
*  And then the next month, the school decided that the policy was to get a booster. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1440.04s)]
*  So they made him a month after [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1445.44s)]
*  get having Covid, get a booster for Covid when he's a young, healthy guy, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1448.2s)]
*  had already had Covid, had already had two shots. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1453.24s)]
*  I'm saying that makes no sense. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  And there's lots of people who are forced into this category to get it. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1459.2s)]
*  And some number of those people did get vaccine injured. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1462.3200000000002s)]
*  And 100 percent of the people who got vaccine injured didn't need to be. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  They they were just in a group where Covid was never a threat to them. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1472.64s)]
*  It was statistically non-existent, the threat of Covid. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1476.2800000000002s)]
*  So, like, that's the point. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1480.0s)]
*  And nobody seems to want to take on that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1482.48s)]
*  And at the time, at the time that this was happening, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  basically, everyone was like, you're a bad person if you even bring that up, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1491.16s)]
*  if you even bring up that this vaccine is being pushed on people [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1495.2800000000002s)]
*  who who should not take it. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1498.92s)]
*  All right. Let's keep lying. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1501.76s)]
*  I also. Sorry, go ahead, Rob. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1503.24s)]
*  It's the wrong place to litigate this, which is around government. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1505.68s)]
*  There were unintended consequences of government shutting down the country [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  and going full Covid nonsense. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1515.72s)]
*  And that's what we were against. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1518.5600000000002s)]
*  We were against government removing freedoms, telling you [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1520.0400000000002s)]
*  that you couldn't pursue your job, telling you that you couldn't go exercise. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1522.1200000000001s)]
*  You look at missed education, you look at missed cancer diagnosis. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1525.68s)]
*  Like you look at the fact that people stop living life for a year or two years [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1529.64s)]
*  or people are still trying to put their careers together. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1534.16s)]
*  They lost their restaurants. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1536.3600000000001s)]
*  They lost their businesses. They built their whole lives over. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1537.8000000000002s)]
*  There are secondary conversations to be had about the dangers of the actual vaccine, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1541.48s)]
*  of which the data well, I think, has been too muddy to really prove. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1545.96s)]
*  Yeah. As to, you know, I think. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1549.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think the government purposely manipulated the data with things such as [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1551.8000000000002s)]
*  not considering you vaccinated until two weeks after you got it. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1555.44s)]
*  And all sorts of other screen and anyone with an unknown vaccine [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1558.88s)]
*  vaccine status is considered to be unvaccinated. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1562.44s)]
*  They pulled all sorts of shenanigans throughout the entire thing. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1565.3600000000001s)]
*  You're never going to have a good data set. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1567.8000000000002s)]
*  But that was never the core part of the conversation that we were having, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1569.16s)]
*  which was, hey, they're lying to you and we shouldn't be shutting down [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1573.64s)]
*  the country over this. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1577.3200000000002s)]
*  And what data do you have to suggest that we should? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1578.2800000000002s)]
*  And why are they enforcing removing your medical freedoms [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1580.6000000000001s)]
*  over this vaccine that hasn't been properly studied? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1584.68s)]
*  So I think he's just having kind of a different conversation. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1587.56s)]
*  And you could have that argument, but like you're already jumping nine, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1591.1999999999998s)]
*  nine levels past kind of the terrible decisions that government made [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1594.9199999999998s)]
*  that we talked out against and Cuomo sold on his TV show. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1599.0s)]
*  Yeah. All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1603.32s)]
*  which is Fume. Fume has been with us for a long time. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1606.3999999999999s)]
*  And I really love Fume. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  Fume is a flavored air device that helps you give up your bad habits. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1611.08s)]
*  I know there's a lot of people who have a lot of bad habits out there [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  and a lot of us are trying to quit, myself included. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1618.8400000000001s)]
*  Fume is great for this. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1621.6000000000001s)]
*  It draws flavor to your mouth. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1622.8s)]
*  It gives you something to fidget with. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1624.16s)]
*  It gives you something to pull on. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1625.6000000000001s)]
*  And this is very helpful when breaking bad habits, as we all know. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1627.04s)]
*  It's a totally healthy alternative. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1630.8400000000001s)]

*  And like I said, it's made to fidget with. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1639.96s)]
*  It's very good for calming anxiety when you're trying to give up bad habits. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1641.8s)]

*  Perfectly said, 100 percent. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1672.64s)]
*  All right, let's let's let's play the rest. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1674.64s)]
*  I believe and you should have never been forced to take it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1678.16s)]
*  Now, by the way, I don't believe you were forced to take it. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1682.48s)]
*  There was freedom of choice. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1685.72s)]
*  There wasn't freedom from consequence for those choices. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1686.92s)]
*  You got the government, Donald Trump, saying [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1690.8s)]
*  this is what we need to do to do it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1694.8s)]
*  And then you think you're going to get the same access everywhere [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1697.48s)]
*  if you don't do those things. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1699.44s)]
*  And you don't think that the numbers show that when the vaccine came out [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1700.64s)]
*  and made it into the vulnerable communities, we didn't see a precipitous [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1705.56s)]
*  drop in the cases and in serious illness. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1708.3200000000002s)]
*  It's not even a close call. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1712.3600000000001s)]
*  OK, so I'm not going to be those are the bombshells right there of stupidity. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1714.76s)]
*  Yes, this is that right. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1718.8s)]
*  So these are the bombshells of stupidity. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1720.6000000000001s)]
*  So like, let's really take this apart a little bit. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1722.16s)]
*  First of all, this just tired, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1725.88s)]
*  brain dead argument that like, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1728.96s)]
*  oh, you weren't forced freedom of choice doesn't mean freedom from consequences. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1733.56s)]
*  OK, so I guess if I put a gun to your head and say, give me your wallet [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1739.76s)]
*  or I'll blow your brains out, that's not me forcing you to give me the money. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1743.52s)]
*  Right. No, you have a choice. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1748.24s)]
*  See, you have a choice. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1750.76s)]
*  You can give me your wallet or you can have your brains blown out. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1751.64s)]
*  It doesn't mean freedom from consequences, Rob. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1754.0s)]
*  The consequences are from you. That's mob shit. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1756.8799999999999s)]
*  Hey, this or I'm going to do the following to you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1759.6s)]
*  So that's not a choice. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1762.04s)]
*  That's you are going to do those consequences. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1763.3999999999999s)]
*  That's not like I can't even think of it. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1765.6s)]
*  It's not even Rob. It's not even mob shit. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1767.9599999999998s)]
*  It's mob shit from the very dim brother of the dawn [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1770.84s)]
*  or the son of the previous godfather. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1775.36s)]
*  It's fratome mob shit. OK, this is like, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1778.9199999999998s)]
*  who are you expecting to actually believe you? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1782.0s)]
*  You're saying like when you say, oh, you're not going to be able to go everywhere. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1784.6000000000001s)]
*  He's talking about the the vaccine passports. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1788.08s)]
*  And these were not decisions, by the way. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1791.56s)]
*  It's like if you want to make some libertarian argument, as if, you know, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1793.32s)]
*  Chris Cuomo is going to pretend to be a libertarian all of a sudden. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1796.96s)]
*  But if you want to say that, like, OK, like if your employer would fire you, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1799.52s)]
*  you know, because there were like tons of, say, like privately enforced [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1805.96s)]
*  vaccine mandates. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1809.6s)]
*  So if you want to claim that, like your company [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1810.8s)]
*  deciding you had to take the vaccine isn't force. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1815.52s)]
*  OK, there's an argument there. You're still wrong. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1818.96s)]
*  We could get into that if you want to. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1821.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, that still is really force in the context of how much government [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1823.08s)]
*  intervention there was in this process to begin with. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1826.96s)]
*  But you're talking about like the the government of major cities [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1830.04s)]
*  across the country decided for a while we were straight up second class citizens [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  in New York City. You couldn't go to an event at Madison Square Garden. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1838.96s)]
*  You couldn't sit down at a restaurant. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1842.24s)]
*  You couldn't go to like movie theaters. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1843.88s)]
*  There were all types of things you weren't allowed to go to. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1846.2s)]
*  And that's the government coming in and telling those businesses. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1848.56s)]
*  Look, I remember I've told this story before. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1851.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to tell it again now. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1853.88s)]
*  But the story when me and my wife got turned away from that restaurant [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1855.16s)]
*  because we didn't I wasn't going to show the fake vaccine card. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1858.08s)]
*  I told you the guy who I was almost like getting in a fight [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1861.32s)]
*  with this Mexican guy at the spot. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1863.8s)]
*  He literally what snapped me out of it was he was like, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1865.92s)]
*  it's a thousand dollar fine for everyone. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1868.76s)]
*  I bring it like he was literally going, dude, of course, I want your business, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1871.0s)]
*  but I can't risk the fine that'll come with it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1874.44s)]
*  Like this was a little diner in Washington Heights. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1877.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? We were going to maybe spend 60 bucks there. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1880.08s)]
*  They can't risk a thousand dollar fine for like a sixty dollar, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1883.28s)]
*  you know, potential [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1887.08s)]
*  revenue. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1890.12s)]
*  That's force, dude. That's force. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1891.8s)]
*  They're force. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1894.9199999999998s)]
*  You were finding the businesses. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1896.1599999999999s)]
*  If they served vaccinated people, the businesses were being forced [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1898.24s)]
*  to tell people they weren't allowed to come in if they weren't vaccinated [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1902.96s)]
*  or didn't have the dumb card, which everyone could get a fake one anyway. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1906.88s)]
*  It was all stupid. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1910.4s)]
*  It was just a matter of like whether you wanted to play that game or not, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1911.3600000000001s)]
*  which I did not on principle, didn't want to play that game. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1914.68s)]
*  But [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1917.88s)]
*  look, I mean, the argument that it wasn't forced because you had choice, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1919.8400000000001s)]
*  but there were consequences. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1924.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, consequences imposed by the governments, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1925.44s)]
*  which you are forced to live under. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1928.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, there's no opt out process. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1931.2800000000002s)]
*  There's no if you're in New York City, you can't go. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1933.16s)]
*  I don't really like the government of New York City, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1935.2s)]
*  and I would like to live under a different government. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1937.2800000000002s)]
*  You don't have that option. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1939.3200000000002s)]
*  So, yes, it's force. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1940.64s)]
*  So there's I don't know anything else you want to jump in with, Rob, please go ahead. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1942.64s)]
*  And then I could get to the next part. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1945.8400000000001s)]
*  Let's get to the next part, because it's also gloriously stupid. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1947.88s)]
*  But I was just so irritated by that, that freedom, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1950.48s)]
*  the consequences from you, you're just describing force. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1954.5600000000002s)]
*  That's the way force works. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1958.4s)]
*  If I tell you, hey, if you don't do what I want you to do, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1959.72s)]
*  I'm going to come punch you in the face. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1962.76s)]
*  That's that isn't that that's the depth. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1964.3200000000002s)]
*  That's force. That's coercion. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1966.88s)]
*  Well, right. I mean, and you just it's not look, I suppose, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1969.3200000000002s)]
*  as is always the case with laws and and governments, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1972.64s)]
*  I suppose you could argue that there are it's a few levels [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1977.0400000000002s)]
*  removed from like the naked, blatant force. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1980.8400000000001s)]
*  But like so when, you know, when that, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1983.76s)]
*  you know, the store owner or the diner, the guy who works at the diner there [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1988.3200000000002s)]
*  is saying, hey, it's a thousand dollar fine. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1991.8000000000002s)]
*  OK, so if he gets that fine, you're going to be like, OK, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=1994.48s)]
*  well, he it's not force. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2001.24s)]
*  It's you know, it's just these are the consequences of the choice that you made. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2003.48s)]
*  Right. So the choice you made was to let somebody who doesn't have [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2006.92s)]
*  proof of vaccination eat at your restaurant. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2011.32s)]
*  And then the consequence is a thousand dollar fine. It was OK. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2013.12s)]
*  So let's say that that guy who who owns the diner says, no, I'm not paying that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2016.0s)]
*  What happens next? Cuomo. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2020.6399999999999s)]
*  Huh? What happens if he says I'm not paying you the thousand dollars? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2023.76s)]
*  I mean, take take me through this. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2027.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, OK, they'll probably be like a notice. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2029.32s)]
*  They'll probably be a follow up letter. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2032.96s)]
*  Maybe the fine will be increased. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2035.32s)]
*  Maybe there is. And then eventually they'll fucking come take it. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2037.28s)]
*  They'll come take it by force. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2040.3200000000002s)]
*  That's what's always there. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2041.92s)]
*  That with any law or any government policy, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2043.2800000000002s)]
*  the threat of force is always right behind it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2046.2800000000002s)]
*  It's always like, yeah, OK, if you don't do that, like with any ticket, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2049.04s)]
*  with any fine, it's like, yes, eventually they will come with naked force. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2052.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's only because there is that threat that anybody has to listen to it at all. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2057.92s)]
*  Right. So anyway, that's all. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2063.28s)]
*  OK. And then. All right. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2066.44s)]
*  So what was the other big one? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2067.6s)]
*  Now, I'm getting so hung up on this one. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2068.6s)]
*  I forgot for a second. I'm sorry. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2070.3199999999997s)]
*  What was it? The replay? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2072.04s)]
*  I also. Yeah. OK. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2073.44s)]
*  Here, play it. Just play the last few seconds of that. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2074.96s)]
*  That clip. It'll come right back to us as soon as we play it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2078.24s)]
*  But there was one more real dumb thing. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2081.24s)]
*  He went there was one more real Fredo moment at the end of that. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2084.7599999999998s)]
*  You see a precipitous drop in cases and in serious illness. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2088.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not even a close call. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2092.4s)]
*  Not even a close call, Dave. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2095.88s)]
*  Not even a close call. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2098.12s)]
*  I mean, you want to have great data set, put them up against Tom Woods on that one. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2099.4s)]
*  I mean, let's let's look if we could, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2104.08s)]
*  Natalie, see if you could pull up even just in the US, the covid [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2107.2799999999997s)]
*  death rate, but like if we could get it by year. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2113.16s)]
*  Is there a way to do it like the covid death rate from, say, 2020 [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2117.3199999999997s)]
*  through maybe 2023 or something like that? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2120.56s)]
*  Because. He's wrong. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2124.48s)]
*  This is just like an objective question, and he's straight up wrong about that. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2128.16s)]
*  And if you remember, Rob, they had to pivot to what the reason was for that, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2131.8399999999997s)]
*  which was too much like vaccine hesitancy or something like that. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2135.88s)]
*  But it is just not the case that as soon as you saw the vaccine rollouts, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2139.16s)]
*  you saw this huge drop in covid cases and covid deaths. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2142.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. Am I am I? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2146.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2148.48s)]
*  But even if you were to have had that, you wouldn't be able to prove that it wasn't [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2149.3199999999997s)]
*  post spike in the area. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2152.2s)]
*  So I think the better proof against this would be the Tom [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2154.0s)]
*  Woods thing of looking at the [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2156.92s)]
*  which you've spoken to, but looking at the charts and like the vaccinated. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2160.6s)]
*  What was what was that? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2163.88s)]
*  Well, Tom Woods. OK, so he had a whole thing which, by the way, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2166.28s)]
*  I really highly recommend Tom's book on this. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2168.76s)]
*  If you want to go through, it's like the best book that was written about covid, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2171.52s)]
*  at least so far, called Diary of a Psychosis. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2174.2000000000003s)]
*  And I if you just Google that and Tom Woods, you'll you'll find the book real quick. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2178.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it was like covid book dot com. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2183.2000000000003s)]
*  But so he would look at these areas and you look at the areas and you do [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2186.52s)]
*  not just about the vaccine, but just like about lockdown lockdown. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2191.16s)]
*  Right. Well, it was lockdowns, non lockdowns. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2193.84s)]
*  It was mask mandates first, not mandates, mask compliance first, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2196.32s)]
*  where they didn't have high mask compliance. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2201.04s)]
*  And there's no trend. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2203.0s)]
*  There is no trend like you cannot look. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2204.68s)]
*  You could not pick them out on a man. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2207.56s)]
*  In fact, he did the whole quiz thing where the joke of it was that no one can get it [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2209.44s)]
*  right because you simply the virus simply acted the way it was going to act. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2213.48s)]
*  None of these measures mitigated it. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2218.76s)]
*  Now, we don't have real good, honest data out of China where they had like some [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2220.84s)]
*  real hardcore authoritarian lockdowns. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2225.2400000000002s)]
*  And it is possible that the most authoritarian lockdowns, like the lockdowns [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2227.92s)]
*  where you let people starve to death in their house because you won't let them out [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2232.56s)]
*  to go to the supermarket, it is possible that that had a meaningful impact on covid. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2235.64s)]
*  But short of advocating that you want to do something like that, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2240.2s)]
*  doing these sloppy, dumb lockdowns, the way that we did it in the United States [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2243.24s)]
*  of America, where you just deem the majority of people nonessential, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2246.96s)]
*  but you're still allowed to go to the grocery store and you're still allowed [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2250.6s)]
*  to go to the liquor store and you still whatever it did, nothing. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2253.52s)]
*  There's no and of course, there was the [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2257.64s)]
*  who was the [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2262.7999999999997s)]
*  the Ivy League school that did the major study on this, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2264.72s)]
*  where they found that same thing about lockdowns that basically [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2268.2799999999997s)]
*  there was there was little, if any, difference between the areas that locked [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2271.88s)]
*  down and didn't, but there was enormous difference in the economic devastation, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2276.04s)]
*  in the devastation toward children's learning improvements and things like that. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2280.84s)]
*  And depression and suicide and stuff like that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2285.08s)]
*  So it was enormously costly with no discernible benefit at all. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2287.4s)]
*  And the exact same thing is true about the areas that had vaccine [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2295.56s)]
*  mandates or vaccine passports or anything like that. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2299.64s)]
*  There was absolutely no trend that enforcing this. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2302.56s)]
*  And yes, it was forced Cuomo. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2305.6s)]
*  There's absolutely no evidence that enforcing any of this stuff [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2307.7999999999997s)]
*  actually did anything to mitigate the virus. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2311.24s)]
*  To be clear, I'd still be against the stuff, even if it did. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2313.68s)]
*  I believe in liberty and I don't think you can ruin people's lives, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2318.6s)]
*  you know, in this way. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2323.08s)]
*  So even if there was just to be clear, even if there was like [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2325.2799999999997s)]
*  a substantial, say, decrease in the death rate or not the death rate, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2328.9599999999996s)]
*  but in the total deaths or a decrease in the transmission rate [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2333.7999999999997s)]
*  or something like that in lockdown areas, I'd still be against lockdowns [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2338.3599999999997s)]
*  because I don't think you have the right to rob people's lives from them. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  That being said, there just wasn't. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2348.24s)]
*  There just is no benefit. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2350.2799999999997s)]
*  And no, I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure about this, that I'm right, that it did not. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2351.6s)]
*  It's not true that there was a huge drop in [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2355.12s)]
*  covid cases and deaths as soon as the vaccines came out. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2358.8399999999997s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2362.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, I guess I pivoted what he what he said in my head [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2364.04s)]
*  to just the overall strategy with the lockdowns. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2366.96s)]
*  I don't remember the specifics on this. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2370.64s)]
*  However, I do remember when [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2372.68s)]
*  when kids started getting it and Fauci had to answer for that. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2376.2s)]
*  And then, you know, he started talking about the new variant. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2379.44s)]
*  But don't worry, it's not as deadly. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2382.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it was all it. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2384.88s)]
*  He's just look, he's just not right about this. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2386.6s)]
*  OK, so let's see here, because I just got this chart right here. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2389.0s)]
*  So we can always just do a follow up on this. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2392.44s)]
*  I'll send it over to Steven, my wonder boy, non-scientist, autist on [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2394.44s)]
*  autist of the run your mouth enterprises. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2401.6800000000003s)]
*  And he'll give us a quick answer. No problem. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2403.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, but look, even just looking at this, right? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2405.7200000000003s)]
*  So let's let's take a look at this. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2409.84s)]
*  This chart that I just sent over, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2412.32s)]
*  because I would say at the very least, it is very unclear. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2415.6000000000004s)]
*  So here, let's see here, Natalie, just if you could pull up. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2420.7200000000003s)]
*  And this is a Pew Research. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2424.08s)]
*  It says this is two years of coronavirus deaths in the United States. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2426.6400000000003s)]
*  Can you pull that up, Natalie? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2433.8s)]
*  Here, let's see, I just well, let me see the one that I just sent you. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2442.84s)]
*  Did that come through? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2446.6800000000003s)]
*  Should yeah. OK, so here's so if we could zoom in a little bit on that, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2453.7200000000003s)]
*  we could just make it a little bit bigger. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2457.92s)]
*  I mean, so here you have right. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2459.88s)]
*  So you could look there. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2463.08s)]
*  You have what you're going to have with COVID as you keep the chart up. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2464.1600000000003s)]
*  You're going to have these [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2468.44s)]
*  it typically had dips in the summer and spikes in the colder season, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2471.2400000000002s)]
*  which is pretty consistent with upper respiratory viruses. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2476.0s)]
*  OK, so you have the initial wave here, as you can see in March [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2479.6800000000003s)]
*  when it comes in, going into the summer. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2484.44s)]
*  That's a real bad wave in the black is is excess deaths. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2486.92s)]
*  And in the blue is reported COVID-19 deaths. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2493.36s)]
*  OK, so then you have another massive wave in the winter of of 2020. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2496.8799999999997s)]
*  OK, this is before. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2503.7599999999998s)]
*  So right there in the middle, that middle kind of big [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2504.72s)]
*  jump that you see over December. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2508.12s)]
*  This is before the vaccines are rolled out, right? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2509.8799999999997s)]
*  The vaccines are rolled out in in early 2021. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2512.12s)]
*  OK, so then you have the summer of 2021. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2515.52s)]
*  You have another dip. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2518.08s)]
*  You could argue the dips a little bit lower than the dip in the summer before. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2519.3199999999997s)]
*  Doesn't seem to be any drastic relation. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2522.92s)]
*  But as soon as it gets cold again, look at these peaks. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2525.0s)]
*  The peak is as high as it was in March of 2020. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2527.92s)]
*  And then actually here at the end in the end of in December of 2021, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2532.7200000000003s)]
*  it seems like the numbers are higher than they were originally in 2020. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2538.2s)]
*  So, like, look, there's obviously with all of these things [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2542.92s)]
*  and this is what you were talking about with your your COVID expert buddy. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2545.96s)]
*  There's a lot of different ways to interpret data like this. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2550.08s)]
*  And you know what I'm saying? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2552.44s)]
*  Like there's different arguments that can be made. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2553.56s)]
*  But no, it is absolutely just not the case that there's this obvious drop [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2555.52s)]
*  once the vaccine comes out. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2560.48s)]
*  Like, look, if you're if you're talking about finding a cure for a disease. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2562.08s)]
*  Right. And a cure for a disease that was. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2567.24s)]
*  I mean, I remember, you know, again, we'd have to go back [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2571.16s)]
*  and look at all the numbers of this, but very pretty early on. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2573.44s)]
*  Like by the time. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2577.24s)]
*  So if we go back, I'm sorry, if we pull that chart up again, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2578.92s)]
*  by the time if you're looking at the last jump there, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2582.08s)]
*  the jump that's at the end of 2021, this is after already [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2585.1600000000003s)]
*  70 something percent of the adult population has been vaccinated. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2591.1600000000003s)]
*  So if you're talking about you have a cure for a disease [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2595.76s)]
*  and then you're going to argue like, look, this was obviously the cure. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2598.56s)]
*  And look at the drop after the cure was introduced. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2601.12s)]
*  Well, no, I'm sorry, like, that's not the case. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2606.2000000000003s)]
*  You could come up with some alternate explanation, perhaps, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2608.7599999999998s)]
*  for why this was the case. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2611.48s)]
*  This was all the fault of the unvaccinated or something like that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2612.72s)]
*  But you went from in 2020, you had 100 percent of people not being vaccinated. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2615.48s)]
*  And by the end of 2021, you had like 20 percent of people [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2620.2s)]
*  not being vaccinated at most. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2623.7999999999997s)]
*  So, no, if you're bragging that this was just so obvious, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2625.68s)]
*  you would expect to see a drop like a real, you know what I mean? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2629.64s)]
*  Like this thing is going down. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2633.04s)]
*  That's not what you're seeing there at all. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2634.8799999999997s)]
*  All right, guys, let's take a moment and thank our sponsor for today's show, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2637.72s)]

*  And I just I like to be comfortable. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2687.72s)]
*  And if I was, luckily for me, I'm not in an office environment. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2690.68s)]
*  But if I was, this is the type of thing I'd be looking for. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2693.7999999999997s)]

*  Let's get back into the show. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2723.44s)]
*  Cuomo is just making a case now of Cuomo actually what first up, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2726.1600000000003s)]
*  he's not capable of actually getting into like getting into the data and like [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2728.96s)]
*  really looking through it. But like, no, it's just it is not the case. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2732.6400000000003s)]
*  What he's saying is absolutely not true. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2736.32s)]
*  It's just another I know it's easy to sit here and point out things that people say [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2738.28s)]
*  that aren't true, that it's easier for some of us than others. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2742.04s)]
*  But no, it's just not the case at all that the vaccine came out and then they won. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2746.52s)]
*  And this is why I was remembering is because I'm remembering like, you know, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2750.36s)]
*  like I'm like you too, in the same way where like all this stuff was in my brain. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2753.7999999999997s)]
*  And now we're going back a few years and I've been thinking about other stuff [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2757.6s)]
*  since then and I don't have it as fresh. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2760.52s)]
*  But I do just remember like Israel was the example that we look to a bunch where [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2762.3599999999997s)]
*  they had because they were like way ahead of everybody else. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2767.7599999999998s)]
*  They were like they had like the highest [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2771.7599999999998s)]
*  vaccine rates and then they were already like on boosters for their seniors before [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2774.44s)]
*  anyone else. And it was after that that they had their they broke all their [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2779.3599999999997s)]
*  records for worst week in terms of transmission, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2783.08s)]
*  worst week in terms of deaths, all those things that came after. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2786.36s)]
*  So no, I'm sorry. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2789.48s)]
*  But again, it's kind of like I know this isn't like the deepest. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2791.48s)]
*  Like full proof explanation of all of this stuff, but much like with [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2798.56s)]
*  a lot of these psychotropic drugs, much like SSRIs and shit like that. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2804.0s)]
*  It's like if you if you're telling me this is the cure for depression [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2809.7599999999998s)]
*  and you came out with the cure and depression has risen since then. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2814.56s)]
*  I think it's reasonable for me to question whether that was really a cure or not. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2819.8799999999997s)]
*  And likewise, if you come out with a cure [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2824.7599999999998s)]
*  for covid and you force it on the on the public in large numbers and then after a [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2827.4s)]
*  year of this, we're having a wave where it's as bad as the year before the vaccine was out. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2833.52s)]
*  I think a reasonable starting point is to be skeptical of that cure, because [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2842.2s)]
*  typically speaking, when you have a disease and then you come up with a cure for the [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2848.0s)]
*  disease, what you see is deaths from that disease going way down. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2854.04s)]
*  So what Cuomo is doing here is he's trying [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2861.3199999999997s)]
*  to pretend that that's what happened in this example. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2864.2s)]
*  Like he's trying to pretend like we could all look at a chart as if you could look [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2867.88s)]
*  at a chart and just see like, OK, covid was it was all the way up here. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2871.2799999999997s)]
*  And then it just went down like after the vaccine came out, it just went down and down [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2874.96s)]
*  and down. If that were the case, there would be a much stronger argument here. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2879.04s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2882.7999999999997s)]
*  And you look at the data, that's not at all what happened. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2884.08s)]
*  And you could have some different [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2886.6s)]
*  interpretations for like, why is it that this spike was worse than that spike or [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2888.04s)]
*  whatever? And there's lots of different, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2892.88s)]
*  obviously, like natural immunity is a huge factor in all of this as well. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2896.6s)]
*  But it's just not the case that that exists when you actually look. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2900.44s)]
*  The data doesn't bear that out. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2903.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2905.64s)]
*  All right. Any other thoughts, Rob, before we switch over to the next topic real quick? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2907.2s)]
*  It seems to me like you have the data stuff right there, but I just want to go [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2912.2s)]
*  back to it doesn't matter. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2915.68s)]
*  Government did not have the data it needed to pretend like there was an [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2917.48s)]
*  emergency and strip us all of our freedoms. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2921.48s)]
*  And if anything, we learned the dangers of giving emergency powers to the [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2923.8399999999997s)]
*  government and their ability to abuse it. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2928.3599999999997s)]
*  And I think the burden of evidence was was on them. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2930.2s)]
*  And I don't think the vaccines were [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2933.3199999999997s)]
*  overwhelmingly good or tested to a T. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2935.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think the broader strategy of shutting down and removing people of their [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2938.7599999999998s)]
*  freedoms was a detriment to our society. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2943.16s)]
*  And Fauci is probably a liar and hopefully will be prosecuted. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2946.2799999999997s)]
*  Couldn't agree more, my friend, couldn't agree more. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2950.12s)]
*  All right. Let's just to end this on some on a light note. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2952.56s)]
*  Let's go check in with our friends over at Morning Joe. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2957.44s)]
*  I saw this one this morning. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2961.24s)]
*  Oh, my God, was this is just this is glorious. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2962.8399999999997s)]
*  Here is the daughter of the big new [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2965.72s)]
*  Brzezinski, Mika Brzezinski on Morning Joe. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2968.56s)]
*  No, I don't think she could have been right. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2973.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'm just going to wait for that conversation. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2977.08s)]
*  So you give your you give your theory that you know, I look, everyone knows how I feel. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2979.4s)]
*  I made it very clear after the debate that I thought it should continue. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2987.24s)]
*  But that was not what most people wanted. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2992.6s)]
*  So but Joe Biden is the kind of person who pulls himself up from rock bottom. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=2995.4s)]
*  And I think he could have stumbled into it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3001.56s)]
*  I really do. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3003.72s)]
*  People responded very badly when he beat Trump during that campaign [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3004.56s)]
*  to Trump, he's pulling him or going after his remaining son. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3010.08s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3015.2s)]
*  I know that she's going to say significantly dumber things, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3016.32s)]
*  but I have to call out the stumbled into it where the best hope that she has for [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3019.7599999999998s)]
*  him is that he could have Mr. Magood his way in. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3024.44s)]
*  That's her pitch. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3026.68s)]
*  I mean, she's she's going to say much dumber things. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3027.84s)]
*  But her pitch was not, hey, he could do the job. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3030.2s)]
*  It was he might have been able to stumble his way in. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3033.24s)]
*  And her pitch was it was, you know, you see a schizophrenic guy on the subway. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3036.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3040.6s)]
*  You see him again the next day. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3041.0s)]
*  He's still alive. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3042.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3043.52s)]
*  I know exactly how he did it. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3043.8799999999997s)]
*  But everything tends to work out. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3045.2s)]
*  It's Joe Biden. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3046.72s)]
*  He's going to walk around. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3047.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he'll fall a couple of times. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3048.2s)]
*  But at the end of it, he'll probably stumble his way in. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3049.7599999999998s)]
*  Literally, that's her argument. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3052.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean, literally just seeing how much this guy has fallen apart [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3055.3599999999997s)]
*  since then, since then, since the debate when he was unable to speak words [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3059.44s)]
*  into a microphone, seeing how much more he's fallen apart since then, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3065.36s)]
*  knowing that Donald Trump went on to win by such a wide margin, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3068.7200000000003s)]
*  knowing that the internal polling that the Biden White House had was even worse [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3073.44s)]
*  than what ended up happening. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3078.32s)]
*  They had Donald Trump getting 400 electoral votes. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3079.84s)]
*  And she's still going to hang on to this view that he would have won. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3083.84s)]
*  We are. Let's play the rest. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3088.48s)]
*  Let's hear your explanation for it. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3089.8s)]
*  Son, people stood up for Joe Biden because they knew who he was. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3093.52s)]
*  They know who he is. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3098.0400000000004s)]
*  And I think an aging Joe Biden is very self-aware about that. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3099.76s)]
*  And so is his team around him. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3104.44s)]
*  And he's still 10 times more qualified than what we've got. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3106.4s)]
*  And he's qualified to manage the world stage. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3112.28s)]
*  I think after that disastrous debate, he did a news conference. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3116.24s)]
*  Remind me, Lemire was at the NATO Summit a couple of weeks later. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3121.2s)]
*  A couple of weeks later. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3126.48s)]
*  At eight at night. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3127.68s)]
*  And, yep, he got names wrong. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3128.96s)]
*  Yes, he had to correct himself a few times. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3130.7599999999998s)]
*  But his knowledge of world affairs was in depth and clear and generated [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3133.04s)]
*  exactly what was the reality that this guy could manage. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3142.16s)]
*  The many different. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3146.0s)]
*  Isn't that the opposite of clear? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3147.72s)]
*  Isn't fumbling names literally the opposite of clear? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3149.72s)]
*  And when you say, well, the American people know who he is. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3153.28s)]
*  Yeah, an old guy with dementia that shouldn't be working the job. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3155.8s)]
*  That's what we know. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3158.12s)]
*  What is this other version of the person that was so laughably bad? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3159.28s)]
*  They had to oust him from office. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3163.48s)]
*  Who's this other person that we know who he is? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3165.96s)]
*  Because the version that we know appears to have dementia. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3168.56s)]
*  And lacks clarity. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3171.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I don't even know. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3173.52s)]
*  I don't know why I'm this is what's coming to my mind. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3175.92s)]
*  But I remember in like maybe like 2016, somewhere around that point. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3178.64s)]
*  I remember when when like radical feminism was really on the rise. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3184.96s)]
*  It was like kind of like woke culture amongst like young kids was really like [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3189.6s)]
*  the cool thing. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3193.32s)]
*  And I remember like arguing with like feminists about this. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3194.68s)]
*  And there was back then rape culture was a big thing. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3198.56s)]
*  They were talking about how we live in a rape culture. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3202.52s)]
*  And I remember it was like I was arguing with this feminist chick who she worked [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3205.08s)]
*  at a comedy club. She was a nice chick, but she we would argue and stuff. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3209.12s)]
*  And it was summer in New York City. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3214.32s)]
*  It was in the East Village. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3217.44s)]
*  And it's the middle of summertime. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3218.8s)]
*  And literally outside the window, like an Eastville comedy club, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3220.92s)]
*  it used to be the front was like a big glass window. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3224.36s)]
*  So you just look onto the street. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3226.48s)]
*  And outside the window, it's the East Village and it's young girls dressed in [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3228.08s)]
*  like, you know, scantily clothed young girls. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3233.6s)]
*  And like I remember just being like, well, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3237.7200000000003s)]
*  like you're saying there's a rape culture, but like look out on the street and girls [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3240.0s)]
*  are like walking around like I'm just saying you don't find that in the Congo. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3244.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3248.16s)]
*  Like it's just like a kind of thing where you're like, well, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3248.88s)]
*  I don't even know what to say when you're claiming this. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3251.0s)]
*  And she was literally claiming Congo stats like she was going one [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3254.2000000000003s)]
*  and four women are raped and all of this stuff. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3257.92s)]
*  And I'm like, but like, wouldn't that fuck with you? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3259.8s)]
*  If like I was like, hey, in the Congo, we're actually one in four women are raped. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3262.16s)]
*  They don't tend to be walking around in short shorts with their booties hanging [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3266.44s)]
*  out, like kind of flirting with the guy. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3270.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3272.36s)]
*  Like you just don't kind of see. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3273.16s)]
*  And again, I almost like I remember being [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3274.56s)]
*  at a loss where I was almost just like, I don't know how to take on your argument [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3277.52s)]
*  other than to just be like, but look, but like, like, are we both talking [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3281.48s)]
*  about the same world here? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3285.92s)]
*  And again, I'm almost left with this feeling when when you describe Joe Biden [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3287.6s)]
*  and your words to describe him are aware and clear. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3292.44s)]
*  It's like, I mean, I get it's like compared to what I mean, yeah, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3300.08s)]
*  I guess we live in a rape culture in the sense that like there are people who are [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3303.92s)]
*  raped, you know, I mean, I guess Joe Biden is clear compared to a golden retriever. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3307.32s)]
*  But compared to like other human beings who talk. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3314.7599999999998s)]
*  What those are the adjectives that you would use to describe him? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3319.12s)]
*  Clear, self-aware, a depth of knowledge. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3324.4s)]
*  Joe Biden speaks in slogans and he can't even say the slogans. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3330.48s)]
*  He stutters them, forgets what slogan he's [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3336.6s)]
*  in the middle of saying and then says, well, you know, the thing. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3339.72s)]
*  And like, look, the fact that she even like Rob, like you have the fact that she even [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3343.8399999999997s)]
*  has to say he could have stumbled his way in the fact that she even has to bring up [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3350.08s)]
*  that the NATO summit was at 8 p.m., Rob. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3355.64s)]
*  8 p.m. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3360.48s)]
*  Like only to a senile person is that the wee hours of the night. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3362.52s)]
*  Who like what what functioning healthy [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3368.7599999999998s)]
*  person has I'm sorry, 8 p.m. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3372.08s)]
*  as an excuse. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3375.64s)]
*  That it was at eight. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3378.44s)]
*  I mean, one thing if you were saying three [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3380.8s)]
*  in the morning, but you're saying it was after dinner and you know how he gets [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3382.96s)]
*  sleepy, this is just so ridiculous and like I mean, I don't know, man. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3387.2799999999997s)]
*  Again. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3392.48s)]
*  Look, I did not. She said everyone knows. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3395.16s)]
*  I actually did not know that Mika was on the record saying he shouldn't drop out, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3396.84s)]
*  that she was one of the few who actually dug in. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3400.56s)]
*  But like the idea that after all of this, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3403.08s)]
*  you're going to try to like rehabilitate the idea that Joe Biden wasn't too senile [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3405.44s)]
*  to run for president. It's like of all it kind of feels like the corporate media [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3411.4s)]
*  and the Democrats are almost like they're just under fire from like the opposing [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3415.96s)]

*  All right, let's get back into the show. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3502.08s)]
*  I have a brilliant idea. You ready for this? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3503.56s)]
*  Why don't we run the Dina Brzezinski experiment and just tell Joe Biden he's [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3505.6400000000003s)]
*  still president? I don't think he'll realize. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3510.56s)]
*  And ask him any world issue that you want to ask him how we should deal with it. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3512.92s)]
*  Just get a room, decorate it like it's well, he doesn't even go to the Oval Office [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3516.84s)]
*  anymore. He just has the little teeny tiny desk outside of the Oval Office. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3520.2400000000002s)]
*  So it wouldn't take much to Truman show [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3523.28s)]
*  convincing Joe Biden that he's still the president and let him make. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3526.0s)]
*  How much money does Joe Biden need? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3530.84s)]
*  I think he's made it all run through Ukraine or whatever. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3533.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, like I said, I mean, the amount of people they're making on these payouts. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3536.1600000000003s)]
*  You got this book deal for Kamala for 20 million. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3541.04s)]
*  Who let's keep that dumbass in front of the TV cameras and see what the horseshit [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3543.84s)]
*  she says next. I say for both of them, let's get them television contracts. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3547.1600000000003s)]
*  But the Joe Biden show will be like the Truman show. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3551.0s)]
*  And we'll get him that little teeny tiny desk that he makes his little [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3553.84s)]
*  announcements from. We'll get him a teleprompter. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3556.52s)]
*  We can keep his team intact and let's see how he presidents over the next four years. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3558.6800000000003s)]
*  I'd like literally get Joe Biden in an interview and just ask him a good [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3563.2000000000003s)]
*  president. Biden display a depth of knowledge on any issue. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3568.52s)]
*  Your choice. You know, me, your choice. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3573.44s)]
*  What issue it is. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3576.28s)]
*  No, really explain a depth of knowledge. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3577.28s)]
*  By the way, this is what's so this is what's so like maddening and also hilarious [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3579.28s)]
*  about Sam Harris or Chris Cuomo talking shit about me. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3584.4s)]
*  You know, oh, yeah, this is the lady with the team. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3587.0s)]
*  This is the lady who got better data than us. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3589.0400000000004s)]
*  Then she's standing by. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3591.2000000000003s)]
*  No, Joe Biden can still do the job. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3592.44s)]
*  That's the team of journalists behind her doing the research so that she can make [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3594.84s)]
*  more informed news than us. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3598.28s)]
*  Exactly. Those are the people with the team. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3599.76s)]
*  And the person she's talking about is the president of the United States of America. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3602.1600000000003s)]
*  And say whatever you want to about my views on the history of the conflict in [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3606.36s)]
*  Ukraine or in the history of Israel, Palestine or anything like that. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3611.28s)]
*  Joe Biden can't show a depth of knowledge on any issue that could even compete with [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3614.5600000000004s)]
*  what I know about this shit. And that's that's objective. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3620.96s)]
*  I'm not saying nobody could. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3624.1200000000003s)]
*  There's lots of people who can. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3625.36s)]
*  There's lots of people who have a depth of knowledge way beyond mine. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3626.48s)]
*  Plenty of them. But like your criticism, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3629.8s)]
*  the president of the United States doesn't have that. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3632.56s)]
*  And this whole media apparatus with all of their prestige and money and resources, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3635.16s)]
*  they're sitting there just pretending that he does when we all know it's bullshit. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3640.48s)]
*  I listen, I do. I got to wrap on that because I do got to get moving. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G4RPO5sEfA&t=3644.48s)]
